The following analysis was forwarded to me from a friend of a friend who has a contact on Stockhouse.ca (yes, I know, Ferris passed out at 31 flavors).  Here you go:
We are District Court 6 and the bar for 6 is lower than other districts so that is a positive. We just need abuse of discretion. They only argue on the orals on a couple of key points?the points that were in the briefs are still live. Couple of key points are the shifting of the burden from the defense to plaintiff is a key point in law?.you can?t do that . Another key point is that if you are going go compare old to new you have to do it against the claims. That answered Judge Newman s questions as to where the thin line is. The line is you can?t just say I always did this you, have to prove it.
Judge Newman was the judge who did the Bonneau case they used as the sample case of not allowing an error to carry over and she was also on the Zenith panel which was precedent case. Other key point on Buddy help is when the defense said Buddy Help was valid under the courts claim construction Judge Lioi should have shut validity down immediately then,  as you can?t argue outside the lines of claim construction. ?.or on what they said One might do to stretch the claims. Doesn?t matter?and they didn?t argue any other alternatives to validity which they would have to had to do,
I think there were more points of law that were in there than might have shown.

We are District Court 6 and the bar for 6 is lower than other districts so that is a positive. We just need abuse of discretion. They only argue on the orals on a couple of key points?the points that were in the briefs are still live. Couple of key points are the shifting of the burden from the defense to plaintiff is a key point in law?.you can?t do that . Another key point is that if you are going go compare old to new you have to do it against the claims. That answered Judge Newman s questions as to where the thin line is. The line is you can?t just say I always did this you, have to prove it.
Judge Newman was the judge who did the Bonneau case they used as the sample case of not allowing an error to carry over and she was also on the Zenith panel which was precedent case. Other key point on Buddy help is when the defense said Buddy Help was valid under the courts claim construction Judge Lioi should have shut validity down immediately then,  as you can?t argue outside the lines of claim construction. ?.or on what they said One might do to stretch the claims. Doesn?t matter?and they didn?t argue any other alternatives to validity which they would have to had to do,

Congrats--you really nailed it with this insightful look at NanoOne... 

IMHO, If solid state battery is to emerge from the murky swamp of new battery configurations, the missing link to success is clearly surface technology of both the anode and cathode.

It is not so much-if solid state offers much safer and orders of magnitude gains in efficacy over the current -oh os 20th Century battery designs, -but will the design gain acceptance and will it scale?? The jury is still out, but the day may well come when II readers look back at your article and rue the day they didn&#039;t jump on NanoOne. 

Of course only time will tell. But, NanoOne is far down the learning curve and from what I hear from my sources-they are also way ahead of the crowd they are selling to (names withheld for the obvious)--I only hope it is not the old adage of &#039;casting pearls before swine&#039;.
