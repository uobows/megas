<p>Not much has changed since the previous version. Most notable is the addition of the domain name / servername module. When you use more domain names in one install, you can now filter your widgets on that too. Thanks for the financial support of HANNA Instruments, Mexico to make this module possible.</p>

This is release bumps the compatible version for WordPress to 4.6. A few things have been changed tho which might have an impact on users that (still) use QTranslate or one of it&#8217;s forks.</p>
<p>Because of the many forks that have been created and all going in a different direction not honoring the original code of QTranslate I had no other choice then (temporary) removing support for QTranslate and all it&#8217;s forks. Supporting a fork would mean breaking another fork. I can not allow that my plugin breaks another plugin or even worse a complete WordPress site.</p>
<p>Other changes that have been done in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added conditional check for client IP address (handy when using CLI)</li>
<li>Added support for featured image</li>
</ul>
<p>When you do a manual install of the plugin, as always make sure to completely remove the old plugin directory before installing the new version and do a deactivate &#8211; activate cycle of it.</p>

Some time ago, qTranslate has been adapted by a few other folks and renamed to qTranslate-X. Dynamic Widgets has added support for qTranslate-X starting with version 1.5.10.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to WordPress policies, the authors of qTranslate-X had to change some code. This resulted in a new incompatibility between qTranslate-X and Dynamic Widgets. For compatibility you can switch on a setting in qTranslate-X that makes Dynamic Widgets work again happily with qTranslate-X.</p>
<p>I quote one the authors of qTranslate-X in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/33-to-be-incompatible-with-dynamic-widgets" target="_blank">WordPress Forum topic</a>:<br />
There is an option in qTranslate-X, &#8220;Compatibility Functions&#8221;, which enables back a list of functions with <code>qtrans_</code> prefix: <a href="https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/faq/#CompatibilityFunctions" rel="nofollow">https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/faq/#CompatibilityFunctions</a></p>
<p>Of course, Dynamic Widgets will be changed so this setting will not be necessary anymore in a new version.</p>

<p>New feature requests are always taken into consideration. But it happens quite a few times I get requests I&#8217;m not certain there would be an audience for it. For that kind of requests I will create a poll and see the response on it. Based on the outcome of the poll I&#8217;ll take the request in consideration again.

<p>Anyway, this is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed Mobile Device to Device for more expansion.</li>
<li>Removed the version number from the HTML comment.</li>
<li>Fixed a few strict warnings.</li>
<li>Fixed a few vulnerabilities discovered by Leon Juranic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: When you upgrade manually, remove the dynamic-widgets directory first!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: A small but can be annoying bug has been found. The URL and Pages module does not show your settings. The settings are working until you save new settings without reproducing the settings for URL and Page. A fix has already been released in the development version.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2: </strong>Apparently something went wrong with my test routines. Another small bug was found in the Single Post Category. Also this has been fixed in the development version.</p>
