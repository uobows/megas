<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Bristol?s first community radio station BCfm launched the inaugural Bristol Diversity Awards as part of their tenth anniversary.  The glittering celebrations held at the Marriott was attended by a cross section of Bristol's community. The  Award ceremony sponsored by the RAF was seen as a perfect fit with Bcfm as the force continues it's mission to increase representation in the service.  </strong></p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">During the evening BCfm announced the award categories for 2018 and opened the platform for voting. Next years nomination process will be open to anyone who lives, works, serves or operates within the greater Bristol area, with over 25 award categories to choose from.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">BCfm Radio CEO Pat Hart said ?The Bristol Diversity Awards represent everything we do as a radio station and help to encourage businesses, individuals, community organisations and statutory groups to embrace all areas of diversity and equality with the opportunity to get recognised for it in a high profile way.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">With an array of specific award ceremonies already taking place in Bristol it was felt that a format that included all diversity strands would both strengthen and compliment the existing ceremonies?.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">During the evening Royal Air Force Group Captain Wendy Rothery in her inspirational address said ?A diverse workforce is at the heart of everything we do and by focusing on Diversity and Inclusion within our recruiting we will harness the full potential of our people and ensure we retain and recruit the right people with the skills we need both now and in the future.  BCfm are supporting us in that process and in turn we aim to continue to support them?.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">Special guests included deputy Mayor Asher Craig and Lord Lieutenant Peaches Golding. </p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">TV personality &amp; award winning broadcaster Sherrie Eugene-Hart together with  Patrick Hart hosted the proceedings.</p>

<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Bristol?s first community radio station BCfm launched the inaugural Bristol Diversity Awards as part of their tenth anniversary.  The glittering celebrations held at the Marriott was attended by a cross section of Bristol's community. The  Award ceremony sponsored by the RAF was seen as a perfect fit with Bcfm as the force continues it's mission to increase representation in the service.  </strong></p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">During the evening BCfm announced the award categories for 2018 and opened the platform for voting. Next years nomination process will be open to anyone who lives, works, serves or operates within the greater Bristol area, with over 25 award categories to choose from.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">BCfm Radio CEO Pat Hart said ?The Bristol Diversity Awards represent everything we do as a radio station and help to encourage businesses, individuals, community organisations and statutory groups to embrace all areas of diversity and equality with the opportunity to get recognised for it in a high profile way.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">With an array of specific award ceremonies already taking place in Bristol it was felt that a format that included all diversity strands would both strengthen and compliment the existing ceremonies?.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">During the evening Royal Air Force Group Captain Wendy Rothery in her inspirational address said ?A diverse workforce is at the heart of everything we do and by focusing on Diversity and Inclusion within our recruiting we will harness the full potential of our people and ensure we retain and recruit the right people with the skills we need both now and in the future.  BCfm are supporting us in that process and in turn we aim to continue to support them?.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">Special guests included deputy Mayor Asher Craig and Lord Lieutenant Peaches Golding. </p>
<p class="rtejustify"> </p>
<p class="rtejustify">TV personality &amp; award winning broadcaster Sherrie Eugene-Hart together with  Patrick Hart hosted the proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Years of campaigning have finally made a difference following a unanimous vote of the Bristol Music Trust just before Easter to rename the Colston Hall .</strong></p>
<p>BMS Chief Executive  Louise Mitchell made the announcement shortly after 11am today saying " We don't want an association with slave trader Edward Colston" she also said that the name was "toxic" and "The name Colston does not reflect the trust?s values as a progressive, forward thinking and open arts organisation" The hall is due to close next year for extensive refurbishing and will re-open in 2020 with a new name yet to be announced. She added after being questioned by BCfm's news team that "She was ready for a backlash but was confident they had made the right decision"</p>
<p>CEO of BCfm Pat Hart who was present at the announcement said "Ths is a major milstone for our city after so many years of campaigning for this change. Freedom fighter and civil Rights activist Dr Paul Stephenson who was present at the announcement was ridiculed by many including the Bristol Post when he called for the Colston statue to be removed and the hall to have it's name changed many years ago. Our very own One Love Breakfast alongside more recently the Countering Colston group have continued the fight and we are pleased that the right decision has been made" He also added  "I was part of the group that helped to transfer the hall from the council to the Bristol Music Trust and also helped to write the organisations mission statement, I know the former Cultural Change Manager Paul Barnett will be very happy and I thank Marti Burgess and all of those who have helped to facilitate this change"</p>
<p>Bcfm broadcaster Ivan Jackson also recently wrote an artice about the name change in Bristol 247 which went national and again ignited the debate that has eventually led to this decision.</p>
<p>Here at BCfm Radio we are pleased that our diverse city finally has a concert venue that will be the pride of the entire city, a city that boasts Europe's first directly elected mayor of Afrikan Caribbean descent and one of the most diverse and representative councils in Bristol's history.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><u>About BCfm</u></p>
<p class="rtecenter">For 10 years Bristol Community FM has broadcast every conceivable aspect of life in this creative, complex, and colourful city. From our inner-city studios, we deliver an unmatched coverage of local arts, culture, politics, current affairs and sport, whilst not shying away from difficult issues and regularly holding local institutions to account. This quality and scope of programming has seen the station become one of Bristol?s most respected media outlets, often setting the agenda for news and breaking stories, and becoming the recipient of local and national awards. BCfm is here to inform, educate and entertain the people of Bristol, with an ethos of diversity and inclusivity. We?re particularly proud of serving - and involving ? those under-represented by the mainstream media, including diverse, hard-to-reach and (sometimes) disadvantaged communities. For them we offer support, companionship and ? most importantly ? a voice.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"> </p>
<p class="rtecenter">BCfm is a registered charity and entirely run by volunteers who, freely giving their time and skills, share a passion for both radio and the city they broadcast to. Charity no.  1123827</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><u>About BCfm</u></p>
<p class="rtecenter">For 10 years Bristol Community FM has broadcast every conceivable aspect of life in this creative, complex, and colourful city. From our inner-city studios, we deliver an unmatched coverage of local arts, culture, politics, current affairs and sport, whilst not shying away from difficult issues and regularly holding local institutions to account. This quality and scope of programming has seen the station become one of Bristol?s most respected media outlets, often setting the agenda for news and breaking stories, and becoming the recipient of local and national awards. BCfm is here to inform, educate and entertain the people of Bristol, with an ethos of diversity and inclusivity. We?re particularly proud of serving - and involving ? those under-represented by the mainstream media, including diverse, hard-to-reach and (sometimes) disadvantaged communities. For them we offer support, companionship and ? most importantly ? a voice.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"> </p>
<p class="rtecenter">BCfm is a registered charity and entirely run by volunteers who, freely giving their time and skills, share a passion for both radio and the city they broadcast to. Charity no.  1123827</p>
