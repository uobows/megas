<p>From 25 May 2018 the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) will be replaced by The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it will bring important changes to the ways data is stored and processed by businesses. The introduction of GDPR is designed to set clear rules for businesses to follow when collecting and storing personal data, it also allows everyone to understand their rights in relation to the information held about them. The new regulation was created as a reaction to increased internet usage and sales of personal information, allowing consumers more power over their personal data.</p>
<p>The new law will bring data protection in the UK in line with the rest of the UK and nothing (not even Brexit) will stop it &#8211; So it is best to start preparing now! Your business must have strong policies in place to avoid scrutiny and potential fines. This article will highlight some of the key elements of the GDPR, and the best practice for companies.</p>
<p><strong>What are the new GDPR principles?</strong></p>
<p>The general framework of GDPR is similar to DPA, and the level of compliance is dependent on how much, and the type of data collected. In essence &#8211; the more data collected and processed by your company, the more compliance is required under GDPR.</p>
<p>You must, however, still afford privacy protection, notification and consent and protect the information by secure storage, regardless of your business&#8217;s size. GDPR places a larger focus on protecting an individual&#8217;s rights about their data, therefore when companies collect and process the data, they must also justify the legality of it.</p>
<p><strong>What is meant by &#8216;Data&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>An individual&#8217;s personal data can relate to their name and address, but can also include fingerprints, DNA, recorded calls, date of birth and now has become more stringent, including any information that can be traced back to a single person. All of this information will be covered and protected by the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>How does this affect recording phone calls? And how can I ensure I am doing this legally?</strong></p>
<p>If you record phone calls you must fulfil any of the following conditions to ensure you are doing so legally:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Receive consent from the individual(s) in the phone call to record.</li>
<li>Justify the necessity of the recording, i.e. to fulfil a contract, or for legal requirements.</li>
<li>It is necessary to protect the interests of one or more participants.</li>
<li>The recording is in the public interest, or necessary for the exercise the official authority.</li>
<li>It is in the interest of the recorder, only overridden if they conflict with the interest of the participant of the call.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a business is using call recording to monitor customer service, they are still left to fulfil the first condition to be fully compliant. The fifth condition may also apply as it could be argued that staff quality assurance outweighs the interest of privacy.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean should you want to continue recording phone calls? Under the DPA, when a recording takes place the individual must be informed of the purpose and how the information will be processed. If the participant continued the call consent was assumed, and this was acceptable and common practice. The GDPR implements tighter regulations, meaning implied/assumed consent is no longer enough. There must be express consent given, either by recording verbal consent or having AI terminate the call if consent is not given.</p>
<p><strong>Rights to Access Data Have Also Changed</strong>.</p>
<p>Individuals will now have absolute access to any information stored about them, and this will need to be identified, retrieved and provided to them upon request. Therefore, as a business you must implement a an efficient method of doing this upon request. In addition, should the individual request to have your details removed you must do so with immediate effect. Any policies that are put into place to ensure this is done must be co ordinated with your IT and call recording provider to ensure you can fulfil your claims.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Business must be able to actively display their compliance to the new rules under the &#8216;Principle of Accountability.&#8217; The GDPR stresses the importance of implementing data protection systems with immediate effect. Creating an extensive policy is not going to be useful if your staff and providers are not going to be able to fulfil the obligations. Having an honest and realistic policy will be most effective, and will be easier to demonstrate should you need to prove fulfilment.</p>
<p>In order to implement any policy effectively there are several steps that must be completed. Including, drafting policies and protocols, and training staff to make them fully aware of the new provisions followed by careful management and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<p>Along with the new policies implemented there are also new penalties designed to deter and punish organisations committing further breaches. Under the DPA, organisations could be fined up to &#163;500,000. However, under the new GDPR fines can range from 2-4% of global turnover, depending on how severe the case was. These fines are designed to have a large impact on non-compliant companies, therefore it is important to act now.</p>

<p>Talk to many C-suite executives about their organisational social strategy, and they&#8217;ll give you the same vague answer: &#8220;Yes, we do social media. Our company has a Twitter and Facebook account...&#8221; In 2018, this statement is akin to saying that a company &#8216;does&#8217; human resources, finance or marketing. When consumers expect instantaneous response, bespoke offers, numerous buying options and exemplary customer service from every organisation they come into contact with &#8212; a company simply &#8216;doing social&#8217;, the bare minimum, will soon be left at the wayside.</p>
<p><strong>Is your company socially mature?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that social marketing has well and truly matured.There are now numerous ways to collate, analyse and use data &#8212; all of which can help the C-suite make better business decisions if utilised correctly. The problem however, is that shockingly few organisations are actually socially mature enough to recognise the power of that data, let alone use it in a way which will aid with brand growth or increase customer loyalty.</p>
<p>But what is social maturity? Put simply it&#8217;s the ultimate benchmark when it comes to how companies approach social media, including how they deploy and experiment with it to better engage and communicate with customers, partners, stakeholders and colleagues. If an organisation is socially mature for example, then it will likely excel across social selling, advertising and online customer experience.</p>
<p>This is all well and good, but, when the archetypal organisation is driven from the top down, how do marketing and social teams demonstrate the business value of social to help grow that maturity, educate the CEO and secure executive buy-in?</p>
<p><strong>Talk the C-suite&#8217;s language</strong></p>
<p>The C-suite in general, and specifically the CEO, cares about three things: making money, saving money and managing risk. It&#8217;s up to social teams and marketing executives to highlight to them how their investments in social are going to complement their overall goals; mapping social metrics to business outcomes so that teams can move forward in their programme with executive support.</p>
<p>This is often easier said than done, but for starters social and marketing executives need to start thinking how everything they undertake, including the data they glean from social tools, can be fed back into the senior management team to demonstrate ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Measurable and actionable</strong></p>
<p>&#8216;Tracking&#8217; is the all-important word here, everything pulled from social needs to be measurable and actionable. Because of this it&#8217;s imperative organisations are able to integrate their social channels with analytics and CRM tools so relevant business insights can be fully realised. Marketing and social teams need to avoid &#8216;vanity&#8217; metrics such as number of likes, retweets, or followers. Instead the focus needs to be on the areas of social media which are actually driving value, did a specific campaign have a marked impact on click-throughs to a particular product or service? If so, what specific actions within that campaign drove value?</p>
<p>By knowing these actions, social teams can duplicate them, adjust and tweak, and continue to monitor if these have an ongoing correlation on revenue or conversion. If so, then you&#8217;ve got something that the C-suite can understand, which will greatly enhance the case for additional resources or investment in technology to give the programme legs.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking down barriers</strong></p>
<p>With increased resource comes the next piece of the puzzle. True social maturity relies on social running across departments beyond just marketing, taking into account other departmental objectives such as HR, sales and internal communications to name but a few. Should these departments operate in isolation, without being able to utilise the positive impact of social for their specific needs, it will hold areas of the organisation back from effective communication, innovation and progress.</p>
<p>It is therefore key to roll out the right measurement, training and tools to help grow the scale of social maturity, and start seeing real returns on real business objectives. Do this and those innovative buying options, award-winning customer service and targeted offers won&#8217;t be that difficult to roll out. Make no mistake, social can be the number one equaliser for brands &#8212; it just often needs the backing of the C-suite behind it.</p>

";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1522306800;}i:2;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:61:"Peer Motivated Shoppers ? The Rarest and Most Loyal Customers";s:11:"description";s:6726:"
<p>The number of factors that determine a shopper&#8217;s purchasing habits are increasing as retailers expand their offerings both online and in-store. With some consumers more influence by external factors - like people and prestige, and others conscious of practical logistics, it&#8217;s important for marketers to understand how we&#8217;re different and tap into what works.</p>
<p>To uncover the main drivers of consumer shopping habits we conducted global research with over 5,000 consumers in 13 countries to create the <a href="http://webloyalty.co.uk/Page/the-5ps-of-shopper-motivation" target="_blank">5 Ps of Shopper Motivation report</a>. It set out to understand and identified five key shopper profiles: Peer, Price, Practicality, Personalisation and Perk Motivated Shoppers.</p>
<p><strong>The Peer Motivated Shopper</strong></p>
<p>While this is the smallest group identified within the report, the Peer Motivated Shopper is the most loyal. Taking advice, inspiration and recommendations from friends, family members and online comments, the Peer Motivated Shopper likes to follow the lead of their peers &#8211; and are most likely to shop daily (16%) when compared to Price Motivated Shoppers (6%).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those aged 25-34 years old are most likely to fall into this category of shopper (11% globally). This tallies with <a href="https://barkley.s3.amazonaws.com/barkleyus/AmericanMillennials.pdf" target="_blank">Barclay Consulting Group</a> research, which found that 68% of this age group won&#8217;t make a major decision until they&#8217;ve discussed it with a few people they trust, compared to 52% of those aged between 35 and 74.</p>
<p>Added to this, <a href="http://www.hearst.co.uk/news/new-language-luxury-millennials-changing-shape-luxury" target="_blank">The New Language of Luxury</a> found that before making a purchase, the younger generation turns to technology to seek reassurance from their peers with 34% talking about it via text/chat/ messaging. Excited to share news about their latest shopping haul, the research also discovered that 22% turn to social media to showcase their latest shopping purchase. Clearly, this generation care about what their peers think. With this in mind, why are they important and how can digital marketing professionals engage with Peer Motivated Shoppers?</p>
<p>As the most loyal consumer group, Peer Motivated Shoppers are the most likely to promote their favourite retailer to others, 65% compared to 38% of Price Motivated Shoppers. This is essential as it is estimated that those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s will have the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2017/10/31/how-to-tap-into-the-millennial-200-billion-buying-power-with-social-media/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#947cd6e11614" target="_blank">most spending power of any generation from 2018</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Making the most of digital</strong></p>
<p>For this generation, it&#8217;s not surprising that they are turning to their peers and family members as well as online reviews and social media channels for instant shopping advice as highlighted by <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/retail-consumer/publications/assets/total-retail-global-report.pdf" target="_blank">PwC&#8217;s Total Retail report</a>.</p>
<p>The increasing use of social media by this consumer category makes purchasing a product a more communal experience. This sees friends, family members and online communities all being kept up to date with a shopper&#8217;s purchase both before and after the event. To make this easier social shopping <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-social-shopping-websites-3486565" target="_blank">apps such as ModCloth and Wanelo have been developed</a>. These platforms enable users to share their latest purchases, find similar products and build a community of people with like-minded shopping styles.</p>
<p>It is essential that retailers continue to strive to meet the needs of this small but powerful digitally-minded group, as they are the most ardent of supporters and will buy products again and again. In fact, the 5Ps report found that Peer Motivated Shoppers regularly shop more than once a week. Many brands have already reaped the benefits of effectively reaching this peer-motivated consumer category, for example:</p>
<p>&#8226; In 2017, clothing retailer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/26/boohoo-profits-nearly-double-celebrities-instagram-online-fashion-retail" target="_blank">Boohoo nearly doubled its profits</a> following an Instagram influencer campaign where it used celebrities and bloggers to promote its products. With peer recommendations influential for reaching this audience, online influencer campaigns are set to continue throughout 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8226; Social media platforms are also continuing to offer brands new ways of reaching customers. For example, Pinterest is using its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/25/target-is-adding-pinterests-visual-search-tool-to-its-app-and-website/" target="_blank">Lens feature</a> to partner with retailers, allowing customers to simply take a photograph of a product and find a similar item available from the brand. Instagram has also upgraded its Stories function to allow brands to directly reach consumers by introducing its &#8220;Swipe up&#8221; function. With <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/ads-in-stories-updates/" target="_blank">250 million people around the world watching and creating Instagram Stories every day</a>, this is no doubt the first in a number of planned upgrades that will enable brands and consumers to generate conversations from the popular app.</p>
<p>&#8226; New social shopping apps have also been created to allow users to share photographs of their favourite purchases. Combining a shopping platform with a social media channel, apps such as <a href="http://appshopper.com/social-networking/zwibe" target="_blank">Qwibe</a>, allow users to share images whilst shopping, gain followers and purchase products directly through it.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s consumer shopping habits are driven by an increasing number of influences, understanding a retailer&#8217;s target audience is a complex and ever-changing task. For brands and marketing professionals targeting the younger generation, it&#8217;s clear that peer recommendations and product insight delivered via digital channels are vital to reaching, engaging and keeping the most loyal consumer group happy.</p>

<p>For this generation, it&#8217;s not surprising that they are turning to their peers and family members as well as online reviews and social media channels for instant shopping advice as highlighted by <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/retail-consumer/publications/assets/total-retail-global-report.pdf" target="_blank">PwC&#8217;s Total Retail report</a>.</p>
<p>The increasing use of social media by this consumer category makes purchasing a product a more communal experience. This sees friends, family members and online communities all being kept up to date with a shopper&#8217;s purchase both before and after the event. To make this easier social shopping <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-social-shopping-websites-3486565" target="_blank">apps such as ModCloth and Wanelo have been developed</a>. These platforms enable users to share their latest purchases, find similar products and build a community of people with like-minded shopping styles.</p>
<p>It is essential that retailers continue to strive to meet the needs of this small but powerful digitally-minded group, as they are the most ardent of supporters and will buy products again and again. In fact, the 5Ps report found that Peer Motivated Shoppers regularly shop more than once a week. Many brands have already reaped the benefits of effectively reaching this peer-motivated consumer category, for example:</p>
<p>&#8226; In 2017, clothing retailer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/26/boohoo-profits-nearly-double-celebrities-instagram-online-fashion-retail" target="_blank">Boohoo nearly doubled its profits</a> following an Instagram influencer campaign where it used celebrities and bloggers to promote its products. With peer recommendations influential for reaching this audience, online influencer campaigns are set to continue throughout 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8226; Social media platforms are also continuing to offer brands new ways of reaching customers. For example, Pinterest is using its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/25/target-is-adding-pinterests-visual-search-tool-to-its-app-and-website/" target="_blank">Lens feature</a> to partner with retailers, allowing customers to simply take a photograph of a product and find a similar item available from the brand. Instagram has also upgraded its Stories function to allow brands to directly reach consumers by introducing its &#8220;Swipe up&#8221; function. With <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/ads-in-stories-updates/" target="_blank">250 million people around the world watching and creating Instagram Stories every day</a>, this is no doubt the first in a number of planned upgrades that will enable brands and consumers to generate conversations from the popular app.</p>
<p>&#8226; New social shopping apps have also been created to allow users to share photographs of their favourite purchases. Combining a shopping platform with a social media channel, apps such as <a href="http://appshopper.com/social-networking/zwibe" target="_blank">Qwibe</a>, allow users to share images whilst shopping, gain followers and purchase products directly through it.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s consumer shopping habits are driven by an increasing number of influences, understanding a retailer&#8217;s target audience is a complex and ever-changing task. For brands and marketing professionals targeting the younger generation, it&#8217;s clear that peer recommendations and product insight delivered via digital channels are vital to reaching, engaging and keeping the most loyal consumer group happy.</p>

<p>The definition of a disruptor brand is a matter of some debate. Although no one would deny that brands like Airbnb and Uber are disruptive, back in 2015, Forbes considered Coca-Cola to be one of the 25 most disruptive brands of the year, all due to putting our names on its packaging. Apple too is often considered a disruptive brand, even though the company has been around since 1976. The common thread with most disruptive products or services, whether they are delivered by a start-up or by an established legacy brand, is that these brands are addressing conscious or unconscious consumer needs, through a combination of product innovation and branding, most commonly accessed via technology.</p>
<p>The role of digital marketing within the rise of the disruptor cannot be understated. After all, Airbnb only released its first TV ad when it was already valued at $2.5 billion, and had recorded 5 million stays in its properties. And Uber only released its first TV ad last year when it had already established itself as a world leader in city transport. Many disruptor brands owe huge initial growth to their clever digital marketing, and in this world of programmatic marketing it&#8217;s becoming increasingly important to get your targeting right.</p>
<p>So, if you are looking to disrupt a sector yourself, surely with digital we&#8217;re halfway there? And what can mainstream digital marketers learn from disruptors? Should we throw out the rulebook?</p>
<p>Think again! A new study by Network Research surveyed 1,500 people in the UK and explored consumers&#8217; attitudes to disruptors across a number of sectors. It found that no sector is safe from the impact of disruptors, whether that disruption is caused by a new player in the sector or a traditional competitor with an innovative new product.</p>
<p>For many marketers out there, the target consumer for disruptor brands would commonly be those of a certain age group; the tech-savvy, value-driven millennials. But the study found that it&#8217;s not all about millennials (for once) and disruptors are certainly not only attracting the young and hip. The highest users of disruptors were in the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups, not the 18-24 year olds. In fact, 30% of 18-24 year olds haven&#8217;t even used any of the 20 disruptor brands across the various categories we tested. But 42% of those aged 65+ had used one or more, and 20% of the segment most &#8216;into&#8217; buying disruptor brands were over 55.</p>
<p>So age demographics aren&#8217;t very defined, but what about income? Households with an annual income of over &#163;55K were key adopters with over 70% of them using these brands, with usage declining with income. But again, that isn&#8217;t to say that those on lower household incomes don&#8217;t use disruptor brands &#8211; around half of those in the lowest income bracket has used one of the brands on the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money&#8221; also helps explain why people use disruptors as the survey showed that the biggest reason consumers are buying into disruptors is value for money. When it comes to disruptors, value doesn&#8217;t mean just price &#8211; it&#8217;s that core offering of &#8216;worth&#8217; the customer feels, and what makes up that sense of worth depends on consumer attitudes.</p>
<p>The study reveals that traditional demographics don&#8217;t provide the entire picture for marketers, digital or otherwise. To drill into the type of people who are attracted to disruptors, we created an attitudinal segmentation to help us map out who does and doesn&#8217;t gravitate to disruptor brands, and why.. Our attitudinal questions were developed from a broad range of factors including how our respondents felt about the environment, their use of technology, and ways of choosing products and services, alongside softer elements such as how they perceived themselves. The resulting segmentation split consumers into five groups, running from the &#8216;Tried and testeds&#8217; and the &#8216;Mainstreamers&#8217;, who are relatively closed off to disruptors, through to the &#8216;Nonchalants&#8217;, and then finally to those most open to using disruptors - the &#8216;Go-getters&#8217; and the &#8216;Too cool for schools&#8217;.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re marketing a disruptive product or service, particularly as a small start-up, and you&#8217;re bootstrapping a digital advertising strategy because it&#8217;s one of the most cost-effective marketing solutions available to you, targeting can be vital in ensuring the success of a product.</p>
<p>The usual rules apply. Whatever your message, tailor it to your audience. Effective targeting is essential, but it is also important to understand that your audience will often be broader than you think, particularly if you&#8217;re using traditional demographics and traditional thinking to define your audience. For a disruptive brand, that 20% of the over 55s that are most &#8216;into&#8217; buying a disruptive product could be the make or break of market success, so think about what messages might resonate with them, not just those millenials!</p>

<p>Almost half (46%) of marketers only share customer insights, data and feedback with sales teams at most once a month, according to experience management company Qualtrics.</p>
<p>The Qualtrics research examines the extent to which marketers are working in a silo across many businesses. While integration with sales is lacking, the disconnect with other departments and teams is even more pronounced.</p>
<p>While 54% of marketers regularly share customer insights and feedback with sales, only 50% do so with customer service teams, 29% with the wider workforce, and 27% with the board or C-level executives.</p>
<p>While some marketers may question the need to keep the wider business in touch with customer insights, according to Qualtrics it is only by sharing data that businesses can develop truly effective customer experiences.</p>
<p>Leonie Brown, customer experience consultant at Qualtrics EMEA, said: &#8220;Great customer experiences cannot exist in a vacuum.
