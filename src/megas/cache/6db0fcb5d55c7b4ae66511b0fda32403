The interview was done by Max Lachaud (thanks again Max!) Now they published the complete interview online in French... so below you can find it in English. <a href="http://www.obskuremag.net/articles/les-dix-ans-denfant-terrible-interview-bonus-obskure-magazine-20/">See here for the French version / Obskure Mag online...</a><P>- What was your music background before the creation of Enfant Terrible? <P>From a very young age I listened to a lot of music but in the years before I started my label I was involved in writing about music for a lot for various web based and paper magazines. Next to that I was dj?ing and organizing parties and some live shows. These activities made me realize there was a lot of music out there which I liked and was not being released. So I decided to create a platform to release music I liked and thought some more people should hear. In the end it was and still is a way to get the music released I want to listen to myself? and I am very happy other people are also enjoying these releases?  <P>- Why did you choose this French expression as a name? <P>Of course it is French expression but we used to use it too in Holland? but it has become a bit out of fashion. If refers of course to Cocteau and it refers a lot to me? I know I can be difficult? but always with a reason? I like to do things my way when it comes to my label and in the past ten years this has caused several discussions with several people? but I have strict ideas about how things should be done and as it is my private time and private money I invest (I have a normal day job next to my label) I can define the rules and make it happen the way I want when it comes to my label? so for some people I am an Enfant Terrible? <P>- What were your intentions at the beginning of the label? <P>In the end I am music lover and a record collector? I create records I want to have and like to play at home? I do this with musicians I like and think some more people should know about? it is as simple as that.  <P>When it comes to production, promotion and distribution I follow a strict independent line as I believe in the small, the local, outsider stuff and so on? and I am only interested in getting music to the right people? people with the same loves and passions? I am not at all interested in reaching many people for the sake of reaching many people? but if artists I work with should be heard by more people then they should follow that path as well? and I will not stand in their way and will help if it fits my ideas of growth? <P>- At the beginning you did quite a few reissues of works by cult Dutch label Trumpett Records with bands such as Ende Shneaflet, The Actor or Doxa Sinistra, was it important to show the heritage and influence of the works of such artists? <P>I think it is always important to show the tradition you work in and show respect to your roots? so it was logical to release some Dutch (and Belgian) musicians I appreciate a lot and showed the way for musicians who came after them.  <P>Trumpett as a label was not an example for my label as such but the music they released and the independent attitude is totally in line with what I do? or when it comes to the music at least for some parts.  <P>- What is your point of view on all those reissues of bands from the eighties and labels specialized in it, because in some ways you contributed to this resurgence of sounds from the eighties? <P>Yes, I also think I contributed to this? there were labels before me of course who released 80?s proto-elektro, avant-garde electronic pop and so on? like Kernkrach, Was Soll Das Schallplatten and Genetic for example?  <P>Some years ago I wrote an article on what should be called recycle culture in which I stated that I think we have reached a point where quality seems no longer to be important. Anything from the 80?s is re-released now? even stuff that for a good reason never before got released? as lots of these bands and music had no artistic or cultural relevance back then? and still not? <P>But well? many people seem to like these records anyway as they sell very well? but I decided to not play this game and instead focus on contemporary music and also for an important  part on contemporary Dutch musicians? as I think music from today  is more relevant and deserves more attention and support as some obscure and forgotten tape from 30 years ago with a kind of music I have heard many times before and then done in a better way? <P>This said I do not think all 80?s re-releases are to be ignored? from time to time some true gem is still being discovered or a really nice and hard to find record is put to vinyl again? in these cases I will buy these records and in some cases also support and sell it in my webshop. <P>- Can you tell me more about all the sublabels linked to Enfant Terrible and the upcoming Vrystaete? <P>There are only three sublabels which saw the light through the years until now? Hex Grammofoonplaten is a label which came to life as I wanted to do a compilation which put the energy from the Hex parties we did in Amsterdam from 2004 to 2008 to vinyl? to get the party spirit into people?s homes.   <P>These parties will always stay with me? I believe we were the first to have a true high quality new wave  / post punk night with a dancenight with songs from the past and always the newest releases and contemporary live acts on stage. These nights built a name for themselves and even people from Belgium, Germany and France came to visit us. <P>We stayed away from the clichés and went for a broad spectrum of sounds? from punk to industial to minimal and from neo-folk to Neue Deutsche Welle and deathrock?  <P>I did not release a lot on this sublabel but who knows what is to come? I have some ideas for records in this series? <P>In 2012 I started with Gooiland Elektro? a label focused on dancemusic like elektro and techno? but of course music rooted in the traditions I already worked in? so stuff like EBM, new beat and some flirts with italo disco? Last year I released twelve 12?s which were received very well? more will come this year but a bit less as last year I think? <P>This as I will also focus a bit on the new Vrystaete label? which will present music more or less related to folklore, psychedelic and lo-fi sounds? and people will be able to hear again my new wave roots? but it will also be different? first up are an album by Niedowierzanie who released already two great albums with the German Treue Um Treue label. This new album is an amazing piece of folklore music mixed with contemporary electronic music elements. <P>Also coming this spring is the second album by Dutch duo Kaval? they produce some really good ambient music which has a link in mood and sound with the stuff from Hero Wouters from the 80?s which I released years ago. <P>More is coming later this year? for example psychedelic minimal music and melancholy folktronics? <P>- What are some of the records you have been very proud of releasing? Your personal favorites and highlights of the label? <P>This is a hard question as I like and love all the records I put out? for different reasons? and I appreciate all the collaborations a lot? but well? from the old days my favorites are the Doxa Sinistra album, the Hero Wouters album and the Kaa Antilope album. When it comes to contemporary music I am really happy with the Europ Europ Mellowharsher EP? this truly came out perfect? it is the music and it is the packaging and how this works together? but also the Distel album and the Kim Ki O album I play a lot here? and I love and will always love Sololust? his music is special to me and he is too as a person? <P>Possibly the biggest highlight for me personal is however the Exploitation 2LP soundtrack? so much time and work went into this and I see this as a great achievement how the 90 minutes of music flow? I am still proud how I created this narrative on vinyl?   <P>- In the same way, what are your Top 5 favorite records of all time? <P>Sorry? but this is a question which is impossible to answer I think? as there is so much good music out there? and I listen to all? from 60?s folk and psychedelic music to techno to noise to modern classical stuff? and so on? When it comes to pop music I have two favorite albums which are the first albums by The Velvet Underground and The Jesus And Mary Chain? <P>  - You have also discovered bands who have become well-known right now such as Agent Side Grinder or lately Distel received some very enthusiastic reviews and reception. How did you discover their music? <P>I am always listening to music, reading about music, searching for music? but in these cases? Agent Side Grinder? I booked Saralunden at the Hex party and the label owner told me he just started a new band? he sent me a cd-r with demos? real demo takes from  9 minutes or so? based on these I invited the band for my Hex night as well? after the concert I asked them to release a 7? with me and so we started to work together for some time?  <P>Distel was a live member of another band I knew from the Dutch scene and I do not remember well if I wrote him or he wrote me? but before we got in contact I had heard like about two songs on internet and I heard the talent of the musician in these tracks... he sent me a cd with two almost finished tracks and some other tracks in pre-versions and we took it from there? also first a 7? which sold very slowly to be honest? <P>- Why this choice to focus on dance stuff for Gooiland Elektro? <P>Enfant Terrible evolved more and more in some more experimental way with stuff like La Mort De L?Hippocampe, Europ Europ and Distel for example and I missed the energy of music you can dance to like dark elektro as Kommando 6 and Invasion Planete had released before? this together with me love for the energy and mood of EBM, new beat and early techno stuff was the perfect start for something new and which was still a logical next chapter for Enfant Terrible as a label? and I just have a lot of fun with this label and am really happy it is received so well?  <P>- What are the main difficulties for an independent label today? <P>Not sure?it depends on your strategy and what you consider independent? my notion of this is much stricter I guess as of some other people and labels? but making good quality records is expensive? especially in small editions? and then selling music which is not hip and trendy is hard? I am never making easy records I think? never releasing what is hot at that time? this as I do not care for that? I put out what I like and I aim at surprising people? and serving new sounds to people who follow my label? and doing something different as other labels? so it is harder to sell the records then when you release more typical minimal synth or electro stuff? also I like to work mostly with new and unknown artists and show the world these new sounds? this is also always harder as selling established artists? <P>- You have made very few CDs, always focusing on vinyles and cassettes. Is it because of a personal attachment to these formats? <P>Yes, for sure. I am a record collector and buy very few cd?s. Also in my house you will not see the cd?s? they are put out of sight? but the vinyls you will see? I like to play records? the ritual? the feeling? it is a real product which stays with you and as a label you can make much nicer out of it as with a cd? <P>Cassettes are a different thing? I love cassettes they are small and you can do great things with the packaging? like adding things to it or wrap it in something and so on?  <P>Basically I release vinyls. I did one cd which I maybe should have done as vinyl and I released one cd-r as a gift at a party for the visitors. Tapes are for special (art) projects or when the type of music fits better on this format? which is of course a personal vision? <P>There is by the way a change I will re-release the Distel album on cd as I think more people should hear this amazing album? but this will be done then in a co-production with another label? and it will be a product on its own? most likely different from the vinyl release in some ways? I expect to know more on this soon? <P>- Can you tell us more about the events that you organize apart from your label activity (exhibitions, concerts, etc.)? <P>In the past I organized more regular nights like the Hex parties? but I got fed up with this? to me it became more of the same every night and I wanted to create more freedom for a different kind of events. So I experimented with different nights at different locations? most of them being one time concepts? it varied from live performances at openings of exhibitions to a night at a theatre with the program following that of a theatre night out to a concert at the kitchen of avant-garde fashion store XXX of my friends in Berlin?  <P>So since 2008 I organize about two nights each year? often one of them in co-productions with another organizer or organization? sometimes in Holland and sometimes somewhere else? For 2014 I am currently planning an Enfant Terrible /  Gooiland Elektro night in Holland in April and a performance night at XXX in Berlin in June? and possibly later on a Vrystaete event? but the ideas for this need to take shape first?  <P>- How do you feel like for this 10th anniversary, and how do you intend to celebrate it? <P>I like to put some attention to it as I am proud of doing this for 10 years in the way I have done it? 10 years of true independence and 10 years of cultural activism? as I like to see it? so there is the ?I Am Enfant Terrible? compilation which I put together for this occasion? but things need to move on? so I focus on the future for the rest? with new events? a new label (Vrystaete) and always other new ideas and plans which I will try to realize? and with now a tradition of my own (as 10 years might be called a tradition on its own in my opinion) and a focus on the future I try to live the now? celebrate what has been realized but try to catch the energy of the moment and simply have fun producing nice records and enjoying good music and working with nice people? just as it started? <P>";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://terrible-music.blogspot.com/2014/05/interview-in-obskure-mag-10-years-of.html";s:6:"author";s:24:"noreply@blogger.com (ET)";s:7:"summary";s:14324:"Recently Obskure Mag from France published an interview with me on ten years of Enfant Terrible in their excellent paper magazine.

Now they published the complete interview online in French... so below you can find it in English. <a href="http://www.obskuremag.net/articles/les-dix-ans-denfant-terrible-interview-bonus-obskure-magazine-20/">See here for the French version / Obskure Mag online...</a><P>- What was your music background before the creation of Enfant Terrible? <P>From a very young age I listened to a lot of music but in the years before I started my label I was involved in writing about music for a lot for various web based and paper magazines. Next to that I was dj?ing and organizing parties and some live shows. These activities made me realize there was a lot of music out there which I liked and was not being released. So I decided to create a platform to release music I liked and thought some more people should hear. In the end it was and still is a way to get the music released I want to listen to myself? and I am very happy other people are also enjoying these releases?  <P>- Why did you choose this French expression as a name? <P>Of course it is French expression but we used to use it too in Holland? but it has become a bit out of fashion. If refers of course to Cocteau and it refers a lot to me? I know I can be difficult? but always with a reason? I like to do things my way when it comes to my label and in the past ten years this has caused several discussions with several people? but I have strict ideas about how things should be done and as it is my private time and private money I invest (I have a normal day job next to my label) I can define the rules and make it happen the way I want when it comes to my label? so for some people I am an Enfant Terrible? <P>- What were your intentions at the beginning of the label? <P>In the end I am music lover and a record collector? I create records I want to have and like to play at home? I do this with musicians I like and think some more people should know about? it is as simple as that.  <P>When it comes to production, promotion and distribution I follow a strict independent line as I believe in the small, the local, outsider stuff and so on? and I am only interested in getting music to the right people? people with the same loves and passions? I am not at all interested in reaching many people for the sake of reaching many people? but if artists I work with should be heard by more people then they should follow that path as well? and I will not stand in their way and will help if it fits my ideas of growth? <P>- At the beginning you did quite a few reissues of works by cult Dutch label Trumpett Records with bands such as Ende Shneaflet, The Actor or Doxa Sinistra, was it important to show the heritage and influence of the works of such artists? <P>I think it is always important to show the tradition you work in and show respect to your roots? so it was logical to release some Dutch (and Belgian) musicians I appreciate a lot and showed the way for musicians who came after them.  <P>Trumpett as a label was not an example for my label as such but the music they released and the independent attitude is totally in line with what I do? or when it comes to the music at least for some parts.  <P>- What is your point of view on all those reissues of bands from the eighties and labels specialized in it, because in some ways you contributed to this resurgence of sounds from the eighties? <P>Yes, I also think I contributed to this? there were labels before me of course who released 80?s proto-elektro, avant-garde electronic pop and so on? like Kernkrach, Was Soll Das Schallplatten and Genetic for example?  <P>Some years ago I wrote an article on what should be called recycle culture in which I stated that I think we have reached a point where quality seems no longer to be important. Anything from the 80?s is re-released now? even stuff that for a good reason never before got released? as lots of these bands and music had no artistic or cultural relevance back then? and still not? <P>But well? many people seem to like these records anyway as they sell very well? but I decided to not play this game and instead focus on contemporary music and also for an important  part on contemporary Dutch musicians? as I think music from today  is more relevant and deserves more attention and support as some obscure and forgotten tape from 30 years ago with a kind of music I have heard many times before and then done in a better way? <P>This said I do not think all 80?s re-releases are to be ignored? from time to time some true gem is still being discovered or a really nice and hard to find record is put to vinyl again? in these cases I will buy these records and in some cases also support and sell it in my webshop. <P>- Can you tell me more about all the sublabels linked to Enfant Terrible and the upcoming Vrystaete? <P>There are only three sublabels which saw the light through the years until now? Hex Grammofoonplaten is a label which came to life as I wanted to do a compilation which put the energy from the Hex parties we did in Amsterdam from 2004 to 2008 to vinyl? to get the party spirit into people?s homes.   <P>These parties will always stay with me? I believe we were the first to have a true high quality new wave  / post punk night with a dancenight with songs from the past and always the newest releases and contemporary live acts on stage. These nights built a name for themselves and even people from Belgium, Germany and France came to visit us. <P>We stayed away from the clichés and went for a broad spectrum of sounds? from punk to industial to minimal and from neo-folk to Neue Deutsche Welle and deathrock?  <P>I did not release a lot on this sublabel but who knows what is to come? I have some ideas for records in this series? <P>In 2012 I started with Gooiland Elektro? a label focused on dancemusic like elektro and techno? but of course music rooted in the traditions I already worked in? so stuff like EBM, new beat and some flirts with italo disco? Last year I released twelve 12?s which were received very well? more will come this year but a bit less as last year I think? <P>This as I will also focus a bit on the new Vrystaete label? which will present music more or less related to folklore, psychedelic and lo-fi sounds? and people will be able to hear again my new wave roots? but it will also be different? first up are an album by Niedowierzanie who released already two great albums with the German Treue Um Treue label. This new album is an amazing piece of folklore music mixed with contemporary electronic music elements. <P>Also coming this spring is the second album by Dutch duo Kaval? they produce some really good ambient music which has a link in mood and sound with the stuff from Hero Wouters from the 80?s which I released years ago. <P>More is coming later this year? for example psychedelic minimal music and melancholy folktronics? <P>- What are some of the records you have been very proud of releasing? Your personal favorites and highlights of the label? <P>This is a hard question as I like and love all the records I put out? for different reasons? and I appreciate all the collaborations a lot? but well? from the old days my favorites are the Doxa Sinistra album, the Hero Wouters album and the Kaa Antilope album. When it comes to contemporary music I am really happy with the Europ Europ Mellowharsher EP? this truly came out perfect? it is the music and it is the packaging and how this works together? but also the Distel album and the Kim Ki O album I play a lot here? and I love and will always love Sololust? his music is special to me and he is too as a person? <P>Possibly the biggest highlight for me personal is however the Exploitation 2LP soundtrack? so much time and work went into this and I see this as a great achievement how the 90 minutes of music flow? I am still proud how I created this narrative on vinyl?   <P>- In the same way, what are your Top 5 favorite records of all time? <P>Sorry? but this is a question which is impossible to answer I think? as there is so much good music out there? and I listen to all? from 60?s folk and psychedelic music to techno to noise to modern classical stuff? and so on? When it comes to pop music I have two favorite albums which are the first albums by The Velvet Underground and The Jesus And Mary Chain? <P>  - You have also discovered bands who have become well-known right now such as Agent Side Grinder or lately Distel received some very enthusiastic reviews and reception. How did you discover their music? <P>I am always listening to music, reading about music, searching for music? but in these cases? Agent Side Grinder? I booked Saralunden at the Hex party and the label owner told me he just started a new band? he sent me a cd-r with demos? real demo takes from  9 minutes or so? based on these I invited the band for my Hex night as well? after the concert I asked them to release a 7? with me and so we started to work together for some time?  <P>Distel was a live member of another band I knew from the Dutch scene and I do not remember well if I wrote him or he wrote me? but before we got in contact I had heard like about two songs on internet and I heard the talent of the musician in these tracks... he sent me a cd with two almost finished tracks and some other tracks in pre-versions and we took it from there? also first a 7? which sold very slowly to be honest? <P>- Why this choice to focus on dance stuff for Gooiland Elektro? <P>Enfant Terrible evolved more and more in some more experimental way with stuff like La Mort De L?Hippocampe, Europ Europ and Distel for example and I missed the energy of music you can dance to like dark elektro as Kommando 6 and Invasion Planete had released before? this together with me love for the energy and mood of EBM, new beat and early techno stuff was the perfect start for something new and which was still a logical next chapter for Enfant Terrible as a label? and I just have a lot of fun with this label and am really happy it is received so well?  <P>- What are the main difficulties for an independent label today? <P>Not sure?it depends on your strategy and what you consider independent? my notion of this is much stricter I guess as of some other people and labels? but making good quality records is expensive? especially in small editions? and then selling music which is not hip and trendy is hard? I am never making easy records I think? never releasing what is hot at that time? this as I do not care for that? I put out what I like and I aim at surprising people? and serving new sounds to people who follow my label? and doing something different as other labels? so it is harder to sell the records then when you release more typical minimal synth or electro stuff? also I like to work mostly with new and unknown artists and show the world these new sounds? this is also always harder as selling established artists? <P>- You have made very few CDs, always focusing on vinyles and cassettes. Is it because of a personal attachment to these formats? <P>Yes, for sure. I am a record collector and buy very few cd?s. Also in my house you will not see the cd?s? they are put out of sight? but the vinyls you will see? I like to play records? the ritual? the feeling? it is a real product which stays with you and as a label you can make much nicer out of it as with a cd? <P>Cassettes are a different thing? I love cassettes they are small and you can do great things with the packaging? like adding things to it or wrap it in something and so on?  <P>Basically I release vinyls. I did one cd which I maybe should have done as vinyl and I released one cd-r as a gift at a party for the visitors. Tapes are for special (art) projects or when the type of music fits better on this format? which is of course a personal vision? <P>There is by the way a change I will re-release the Distel album on cd as I think more people should hear this amazing album? but this will be done then in a co-production with another label? and it will be a product on its own? most likely different from the vinyl release in some ways? I expect to know more on this soon? <P>- Can you tell us more about the events that you organize apart from your label activity (exhibitions, concerts, etc.)? <P>In the past I organized more regular nights like the Hex parties? but I got fed up with this? to me it became more of the same every night and I wanted to create more freedom for a different kind of events. So I experimented with different nights at different locations? most of them being one time concepts? it varied from live performances at openings of exhibitions to a night at a theatre with the program following that of a theatre night out to a concert at the kitchen of avant-garde fashion store XXX of my friends in Berlin?  <P>So since 2008 I organize about two nights each year? often one of them in co-productions with another organizer or organization? sometimes in Holland and sometimes somewhere else? For 2014 I am currently planning an Enfant Terrible /  Gooiland Elektro night in Holland in April and a performance night at XXX in Berlin in June? and possibly later on a Vrystaete event? but the ideas for this need to take shape first?  <P>- How do you feel like for this 10th anniversary, and how do you intend to celebrate it? <P>I like to put some attention to it as I am proud of doing this for 10 years in the way I have done it? 10 years of true independence and 10 years of cultural activism? as I like to see it? so there is the ?I Am Enfant Terrible? compilation which I put together for this occasion? but things need to move on? so I focus on the future for the rest? with new events? a new label (Vrystaete) and always other new ideas and plans which I will try to realize? and with now a tradition of my own (as 10 years might be called a tradition on its own in my opinion) and a focus on the future I try to live the now? celebrate what has been realized but try to catch the energy of the moment and simply have fun producing nice records and enjoying good music and working with nice people? just as it started? <P>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1399924020;}i:4;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4308539177101683596.post-6152616658991589144";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 21:03:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:92:"Enfant TerribleFormer Descentgood cop / naughty copgooiland elektropopsimonovaRude66sololust";s:5:"title";s:82:"Saturday 5th of April: Enfant Terrible / Gooiland Elektro night at Worm, Rotterdam";s:11:"description";s:378:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBaChk0WSis/UydgD7dFxkI/AAAAAAAAAd8/j5AAZ0nfYtI/s1600/Gooiland+Flyergoedek.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBaChk0WSis/UydgD7dFxkI/AAAAAAAAAd8/j5AAZ0nfYtI/s400/Gooiland+Flyergoedek.jpg" /></a></div>";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://terrible-music.blogspot.com/2014/03/saturday-5th-of-april-enfant-terrible.html";s:6:"author";s:24:"noreply@blogger.com (ET)";s:7:"summary";s:378:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBaChk0WSis/UydgD7dFxkI/AAAAAAAAAd8/j5AAZ0nfYtI/s1600/Gooiland+Flyergoedek.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBaChk0WSis/UydgD7dFxkI/AAAAAAAAAd8/j5AAZ0nfYtI/s400/Gooiland+Flyergoedek.jpg" /></a></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1394830980;}i:5;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4308539177101683596.post-7466116026537834880";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 21:47:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:52:"folkloreKavallo-finiedowierzaniepsychedelicVrystaete";s:5:"title";s:21:"label news: Vrystaete";s:11:"description";s:1913:"A new label is born: Vrystaete.

Released on Phantasma Disques it has little to do with witch house... a style the label is best known for... 'Hearing Colors' sounds very indie... the sound is mellow and soothing most of the time... dreamy stuff with warm female vocals... but occasionally the sound gets a little colder... and some moments it is like listening to a relaxed version of Crystal Castles... including clear rhythms and some 8 bit noises and sounds... here is one of the highlights of the album... and one of the most moody pieces 'Triduum'... <P><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/57692915?color=ff42e6" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/57692915">Skint Eastwood - Triduum (Three Days Of Darkness)</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/awesomer">EYEDRESS</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><P>From the same label comes the new Mater Suspiria Vision album...

Violence delivers new wave inspired synth pop with a neo-romantic touch and italo disco elements... and maybe not all songs are equally strong but when at their best Violence shows they are a band with lots of potential for the future... as shows "Dernier Cri"... <P><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80372119&show_artwork=true"></iframe><P>More harder to define is the album 'Hearing Colors' by Eyesdress and Skint Eastwood... on the other hand the title says it all... this album serves you a wide spectrum of sounds and influences of various styles... still the album is a excellent cohorent piece. Released on Phantasma Disques it has little to do with witch house... a style the label is best known for... 'Hearing Colors' sounds very indie... the sound is mellow and soothing most of the time... dreamy stuff with warm female vocals... but occasionally the sound gets a little colder... and some moments it is like listening to a relaxed version of Crystal Castles... including clear rhythms and some 8 bit noises and sounds... here is one of the highlights of the album... and one of the most moody pieces 'Triduum'... <P><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/57692915?color=ff42e6" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/57692915">Skint Eastwood - Triduum (Three Days Of Darkness)</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/awesomer">EYEDRESS</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><P>From the same label comes the new Mater Suspiria Vision album... I liked some of the older stuff but not all as it had the tendency to be very minimal... like repetitive in a not good way... so to speak... BUT 'Serenity' is a very solid album with good songs and a nice flow througout the record... some rhythmic pieces and some more droney noise pieces which pull you inside... or down under to be precise... this one is for the fans of the darker side of synth music... this is stuff for black magic rites and other occult gatherings... here is one piece of the record...<P><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/57756694" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/57756694">MATER SUSPIRIA VISION - SERENITY [Official Video - Directed by Cosmotropia de Xam, 2013]</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/matersuspiriavision">Mater Suspiria Vision</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><P>All of the records above are for sale in the Enfant Terrible webshop <a href="http://www.enfant-terrible.nl/mailorder%20CENTRAL.htm">here...</a>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1363530300;}i:18;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4308539177101683596.post-4458808759789213982";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 03 Mar 2013 17:22:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:68:"angst popdeath discoDistelindustrialMarcus Moonenminimal electronics";s:5:"title";s:30:"Distel - hxxx (official video)";s:11:"description";s:581:"Here is the official video for the track "hxxx"by Distel... taken from the upcoming album "puur"... expected in April... <P><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/J5WXRNvZE1g?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/J5WXRNvZE1g?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://terrible-music.blogspot.com/2013/03/distel-hxxx-official-video.html";s:6:"author";s:24:"noreply@blogger.com (ET)";s:7:"summary";s:581:"Here is the official video for the track "hxxx"by Distel... taken from the upcoming album "puur"... expected in April... <P><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/J5WXRNvZE1g?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/J5WXRNvZE1g?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1362331320;}i:19;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4308539177101683596.post-7616020009009773046";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 15:19:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:69:"arthouse filmBerlinEdwin BrienenEnfant TerribleExploitationsoundtrack";s:5:"title";s:30:"Exploitation: official trailer";s:11:"description";s:760:"Below is the trailer for Exploitation the latest film by Edwin Brienen.

What is the best memory when it comes to producing music, performing live, releasing music? <P>A: Yes, I did my first Bunker LP in '93 I think..but i released some things before that, my first one was a collaboration as 'Voice Of The Mute' on Dirk Ivens' Body Records in 1990. Some of my best memories were linked to places and people I looked up to. The first time I heard my own music on VPRO radio, that I used to listen to all the time myself. The first time I played in a place like Paradiso, on the same stage that my favourite bands had also been on. Finding out that John Peel not only played my records, but knew who I was when I met him.. Some of the best memories in the studio came from trying new things.. first time I used analogue tape to record, rather than DAT for instance. But also, and this is only in hindsight, that I was part of something pretty special that we accomplished with the whole Den Haag acid scene. <P><P>Q: And, what is the worst experience when it comes to the music industry? <P>A: Being ripped off, like many artists.. finding your name on compilations that you never knew about, and never got any money for. My first experience with a real label was an offshoot of Crammed Discs, and it was the standard rockband story: treated like gods by the A&R guy, big fight between band members during recording, issues with the contract, and never paid properly. Luckily after this I started working with Bunker, and these issues never showed up again in this form. <P><P>Q: The transition from acid to electro orientated sound? how did this evolve? Was it driven by the development of your artistic skills, or new machines you bought or were you just fed up with the acid sound and you ended up with electro after some experimentation? <P>A: It was a combination, but mainly being fed up with the acid scene, which by then was mostly people completely out of their mind on whatever drugs they were taking (we're talking hard stuff, not just some weed).. the whole thing just sort of imploded and at the same time I kind of felt I'd said it all with the 'sewer sound' of the early Bunker records. I tried drum & bass for a bit (the industrial kind) but decided that wasn't my way of working, only cutting up samples.  So I kind of went back to my musical roots, which is EBM/electro/wave. By coincidence, several people did this same thing and it all sort of fell into place when the 'new' Bunker 3000 started and people like I-f, but also Underground Resistance in Detroit, went through a similar process. <P><P>Q: You are big fan of (analogue) synths. Was this always the case? Or is this just what you grew up with? What is special about these machines for you? <P>A: It's what I grew up with, and back then it was only because the stuff was cheap because everybody wanted digital machines. It's not just the synths though, analogue is almost a way of life. An analogue synth is a musical instrument, a digital synth is an emulation of a musical instrument, basically a computer. What appeals to me in the synths are their unpredictability, which translates into their sound and of course the interface, with one knob for one function.  But for me also the whole analogue recording process is preferable over digital. I love the full sound of vintage mixers and tape recorders. I'm a big believer in not going with a new technology unless it's better than the old one. So many people have thrown away all their old stuff just to 'go with the times' and find out later that it sucks.. I've never been convinced that digital recording is better than analogue, or for that matter than cd's and mp3's are better than vinyl, so I stick to the old technologies until something better comes along.  <P>Digital technology has its place when it can do stuff that analogue technology can't do, I use it a lot myself. But unfortunately it's mostly used to emulate vintage analogue gear, and of course the originals are always better than their digital clones. <P><P>Q: Many people I guess think Rude66 is you? but is Shaunna is an essential part of Rude66, not? <P>A: Yes, she is. I started as Rude 66 by myself, initially accompanied live by a scratch dj (who was also the car driver) but Shaunna slowly got involved in lyrics. About 10 years ago I asked her to sing live during gigs, and ever since then, she's part of the team. We share a preference for songs about the dark side of things, and often her lyrics compliment a track I made perfectly. I do the music and we either do lyrics together or she writes them and sings them, and a lot of times she improvises with them when we play live. <P><P><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GbFvocof1Rc/ULZrwa5PLdI/AAAAAAAAAV8/vpT1IACQzN8/s1600/Rude66_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="149" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GbFvocof1Rc/ULZrwa5PLdI/AAAAAAAAAV8/vpT1IACQzN8/s320/Rude66_2.jpg" /></a></div><P><P>Q: You are linked to Bunker in many ways. Even though your sound is maybe today not really representative of the label output. How do you look upon this? Are you in a way the artistic conscience, representing the outer edges of the sound spectrum of Bunker? <P>A: I'd like to say that I am, though I don't know if anyone would agree with me..;-) It is true though that Bunker boss Guy Tevares and me have been involved together in music for close to 30 years now, and we both come from the punk/DIY side of things which is what still appeals to me in the whole 'west coast scene'.  <P>A lot of the other artists come from different backgrounds and quite a few of them were even too young to have lived through the whole first part of Bunker. I guess people like me and of course Guy and Jan (who were Unit Moebius) are the musically active survivors of that scene today, and still share that combination of the DIY ethics of the hardcore punk scene combined with the love of both electronic dance music and avant-garde electronics. <P><P>Q: You were involved with the Vynalogica. Were you ever involved in other labels /  releasing music yourself? <P>A: I had a label called Speedster in about '95 or '96, where I released an EP from myself. When these came back from the pressing plant, our distributor announced he stopped, leaving me with a pile of 300 records (and also problems for a lot of other labels like Bunker, Reference, etc). In the end, I sold most through I-F's Hotmix mailorder and a few years ago, I found 2 more boxes which by then sold pretty fast. I'm thinking about doing some tape-only releases again, just for the fun of it, but I prefer to let other people deal with the process of releasing and selling records.. <P><P>Q: Since years you also work a lot with Crème Organization. Like Bunker they are from Holland. You prefer to work with Dutch labels / people when it comes to releasing music? Or is this more coincidence? <P>I prefer to work with people from our own scene, who are almost all Dutch, though I have done stuff for foreign labels linked to us like MinimalRome and others. The advantage is that I've known these guys for years and that they generally can be trusted, also with the financial part of things. I'm a big believer in supporting each other as a way to build up a scene. We have distributors and shops like Clone and Godspill, the radio like Intergalactic FM, artists and labels, and in the end we all need and support each other. Its probably also the reason the whole scene still exists after so many years! <P><P>Q: What are you current activities / plans? Any new sounds we can expect? Moving away from the electro sound maybe? <P>A: I've moved into the field of mastering for other labels which is taking quite a bit of my time and is a lot of fun to do. As for my own music, I've noticed a shift away from electro and more into wave-ish territory on one hand, and back to acid on the other hand. It's not a deliberate choice, but it just sort of happens that way. The acid tracks are definitely slower and darker than before, something I did first on the Stalingrad compilation LP on Bunker and now on the new Jagdstaffel 66 EP, trying to merge the early acid sound with the dark electronics of bands like Coil or Skinny Puppy.  <P>I'm also working on a 'real band' project, where the starting point is 80's guitar noise and shoegaze music (my other musical love apart from electronics) which will see some finished material hopefully this year. <P><P><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WWGwqumfsbc/ULZwCL_csWI/AAAAAAAAAWo/gNb_Z_puEU8/s1600/Rude66_3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="213" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WWGwqumfsbc/ULZwCL_csWI/AAAAAAAAAWo/gNb_Z_puEU8/s320/Rude66_3.jpg" /></a></div>  ";s:4:"link";s:64:"http://terrible-music.blogspot.com/2012/11/interview-rude66.html";s:6:"author";s:24:"noreply@blogger.com (ET)";s:7:"summary";s:9463:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3RT6RhjVg00/ULZvOyToNaI/AAAAAAAAAWc/JasV64VTixA/s1600/Rude66_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="230" width="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3RT6RhjVg00/ULZvOyToNaI/AAAAAAAAAWc/JasV64VTixA/s320/Rude66_1.jpg" /></a></div><P><P>Below is an interview with Rude66... who does hopefully does not need any introduction... <P>Q: It is almost 25 years now you are active as a musician and about 20 years as Rude66, not?

In the late 70's/early 80's this was given a new twist again fitting the changed world... I would claim that 80's new wave is nothing more as dark version of the neo-romantic movement of the 60's...  <p>In new wave music psychedelic touches or even psychedelic music as such is not difficult to find. 'The Top' by The Cure is filled with references to psychedelic music. The Fields Of The Nephilim played psychedelic rock... but very dark... resulting into something more ritual therefor. The music by The Legendary Pink Dots and Edward Ka-Spel is as psychedelic as it gets. Just to name a few examples... and let's not forget some of the minimal electronics outfits... like Monoton for example... who where on the more experimental side. They often hinted to Minimal Music... which is also a 60's thing...  <p>And... now in this endless 80's revival it is also there... Moon Duo are somewhere in between psychedelic music and Suicide related synth punk. Bronze is like a post-punk outfit spiced up with acid rock. And there is now this debut album by Group Rhoda... which is really close to 60's music... to be more clear... it sounds like The Great Society equipped with 80's instruments like a drum machine and synths... and a voice like that of Grace Slick... coming very close at least and singing in a typical 60's style...  <p>So, no this is not daring new adventurous music... but what is today? Group Rhoda delivers a sound I have been listening to for many years but still untill now I have never heard this typical 60's sound done with 80's musical equipment... and done so well... so yes I love it!! <p>Even though this is yet another product of our age of recycling I prefer this way above all the cheap re-issues of so called lost gems, cult bands and classic albums from the 80's. Same goes for all these contemporary copycat bands who just sound like it is 1982 all over again... no, I will just put on this Group Rhoda album again and again... as compared to all of that this is daring new adventurous music! <p>Here is one track from the album... <p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Fp4UjodNIx8?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Fp4UjodNIx8?version=3&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://terrible-music.blogspot.com/2012/11/review-group-rhoda-out-of-time-out-of.html";s:6:"author";s:24:"noreply@blogger.com (ET)";s:7:"summary";s:3496:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sch3hZxAsWw/UJl4uLkmISI/AAAAAAAAAVc/hoMpqqesHGs/s1600/grouprhoda_cvr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear:left; float:left;margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="250" width="248" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sch3hZxAsWw/UJl4uLkmISI/AAAAAAAAAVc/hoMpqqesHGs/s320/grouprhoda_cvr.jpg" /></a></div><p>I have always looked at 80's new wave music and subculture as a replay of 60's neo-romanticism... the 60's where the first replay of the Romantic era... which was in a way the first youth subculture in Western Society. <p>The 60's pre-hippie subcultures starting with The Beat Generation (even though the surfer subculture was also an early youth subculture which even adopted LSD) transformed the central idea's of the 19th century movement centered around the anti-rational and the emphasis on the subjective experience into the context of the new era. In the late 70's/early 80's this was given a new twist again fitting the changed world... I would claim that 80's new wave is nothing more as dark version of the neo-romantic movement of the 60's...  <p>In new wave music psychedelic touches or even psychedelic music as such is not difficult to find. 'The Top' by The Cure is filled with references to psychedelic music. The Fields Of The Nephilim played psychedelic rock... but very dark... resulting into something more ritual therefor. The music by The Legendary Pink Dots and Edward Ka-Spel is as psychedelic as it gets. Just to name a few examples... and let's not forget some of the minimal electronics outfits... like Monoton for example... who where on the more experimental side. They often hinted to Minimal Music... which is also a 60's thing...  <p>And... now in this endless 80's revival it is also there... Moon Duo are somewhere in between psychedelic music and Suicide related synth punk. Bronze is like a post-punk outfit spiced up with acid rock. And there is now this debut album by Group Rhoda... which is really close to 60's music... to be more clear... it sounds like The Great Society equipped with 80's instruments like a drum machine and synths... and a voice like that of Grace Slick... coming very close at least and singing in a typical 60's style...  <p>So, no this is not daring new adventurous music... but what is today?
