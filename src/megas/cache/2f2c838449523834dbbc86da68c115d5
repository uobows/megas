The suggestion was not to, for example, continue spending $10,000 on five shows, but rather spend $10,000 on four shows (or three or two), increasing the budget per show and thus, according to the speakers, increasing the excellence of the artistic product.<br /><br />With further thought, I see two problems with this advice.<br /><br />First, the advice of Remington and McGuirk was based in what is, in my opinion, false logic: Funding equates to excellence of artistic product. In other words: if more funding, then better art; less funding, worse art. I think we can all agree that we have all, on more than one occasion, seen quite the opposite: small budget projects succeeding because of creative solutions to having less and big budget projects failing because of uninspired excesses from having more. That is not to say there is not excellence being produced with more (or crap with less), only that it is impossible to support the claim that that funding is the sole catalyst of artistic excellence.<br /><br />Second, the advice of Remington and McGuirk was based on math that did not account for the less-than-flexible variable of earned income.<br /><br />Let us say that we run a theatre company and our budget for our 2010-11 season of five productions was $10,000 (we?ll roll the operational budget into the production to keep this simple). For the sake of easy math, let us divide our budget equally among the productions: $2,000 per production. That?s all we had to spend on each show.<br /><br />Of course, we are fiscally responsible managers in our hypothetical example and our expenses are based not only on what it would take to accomplish our artistic vision but also our pragmatic revenue expectations. We don?t think running up a cumulative deficit year after year is very healthy, so we aim to earn at least $10,000 (or $2,000 a production) to balance the books.<br /><br />Being a nonprofit performing arts organization, we tend to only earn about 50% of our income from ticket sales. We earn the remainder from donations and grants. So, let?s say we are able to recoup the costs of each $2,000 productions with $1,000 in ticket sales and $1,000 in contributions, like this:<br /><br />$1,000 earned + $1,000 contributed = $2,000 x 5 = $10,000 total season revenue<br /><br />Aren?t our auditors happy?<br /><br />However, let?s say we were inspired by the advice given by Remington and McGuirk at the 2011 TBA Conference! If we decided to ?focus on excellence? by reducing the number of productions (in this case, we?ll say from five to two) while keeping our budget flat, as was suggested by Remington and McGuirk, then we?d expect to get a model like this in 2011-12:<br /><br />$2,500 earned + $2,500 contributed = $5,000 x 2 = $10,000 total season revenue<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />If you are or have ever been responsible for ticket sale income, you are probably hyperventilating. You?ve been squeezing blood from of a stone for years with your pathetic marketing budget just to sell $1,000 worth of tickets to each show. Now, you?re expected increase income by 150%?! In one year?! And this expectation comes with fewer chances to recoup losses (you only have two productions to earn your budgeted income) and a just slightly less-than-pathetic marketing budget. But wait, wait, you have capital-E Excellence on your side!<br /><br />Edgar Allen Poe once said: ?There are few cases in which mere popularity should be considered a proper test of merit.? A marketer knows this. He or she knows that merit is not enough fuel sales of a product. More often than not, sales of a product are related to consumer behavior, brand or product reputation, customer and business networks, price points, persuasiveness of messaging, accessibility to bandwidth (and so much more) rather than just excellence alone. In other words, our hypothetical theatre company will be lucky to pull this off in 2011-12:<br /><br />$1,500 earned (a miraculous 50% increase from 2010-11) + $2,500 contributed = $4,000 x 2 = $8,000 total season revenue<br /><br />Oh crap, we kept our spending flat at $10,000 and now we have a $2,000 deficit. But Remington and McGuirk's advice, to spend the same on fewer shows, in fact puts the burden of funding our artistic product on their organizations?the very organizations that they say are unable to increase funding to us. In the example above, contributed income would have to increase 40% (now the folks in charge of development are hyperventilating) to break even.<br /><br />Does consolidating resources in fewer shows make for better shows? Can it even be done? Do you know of any examples to support this advice? Let me know in the comment section below.

I?m sure it?s the same in every field, but since theatre is where my managerial experience lies, I?m going to speak specifically to that.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Here?s what I?ve learned are the Absolute Core Truths of Theatre Personnel Management. These are probably all already printed in some management book, so feel free to tell me if I?m boring you by repeating something you had to read in business school, and I?ll go back to the ranting and inappropriate jokes you?ve come to expect from me. Here?s what I learned in the School of Hard Knocks?.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">1. You don?t buy loyalty with a paycheck. You earn it by treating people with respect.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This doesn?t mean complimenting their work. ?Great job!? or ?You?re so good at this? only go so far with your staff if you treat their opinions dismissively and if you routinely override their expertise. Your marketing director, your lighting designer, and your box office manager all know more about their areas than you do. It?s their job to know more about it than you do. Listen to their opinions. Allow them to disagree with you. Take their opinions very, very seriously, because if they?re disagreeing with you about their area of expertise, it?s almost certain that they?re right and you?re wrong. Respect their knowledge and experience, and they will reward you in 100 ways.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">2. Give your staff ownership of the company and the work.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Allow your staff the freedom to make decisions. Don?t interfere with their decisions or their processes unless absolutely necessary. Does the set design violate fire code? Necessary. Does the rehearsal schedule violate the terms of your AEA contract? Necessary. Did no one tell the director the script is a comedy? Necessary. Do you think the backdrop should be light green instead of blue? Unnecessary. Do you think the sound designer should use ?Bittersweet Symphony? instead of Sigur Ros? Unnecessary. Obviously you should make your opinions known, but putting your foot down and requiring a designer, development director, or stage manager to make unnecessary changes to their products or to their processes creates disgruntled, unhappy, underappreciated staff. Give your opinion or guidance, and back off unless the matter truly requires intervention. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">3. Wear your authority with ease.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nothing says ?I?m insecure in positions of authority? like someone yelling at staff or refusing to allow staff to voice their opinions. A strong leader engages staff as equals, respecting their expertise. This doesn?t mean you should cede authority. Allowing your staff to make their own decisions and create their own processes doesn?t result in an authority drain. Step in when it?s necessary to step in. Put your foot down, respectfully, when it?s important. But have the strength to recognize when it?s important and when it?s not. And when mistakes happen or disaster strikes?because it will, trust me?blaming staff or yelling at people or otherwise losing your cool is the worst thing you can do.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">4. Admit when you?re wrong.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Because they all already know it. Bluffing makes you look foolish.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">5. Don?t be afraid to make the hard decisions.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Sometimes people need to be let go. This is the hardest thing for me personally and something I?ve bitched out on doing a number of times, hoping for the best. Learn from my mistakes. Be gentle, be respectful, but get rid of the people who can?t do their jobs. Again, everyone else already knows, and they?re sick of covering for that person. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">6. Do whatever you have to do to keep your tech people happy.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">While all theatre personnel are equally important, too often techs get treated poorly, blamed for mishaps, and left out of the glory. Happy techs make a show sparkle with awesomeness, like a magical lighting and sound unicorn flew over the theatre. Happy techs can build a gorgeous set out of popsicle sticks and coffee filters. Happy techs call 427 cues without breaking a sweat. Unappreciated, yelled-at techs will still do their jobs perfectly?they?re professionals?but they will withhold the awesome and take someone else?s gig next time around. Or worse?continue taking your gigs and talk shit about you in the community.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Relax</span>. It?s theatre.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This isn?t brain surgery. No one will die if the director casts Actor X instead of the actor you liked best at callbacks. No catastrophe will ensue if your lighting designer went with a different gobo. It?s not fuckpocalypse if your marketing director thought one show was on the weak side. Breathe. Creating art is about both process and product. Don?t beat your process to death with your image of the perfect product. Nothing is going to be perfect, but it?s within your power to make it awesome.</div>";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://blog.theatrebayarea.org/2011/05/absolute-core-truths-of-theatre.html";s:6:"author";s:29:"noreply@blogger.com (Melissa)";s:7:"summary";s:6950:"<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">This special guest post was written by Impact Theatre artistic director Melissa Hillman.

Wear your authority with ease.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nothing says ?I?m insecure in positions of authority? like someone yelling at staff or refusing to allow staff to voice their opinions. A strong leader engages staff as equals, respecting their expertise. This doesn?t mean you should cede authority. Allowing your staff to make their own decisions and create their own processes doesn?t result in an authority drain. Step in when it?s necessary to step in. Put your foot down, respectfully, when it?s important. But have the strength to recognize when it?s important and when it?s not. And when mistakes happen or disaster strikes?because it will, trust me?blaming staff or yelling at people or otherwise losing your cool is the worst thing you can do.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">4. Admit when you?re wrong.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Because they all already know it. Bluffing makes you look foolish.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">5. Don?t be afraid to make the hard decisions.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Sometimes people need to be let go. This is the hardest thing for me personally and something I?ve bitched out on doing a number of times, hoping for the best. Learn from my mistakes. Be gentle, be respectful, but get rid of the people who can?t do their jobs. Again, everyone else already knows, and they?re sick of covering for that person. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">6. Do whatever you have to do to keep your tech people happy.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">While all theatre personnel are equally important, too often techs get treated poorly, blamed for mishaps, and left out of the glory. Happy techs make a show sparkle with awesomeness, like a magical lighting and sound unicorn flew over the theatre. Happy techs can build a gorgeous set out of popsicle sticks and coffee filters. Happy techs call 427 cues without breaking a sweat. Unappreciated, yelled-at techs will still do their jobs perfectly?they?re professionals?but they will withhold the awesome and take someone else?s gig next time around. Or worse?continue taking your gigs and talk shit about you in the community.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Relax</span>. It?s theatre.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This isn?t brain surgery. No one will die if the director casts Actor X instead of the actor you liked best at callbacks. No catastrophe will ensue if your lighting designer went with a different gobo. It?s not fuckpocalypse if your marketing director thought one show was on the weak side. Breathe. Creating art is about both process and product. Don?t beat your process to death with your image of the perfect product. Nothing is going to be perfect, but it?s within your power to make it awesome.</div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1304982060;}i:3;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1622774019969581060.post-1553150603680165409";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 23:15:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:79:"businessKennedy Centermichael kaisermillennialsrants and ravesstate of the arts";s:5:"title";s:25:"In Defense of Millennials";s:11:"description";s:7667:"<span style="font-style: italic;">This special guest post was written by Impact Theatre artistic director Melissa Hillman.

written by</span></i><i style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> Pamela Rosen, a Silicon Valley-based business writer who moonlights in the theatre as an actor, director, and acting coach.</span></i></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As we begin to emerge from the ?great recession,? Bay Area theatre has a vastly different landscape than it did during the boom years. Well-established, respected companies have disappeared ?victims, it would seem, of the terrible economy. Yet, there are plenty of theatre companies in the Bay Area that flourished during the recession. It makes me wonder: how did the successful ones do it? What caused others with solid audience bases to fail? And most importantly, what can struggling theatres do now to shore up their futures?</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal" style=""><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Keeping it real in good times<span style="">               </span></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When times are good, it?s easy for theatre companies to breathe easy and focus only on producing great shows. But so many companies plan from year to year and not for the future. When ticket sales are good enough to keep a company afloat, who wants to go out and raise money? It?s hard to convince a Board of Directors to work even harder to raise cash when money is flowing in from the box office.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In 2008, our economy fell apart quickly, and not many even came close to predicting how severe the recession would be. Many theatre companies reacted by putting on traditionally crowd-pleasing shows they thought would draw big audiences. But splashy, family-oriented productions of <i style="">Oklahoma </i>and <i style="">Annie</i> couldn?t bring in the family if the tickets were priced out of the family?s budget. Incomes fell in 2008?but production costs didn?t. Without a long-term plan or a contingency in place, companies were simply not agile enough to adjust budgets or ticket prices. </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One producer at the now-defunct Alameda Civic Light Opera (ACLO) explains, ?We looked out into the audience during <i style="">Annie</i> and saw half-filled houses. Meanwhile, families were walking away from the box office after seeing the ticket prices, carrying crying little girls. It?s not like the audience wasn?t there, but the shows weren?t affordable anymore.? </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">With dramatic scenes like that, it?s unlikely ACLO would be have been able to recoup their losses with last-minute fundraising. The window of opportunity had closed. The board was too busy trying to pay the bills and keep the doors open and couldn?t take on the additional, now more difficult task of fundraising.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">?The loss of ACLO is a huge void in the community,? says ACLO director Cary Litchford. ?I miss the company terribly and they had a lot of heart and soul.? </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Building Relationships and Raising Funds</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Theatre companies fare much better if they have long-term 3-5 year plans and Boards of Directors with members who understand that their individual and group responsibility is first and foremost fundraising and community outreach. The Willows Theatre Company in Concord closed its doors in November of 2009 and moved operations to its smaller cabaret house in Martinez, but is now roaring back. How did they manage it? With the company?s closure, the surrounding businesses and restaurants also suffered a drop in business. The Willows had developed such close relationships with those businesses that the theatre had become indispensible. An outcry from those businesses, The Willows? key stakeholders, enabled The Willows to reorganize and return. Because The Willows had been making money putting on smaller, lower cost shows during the depths of the recession, they were ready to move back in and operate again in two venues, each feeding the other. Today, they have a new artistic director and a solid five-year plan.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One for the money, two for the show</span></b></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">An upstart non-profit company in <span class="yshortcuts">San Leandro</span>, Curtain Call Performing Arts, arose as a direct result of the recession, with a goal to provide affordable theatre to everyone regardless of the state of the economy. To do this, the Board created a unique charter: raise the all the funds to mount a show before a production begins, then charge no more than $12 a ticket. They?ve mounted three productions this way, and even offered $1 tickets to children with a paid adult during a specified matinee.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Though this method currently makes it impossible to schedule production dates in much in advance, it?s an interesting model. The board is forced to continually innovate with <span class="yshortcuts">creative fund raising</span> and volunteer coordination. They?ve come up with clever ideas. ?Our concert choir, <span class="yshortcuts">Cantare</span>, is one hundred percent volunteer operated,? says founding member Andrea Gorham. ?Its sole purpose is to raise funds. CCPA partners with other nonprofit art groups in San Leandro to put on <span class="yshortcuts">benefit concerts</span> featuring Cantare.? Curtain Call partners with other arts organizations to share the profits and the audience. They?ve built an impressive audience base, and, through the choir, a large pool of volunteers. </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Though it?s not a model that many companies will likely embrace, other companies could take a page from Curtain Call?s book. They might also learn a lesson from The Willows, which stayed in business in the middle of a recession by mounting smaller, less expensive productions and maintaining strong relationships with external stakeholders who revived The Willows' mainstage.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">All over the Bay Area, theatre companies are still struggling. Those with a long term plan, an understanding that the purpose of a board of directors is to raise money and develop external relationships, that also have the flexibility to scale productions costs to swing with a volatile economy, will flourish. We?re not out of this yet. For some companies, it?s too late. But there?s still a chance for others to mobilize and heed the lessons <a name="_GoBack"></a>of the last three years. What steps has your company taken to weather the economic downturn?</span></p>";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://blog.theatrebayarea.org/2011/04/whats-theatre-company-to-do-when.html";s:6:"author";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Pamela

written by</span></i><i style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> Pamela Rosen, a Silicon Valley-based business writer who moonlights in the theatre as an actor, director, and acting coach.</span></i></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As we begin to emerge from the ?great recession,? Bay Area theatre has a vastly different landscape than it did during the boom years. Well-established, respected companies have disappeared ?victims, it would seem, of the terrible economy. Yet, there are plenty of theatre companies in the Bay Area that flourished during the recession. It makes me wonder: how did the successful ones do it? What caused others with solid audience bases to fail? And most importantly, what can struggling theatres do now to shore up their futures?</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal" style=""><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Keeping it real in good times<span style="">               </span></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When times are good, it?s easy for theatre companies to breathe easy and focus only on producing great shows. But so many companies plan from year to year and not for the future. When ticket sales are good enough to keep a company afloat, who wants to go out and raise money? It?s hard to convince a Board of Directors to work even harder to raise cash when money is flowing in from the box office.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In 2008, our economy fell apart quickly, and not many even came close to predicting how severe the recession would be. Many theatre companies reacted by putting on traditionally crowd-pleasing shows they thought would draw big audiences. But splashy, family-oriented productions of <i style="">Oklahoma </i>and <i style="">Annie</i> couldn?t bring in the family if the tickets were priced out of the family?s budget. Incomes fell in 2008?but production costs didn?t. Without a long-term plan or a contingency in place, companies were simply not agile enough to adjust budgets or ticket prices. </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One producer at the now-defunct Alameda Civic Light Opera (ACLO) explains, ?We looked out into the audience during <i style="">Annie</i> and saw half-filled houses. Meanwhile, families were walking away from the box office after seeing the ticket prices, carrying crying little girls. It?s not like the audience wasn?t there, but the shows weren?t affordable anymore.? </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">With dramatic scenes like that, it?s unlikely ACLO would be have been able to recoup their losses with last-minute fundraising. The window of opportunity had closed. The board was too busy trying to pay the bills and keep the doors open and couldn?t take on the additional, now more difficult task of fundraising.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">?The loss of ACLO is a huge void in the community,? says ACLO director Cary Litchford. ?I miss the company terribly and they had a lot of heart and soul.? </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Building Relationships and Raising Funds</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Theatre companies fare much better if they have long-term 3-5 year plans and Boards of Directors with members who understand that their individual and group responsibility is first and foremost fundraising and community outreach. The Willows Theatre Company in Concord closed its doors in November of 2009 and moved operations to its smaller cabaret house in Martinez, but is now roaring back. How did they manage it? With the company?s closure, the surrounding businesses and restaurants also suffered a drop in business. The Willows had developed such close relationships with those businesses that the theatre had become indispensible. An outcry from those businesses, The Willows? key stakeholders, enabled The Willows to reorganize and return. Because The Willows had been making money putting on smaller, lower cost shows during the depths of the recession, they were ready to move back in and operate again in two venues, each feeding the other. Today, they have a new artistic director and a solid five-year plan.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One for the money, two for the show</span></b></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">An upstart non-profit company in <span class="yshortcuts">San Leandro</span>, Curtain Call Performing Arts, arose as a direct result of the recession, with a goal to provide affordable theatre to everyone regardless of the state of the economy. To do this, the Board created a unique charter: raise the all the funds to mount a show before a production begins, then charge no more than $12 a ticket. They?ve mounted three productions this way, and even offered $1 tickets to children with a paid adult during a specified matinee.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Though this method currently makes it impossible to schedule production dates in much in advance, it?s an interesting model. The board is forced to continually innovate with <span class="yshortcuts">creative fund raising</span> and volunteer coordination. They?ve come up with clever ideas. ?Our concert choir, <span class="yshortcuts">Cantare</span>, is one hundred percent volunteer operated,? says founding member Andrea Gorham. ?Its sole purpose is to raise funds. CCPA partners with other nonprofit art groups in San Leandro to put on <span class="yshortcuts">benefit concerts</span> featuring Cantare.? Curtain Call partners with other arts organizations to share the profits and the audience. They?ve built an impressive audience base, and, through the choir, a large pool of volunteers. </span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Though it?s not a model that many companies will likely embrace, other companies could take a page from Curtain Call?s book. They might also learn a lesson from The Willows, which stayed in business in the middle of a recession by mounting smaller, less expensive productions and maintaining strong relationships with external stakeholders who revived The Willows' mainstage.</span></p>  <p class="yiv1807353593msonormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">All over the Bay Area, theatre companies are still struggling. Those with a long term plan, an understanding that the purpose of a board of directors is to raise money and develop external relationships, that also have the flexibility to scale productions costs to swing with a volatile economy, will flourish. We?re not out of this yet. For some companies, it?s too late. But there?s still a chance for others to mobilize and heed the lessons <a name="_GoBack"></a>of the last three years. What steps has your company taken to weather the economic downturn?</span></p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1302815220;}i:5;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1622774019969581060.post-2741451012060533952";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 07 Apr 2011

Learn more about Impact Theatre at </span><a style="FONT-STYLE: italic" href="http://www.impacttheatre.com/">http://www.impacttheatre.com/</a><br /><br />?How do you get so many young people into your theatre? How can <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">we </span>do that??</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I?ve been asked these questions over and over and over. And over. The real answer is: I?m not sure. All I can tell you is what we?ve done, how we?ve done it and what I think you can do to better your chances of attracting the 18-35 audience. Will it work for you? I don?t know. Did it work for us? Yes, indeed.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Bear in mind that you need to do all of these things, all at the same time. This isn?t a pick-and-choose situation.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>1. Do the kinds of plays young people want to see.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">I am astounded by the fact that some larger theatres seem to believe young people should *always* be willing to translate, and blame self-centeredness, lack of interest in culture, lack of education and general boorishness when the 18-40 crowd don?t turn out in droves for a production of <i>Dinner with Friends</i> or <i>Love Letters.</i> Yet these very same theatres won?t slot a new play by an emerging playwright for fear of their subscribers? reactions. They expect young people to translate, and heap condemnation upon them when they don?t, but they see older audience members? potential lack of interest as their due. (P.S. Believe me when I tell you that 65 is the new 35. Many older Bay Area theatergoers are more adventurous than you think. TRUST. Moving on.)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">While it?s always a good thing to have an active interest in the stories of people not in your age group (or ethnic group, or regional group, or religious group, etc), everyone longs to see their own stories, hopes, dreams, fears, realities and fantasies reflected in honest ways.<span style="font-size:+0;"> </span>Young people are no different. The key phrase here is ?in honest ways.? A play by an older playwright with roles for young actors may or may not speak honestly to your desired potential younger audience members. Some older writers write very well for younger characters. Many do not. Large numbers of young people are not going to spring for tickets to a show that portrays them as mindless, boorish assholes. Find plays that speak honestly about the lives of young people in some way.<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But how do I do that, Melissa? </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I?m so glad you asked.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There are over 400 theatre companies in the nine-<st1:place><st1:placetype>county</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> Area. We do more world premiere plays than almost any other region in the country?last I checked we ranked third. Yet it?s very common that staff from theatres who purport to want young audiences don?t come to world premiere productions at small theatre companies. How many emerging playwrights have you read this year? If the number is under 10, you?re slacking. Impact Theatre, my company, has produced a world premiere by, and/or entirely introduced to the Bay Area, these playwrights: Sheila Callaghan, Steve Yockey, Prince Gomolvilas, Enrique Urueta, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Liz Meriwether, Lauren Yee, Peter Sinn Nachtrieb, Joshua Conkel, Trevor Allen, Jon Tracy. This is a partial list?I stuck to people you?ve probably heard of. Most importantly, we?re a tiny dog on a very, very big block. There are a wagonload of companies doing precisely what we do. Find them. See their shows. Spy on the playwrights they use. Companies like mine are your R&amp;D department. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Find directors who can make classic plays relevant and interesting?because they are. There are directors all over the country who draw loads of younger audience members into theatres to see Shakespeare, and a bunch of them are directing at these aforementioned smaller theatres.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>2. Be realistic about your pricing.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">It?s always annoying to hear people say, ?But they?ll spend $60 on a concert ticket! Why won?t they spend $60 on theatre?? It?s like wondering why someone would drive all the way across country to be with her beloved but not drive just as long in the hope that she will meet a hot stranger in a bar. People drop bucks on concert tickets because they already know and love the artist and have every expectation of seeing a great show and having a great experience. Condemning those people for refusing to drop a similar amount of money on a show they may know little about that will, let?s be honest, likely bore them because it?s aimed entirely at someone else, is a bit much, yes? If you?re going to condemn the under-40 crowd for not dropping $60 on your play about middle-class, middle-aged white people and their midlife crises, you should also condemn Grandma because she?s not stocking her <st1:stockticker>DVD</st1:stockticker> collection with $60 of Robot Chicken.<br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So keep your ticket prices accessible. Some companies do an under-30 rate, which, quite frankly, I?m not wild about. That 30-40 crowd is young enough to need enticing into your theatre but old enough to be on the brink of having enough money to become donors and subscribers. You want them. They?re routinely ignored and that?s not going to pay off in the long run for your audience building. Make an under-40 rate if you must. Make some performances pay-what-you-will. Make your less attractive seating areas $20 for the first few weekends. Whatever you need to do, do it.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>3. Market to young people.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">If you?re not active on Facebook and Twitter, you need to be right now. Learn how to use these powerful tools properly. This isn?t a social media marketing post, so I?ll assume you can figure out where to get this info and move on. The blog on your website is going nowhere unless you?re pushing it with Facebook and Twitter, by the way. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Find ways to make your outreach to young people honest and, most importantly, unpretentious. One of the main things keeping young people out of the theatre is that they?re afraid they won?t fit in?they?ll feel awkward and out of place. As my friend?s dad was fond of saying, they?re afraid they?ll ?stand out like a sheep turd in a bowl of cream.? You want to make them as comfortable as possible. A big step towards that is to use your marketing to make them feel welcome. Not pretend welcome, as in, ?We want to sell you tickets,? but truly welcome, like ?Come over and play with us! We just got a new toy!? </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Theatre is not medicine. We don?t go because it?s good for us. We go because we think it?ll be awesome. Make sure you?re approaching your marketing properly. ?It?ll be awesome? + ?You?re totally welcome and will be comfortable? + ?We?re not stuffy and pretentious? will go a long way. Make sure you?re delivering those goods onsite as well. Nothing drives someone away from your company forever as efficiently as an undelivered promise.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">And that?s pretty much it.

Learn more about Impact Theatre at </span><a style="FONT-STYLE: italic" href="http://www.impacttheatre.com/">http://www.impacttheatre.com/</a><br /><br />?How do you get so many young people into your theatre? How can <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">we </span>do that??</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I?ve been asked these questions over and over and over. And over. The real answer is: I?m not sure. All I can tell you is what we?ve done, how we?ve done it and what I think you can do to better your chances of attracting the 18-35 audience. Will it work for you? I don?t know. Did it work for us? Yes, indeed.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Bear in mind that you need to do all of these things, all at the same time. This isn?t a pick-and-choose situation.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>1. Do the kinds of plays young people want to see.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">I am astounded by the fact that some larger theatres seem to believe young people should *always* be willing to translate, and blame self-centeredness, lack of interest in culture, lack of education and general boorishness when the 18-40 crowd don?t turn out in droves for a production of <i>Dinner with Friends</i> or <i>Love Letters.</i> Yet these very same theatres won?t slot a new play by an emerging playwright for fear of their subscribers? reactions. They expect young people to translate, and heap condemnation upon them when they don?t, but they see older audience members? potential lack of interest as their due. (P.S. Believe me when I tell you that 65 is the new 35. Many older Bay Area theatergoers are more adventurous than you think. TRUST. Moving on.)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">While it?s always a good thing to have an active interest in the stories of people not in your age group (or ethnic group, or regional group, or religious group, etc), everyone longs to see their own stories, hopes, dreams, fears, realities and fantasies reflected in honest ways.<span style="font-size:+0;"> </span>Young people are no different. The key phrase here is ?in honest ways.? A play by an older playwright with roles for young actors may or may not speak honestly to your desired potential younger audience members. Some older writers write very well for younger characters. Many do not. Large numbers of young people are not going to spring for tickets to a show that portrays them as mindless, boorish assholes. Find plays that speak honestly about the lives of young people in some way.<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But how do I do that, Melissa? </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I?m so glad you asked.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There are over 400 theatre companies in the nine-<st1:place><st1:placetype>county</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> Area. We do more world premiere plays than almost any other region in the country?last I checked we ranked third. Yet it?s very common that staff from theatres who purport to want young audiences don?t come to world premiere productions at small theatre companies. How many emerging playwrights have you read this year? If the number is under 10, you?re slacking. Impact Theatre, my company, has produced a world premiere by, and/or entirely introduced to the Bay Area, these playwrights: Sheila Callaghan, Steve Yockey, Prince Gomolvilas, Enrique Urueta, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Liz Meriwether, Lauren Yee, Peter Sinn Nachtrieb, Joshua Conkel, Trevor Allen, Jon Tracy. This is a partial list?I stuck to people you?ve probably heard of. Most importantly, we?re a tiny dog on a very, very big block. There are a wagonload of companies doing precisely what we do. Find them. See their shows. Spy on the playwrights they use. Companies like mine are your R&amp;D department. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Find directors who can make classic plays relevant and interesting?because they are. There are directors all over the country who draw loads of younger audience members into theatres to see Shakespeare, and a bunch of them are directing at these aforementioned smaller theatres.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>2. Be realistic about your pricing.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">It?s always annoying to hear people say, ?But they?ll spend $60 on a concert ticket! Why won?t they spend $60 on theatre?? It?s like wondering why someone would drive all the way across country to be with her beloved but not drive just as long in the hope that she will meet a hot stranger in a bar. People drop bucks on concert tickets because they already know and love the artist and have every expectation of seeing a great show and having a great experience. Condemning those people for refusing to drop a similar amount of money on a show they may know little about that will, let?s be honest, likely bore them because it?s aimed entirely at someone else, is a bit much, yes? If you?re going to condemn the under-40 crowd for not dropping $60 on your play about middle-class, middle-aged white people and their midlife crises, you should also condemn Grandma because she?s not stocking her <st1:stockticker>DVD</st1:stockticker> collection with $60 of Robot Chicken.<br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So keep your ticket prices accessible. Some companies do an under-30 rate, which, quite frankly, I?m not wild about. That 30-40 crowd is young enough to need enticing into your theatre but old enough to be on the brink of having enough money to become donors and subscribers. You want them. They?re routinely ignored and that?s not going to pay off in the long run for your audience building. Make an under-40 rate if you must. Make some performances pay-what-you-will. Make your less attractive seating areas $20 for the first few weekends. Whatever you need to do, do it.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><strong>3. Market to young people.</strong></div><div class="MsoNormal">If you?re not active on Facebook and Twitter, you need to be right now. Learn how to use these powerful tools properly. This isn?t a social media marketing post, so I?ll assume you can figure out where to get this info and move on. The blog on your website is going nowhere unless you?re pushing it with Facebook and Twitter, by the way. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Find ways to make your outreach to young people honest and, most importantly, unpretentious. One of the main things keeping young people out of the theatre is that they?re afraid they won?t fit in?they?ll feel awkward and out of place. As my friend?s dad was fond of saying, they?re afraid they?ll ?stand out like a sheep turd in a bowl of cream.? You want to make them as comfortable as possible. A big step towards that is to use your marketing to make them feel welcome. Not pretend welcome, as in, ?We want to sell you tickets,? but truly welcome, like ?Come over and play with us!

Make sure you?re delivering those goods onsite as well.

This is what I believe has worked for us over the past 15 years. I hope it?s successful for you as well. We all need to work together to build audiences for our future as an artistic community. There?s not a single one of us that exists on an island.

EMC program approval is granted in theatres where there is a minimum equity ratio and an equity stage manager required, along with other criteria. The EMC program is set up to be a mentorship program if there are not enough equity members to mentor an EMC, so having Equity Actors and stage managers at the theatre is essential.  </span></p>  <p style="font-family: arial;" class="MsoNoSpacing">      </p>  <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;" class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:100%;">What are the time frames suggested for approval for the various contracts?</span></p>  <p style="font-family: arial;" class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:100%;">Deadlines are listed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=122261744639&amp;topic=19121">here</a> and in the Bay Area Equity Contract Comparison.

Aside from ACT's upcoming production of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tales of the City </span>and last year's showing of <span style="font-style: italic;">American Idiot </span>at Berkeley Rep, world premiere musicals are few and far between, particularly when it comes to smaller theatres. Recently I have become aware of two world premiere musicals in the area, which I found to be an interesting convergence in happening (if not in theme): <span style="font-style: italic;">As Always </span>by Peter Tucker and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dogs! It's the Musical! </span>by Rose Tobin O'Connor. After speaking with Tucker and Silver Moon Productions artistic director Nellie Cravens, I was able to learn more about each production and shed light on some of the unique challenges of producing a world premiere musical.<br />Currently in performances through March 27 at the Eureka Theatre, <span style="font-style: italic;">As Always</span> (<a href="http://peterwtucker.com/">asalwaystickets.com</a>) traces a psychological journey through love, loss, and redemption during a single night of dreams, where inner battles come to life within the timely allegory of a foreign war. ?Dreams have always fascinated me," Tucker says about his inspiration for the piece. "We create a world every night that is an emotional echo chamber from our waking experiences. As both participant and observer in dreams, every image, experience, interaction and character necessarily is born from our subconscious mind. Without the filter of conscious thought while sleeping, our dreams can go places we can't.

"We create a world every night that is an emotional echo chamber from our waking experiences. As both participant and observer in dreams, every image, experience, interaction and character necessarily is born from our subconscious mind. Without the filter of conscious thought while sleeping, our dreams can go places we can't.

Rabkin analyzed the number of art forms respondents indicated they had studied, both as a child and as an adult, and found that an increase not only in any arts education, but of a diverse arts education yielded higher average rates of arts attendance in respondents ? and that the effect was even more evident with art forms studied as an adult. To pause here for a second, this seems to go against the current prevailing mutterings from some circles that the current adult generation may be simply lost to arts apathy, and that the focus should instead completely divert to children. Here?s the graph (taken from their presentation):<br /><br /><strong>F1. Arts Attendance Rate Predictions Based on Amount of Arts Attendance<br /></strong><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IcYm6SmPhoM/TWiE15dujvI/AAAAAAAAACs/aHoWqOlhMxk/s1600/fig1_artforms%2Bstudied.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 301px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5577854199991799538" border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IcYm6SmPhoM/TWiE15dujvI/AAAAAAAAACs/aHoWqOlhMxk/s320/fig1_artforms%2Bstudied.jpg" /></a><br />Taking, then, the fact that arts education is indeed quite important, Rabkin and Hedberg began an analysis of what has happened to arts education over the course of the SPPA, and indeed, over the last century.<br /><br />Starting simply, they looked at the percentage of 18-year-olds in each SPPA since 1982 who said they had had arts education as children. The numbers starkly declined from a 1982 high of 64% to a low in 2008 of 49.5%. The pace of decline is increasing precipitously as well. This itself indicates something of an issue, but then Rabkin and Hedberg did something fascinating. They extrapolated the ages of each of the respondents on every SPPA since 1982, and where from there able to figure out the year at which each person turned 18. Using that as an anchor, they laid out the percentage of respondents who experienced arts education as children for every year between 1930 and 2008, with this result:<br /><br /><strong>F2. Percentage of Childhood Arts Education, 1930-2008</strong><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O8Kzy_wLOmE/TWiFMNSeOqI/AAAAAAAAAC0/LBtzlC_Q7X4/s1600/fig2_artsed%2Bas%2Bkids.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 312px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5577854583270423202" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O8Kzy_wLOmE/TWiFMNSeOqI/AAAAAAAAAC0/LBtzlC_Q7X4/s320/fig2_artsed%2Bas%2Bkids.jpg" /></a><br /><br />What this graph shows is that in 1930, about 20% of children had any arts education. The number steadily rose until 1985, when it was at about 65%. It then began a consistent downward trend, passing through 50% in 2000. Per Rabkin, this downturn was precipitated by:<br /><ul><li>Widespread opposition to taxes associated with arts education, beginning with Prop 13 (right here in California). </li><li>The emergence of school reform as a high national priority. The report that spurred this reform effort was called ?Nation at Risk,? and was published in 1983. It encouraged raising standards and rigorous testing, and included practically no discussion of arts education. Per Rabkin, arts education has been marginalized ever since. </li></ul><p>A 15% decline is upsetting, but the problem is actually even more disasterous than on first look. The issue is that that decline is disproportionately affecting non-white populations, and not just a little. Since 1982, arts education for white has essentially stayed constant at about 58% of students. African-Americans and Hispanics, on the other hand, have seen a decline from around 50% of students in 1982 to half (!) that in 2008. The graph is incredibly disheartening:</p><p><strong>F3. % of Respondents Reporting Arts Education As Children by Race<br /></strong><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jqKjwWJZQ8w/TWiF3_RMltI/AAAAAAAAAC8/7OmRnw0viW8/s1600/fig3_artsed%2Bby%2Brace.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 317px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5577855335421220562" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jqKjwWJZQ8w/TWiF3_RMltI/AAAAAAAAAC8/7OmRnw0viW8/s320/fig3_artsed%2Bby%2Brace.jpg" /></a><br />I?ve written at length about the terribly disproportionate impact of arts education cuts on non-white populations. Essentially, it is a situation of discrimination by default?schools in less affluent districts (districts where neither the local municipality nor the parents can afford to shoulder the financial burden of providing arts education to their children) suffer more than schools in more affluent districts, and less affluent districts are disproportionately non-white. As I said in <a href="http://www.theatrebayarea.org/mag/article.jsp?thispage=archives.jsp&amp;id=595">an article on this subject</a> last year:</p><blockquote>In a country where, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2006 median household income for a whlte family was 158% that of a black family and 135% that of an Hispanic family, the fact that ubiquity of arts education is directly tied to affluence means that it?s de facto tied to race. </blockquote><p>Rabkin closed with some thoughts on the relationship between the decline in interest in the arts and the decline in arts education, and cautioned not to draw instant, direct connections between the two ? at least not only in one direction. Declining arts education may contribute to declining interest in the arts, but it can also go the other way, becoming what Rabkin called ?a bi-directional issue.? </p><p>Rabkin also cautioned us to understand that moaning about arts attendance and its ties to arts education isn?t going to get us very far with our legislators. In his term, he expected such arguments to be viewed as ?trivial.? Rather, we need to advocate for arts education on its own terms, secure in the knowledge that instituting such reform will likely generate some increase in arts attendance in the years to come. </p>";s:4:"link";s:82:"http://blog.theatrebayarea.org/2011/02/talking-about-declining-arts-education.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (Clay Lord)";s:7:"summary";s:8693:"<em>Recapping Research: the SPPA Follow-Up Monographs, Part 1 </em><br /><br />Yesterday, I had the opportunity to listen in on a two-hour presentation hosted by Sunil Iyengar, the head of research at the NEA.

African-Americans and Hispanics, on the other hand, have seen a decline from around 50% of students in 1982 to half (!) that in 2008. The graph is incredibly disheartening:</p><p><strong>F3. % of Respondents Reporting Arts Education As Children by Race<br /></strong><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jqKjwWJZQ8w/TWiF3_RMltI/AAAAAAAAAC8/7OmRnw0viW8/s1600/fig3_artsed%2Bby%2Brace.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 317px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5577855335421220562" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jqKjwWJZQ8w/TWiF3_RMltI/AAAAAAAAAC8/7OmRnw0viW8/s320/fig3_artsed%2Bby%2Brace.jpg" /></a><br />I?ve written at length about the terribly disproportionate impact of arts education cuts on non-white populations. Essentially, it is a situation of discrimination by default?schools in less affluent districts (districts where neither the local municipality nor the parents can afford to shoulder the financial burden of providing arts education to their children) suffer more than schools in more affluent districts, and less affluent districts are disproportionately non-white. As I said in <a href="http://www.theatrebayarea.org/mag/article.jsp?thispage=archives.jsp&amp;id=595">an article on this subject</a> last year:</p><blockquote>In a country where, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2006 median household income for a whlte family was 158% that of a black family and 135% that of an Hispanic family, the fact that ubiquity of arts education is directly tied to affluence means that it?s de facto tied to race. </blockquote><p>Rabkin closed with some thoughts on the relationship between the decline in interest in the arts and the decline in arts education, and cautioned not to draw instant, direct connections between the two ? at least not only in one direction. Declining arts education may contribute to declining interest in the arts, but it can also go the other way, becoming what Rabkin called ?a bi-directional issue.? </p><p>Rabkin also cautioned us to understand that moaning about arts attendance and its ties to arts education isn?t going to get us very far with our legislators. In his term, he expected such arguments to be viewed as ?trivial.? Rather, we need to advocate for arts education on its own terms, secure in the knowledge that instituting such reform will likely generate some increase in arts attendance in the years to come. </p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1298654100;}i:11;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1622774019969581060.post-4731178059475742491";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 22:08:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:103:"#newplay#SupplyDemandaccessadvocacyartsarts advocacyaudience developmentcollaborationcommunitydiversity";s:5:"title";s:78:"The New Play Sector Talked (and talked, and talked, and talked) in the Capital";s:11:"description";s:5591:"<em>This special guest blogpost from Playwrights Foundation Artistic Director Amy Mueller first appeared on <a href="http://www.playwrightsfoundation.blogspot.com/">Playwrights Foundation's Blogspot</a>.

Here are some samples from a blog he wrote in response to some of the criticism his speech got at </span><a href="http://www.arts.gov/artworks/?p=5402"><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >Art Works</span></a><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >, gathering around the hashtag #SupplyDemand:<br /><br /></span><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >?The NEA?s 2008 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA)?reports a five percentage point decrease in arts audiences in this country.

A lot of people got really mad at that idea, using many of the arguments being made back to Landesman about his proposals: </span><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that art is not commerce, and should not be treated in the same profit/loss, supply/demand way that commercial things are </span></li><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that arbitrating value of art is a waste of time, as the value is subjective and can be measured neither by the amount of money a piece of art generates nor by how many people see it </span></li><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that the playing field is uneven and grossly favors the largest animals in the forest. </span></li></ul><br /><p><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >I guess what I see here is what makes the arts world so fascinating and vibrant?the push/pull of aesthetes and economists, of artists and pragmatists (if those two things should be juxtaposed?I know plenty of pragmatic artists, although it?s worth pointing out that many of them are viewed as ?sell outs?).<br /><br />In a conversation yesterday about Landesman?s speech, one person who was there expressed how upset he was about what he saw as a lack of understanding that what Landesman was proposing would essentially rip the rug out from under many artists who have toiled away at this work for decades. Another said that she thought she probably agreed with a lot of what Landesman said, but that his tone was so off-putting she couldn?t be sure. I can understand both points, although from reading what has followed from Landesman, I?m not sure that?s what Landesman meant to convey.<br /><br />When you strip away the tone, rhetoric and personality associated with the ideas, I find (for myself, here) that I can?t really find flaw in the equation. I think of the apple tree in the backyard of my old apartment building, which sat untended and overgrown. Every year, what seemed like thousands and thousands of blossoms would pop open on the branches, and then all of them would be pollinated and, since we none of us owned the tree, no one would pinch off any of the fruit. The tree, every year, would become burdened by all the fruit?the branches would bend, the leaves would start to look weak, and the fruit itself was small and sallow?a victim of its own ubiquity.<br /><br />If we as an industry (as we have) have set ourselves up to believe that there?s always room for one more apple on the tree, that the default to success is to create a non-profit theatre company of your very own, then we shouldn?t be surprised that we?re all feeling a little malnourished. In this, of course, we need to lay the blame where it belongs, which is with everyone on every step of the ladder from top-heavy arts organizations that favor known artists over new blood to funders who only fund organizations (and then of a certain size, with a certain pedigree and production history) to, yes, service organizations and other support groups that have for years encouraged unchecked proliferation of organizations and an egalitarian, everyone-deserves-equal-support-regardless attitude.<br /><br />Might we not, as Landesman seems to be arguing at least in part, all feel a little healthier if we spent some time tending to ourselves?

Here are some samples from a blog he wrote in response to some of the criticism his speech got at </span><a href="http://www.arts.gov/artworks/?p=5402"><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >Art Works</span></a><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >, gathering around the hashtag #SupplyDemand:<br /><br /></span><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >?The NEA?s 2008 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA)?reports a five percentage point decrease in arts audiences in this country. This is juxtaposed against a 23% increase in not-for-profit arts organizations, and a rate of growth for not-for-profit performing arts organizations, specifically, that was 60% greater than that for the total U.S. population.?<br /><br /></span></blockquote><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >And later:<br /><br /></span><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >?I care passionately about the arts in this country, and I believe that they will always play a vital role in who we are as an American people.

A lot of people got really mad at that idea, using many of the arguments being made back to Landesman about his proposals: </span><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that art is not commerce, and should not be treated in the same profit/loss, supply/demand way that commercial things are </span></li><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that arbitrating value of art is a waste of time, as the value is subjective and can be measured neither by the amount of money a piece of art generates nor by how many people see it </span></li><br /><li><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >that the playing field is uneven and grossly favors the largest animals in the forest. </span></li></ul><br /><p><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);" >I guess what I see here is what makes the arts world so fascinating and vibrant?the push/pull of aesthetes and economists, of artists and pragmatists (if those two things should be juxtaposed?I know plenty of pragmatic artists, although it?s worth pointing out that many of them are viewed as ?sell outs?).<br /><br />In a conversation yesterday about Landesman?s speech, one person who was there expressed how upset he was about what he saw as a lack of understanding that what Landesman was proposing would essentially rip the rug out from under many artists who have toiled away at this work for decades. Another said that she thought she probably agreed with a lot of what Landesman said, but that his tone was so off-putting she couldn?t be sure. I can understand both points, although from reading what has followed from Landesman, I?m not sure that?s what Landesman meant to convey.<br /><br />When you strip away the tone, rhetoric and personality associated with the ideas, I find (for myself, here) that I can?t really find flaw in the equation. I think of the apple tree in the backyard of my old apartment building, which sat untended and overgrown. Every year, what seemed like thousands and thousands of blossoms would pop open on the branches, and then all of them would be pollinated and, since we none of us owned the tree, no one would pinch off any of the fruit. The tree, every year, would become burdened by all the fruit?the branches would bend, the leaves would start to look weak, and the fruit itself was small and sallow?a victim of its own ubiquity.<br /><br />If we as an industry (as we have) have set ourselves up to believe that there?s always room for one more apple on the tree, that the default to success is to create a non-profit theatre company of your very own, then we shouldn?t be surprised that we?re all feeling a little malnourished. In this, of course, we need to lay the blame where it belongs, which is with everyone on every step of the ladder from top-heavy arts organizations that favor known artists over new blood to funders who only fund organizations (and then of a certain size, with a certain pedigree and production history) to, yes, service organizations and other support groups that have for years encouraged unchecked proliferation of organizations and an egalitarian, everyone-deserves-equal-support-regardless attitude.<br /><br />Might we not, as Landesman seems to be arguing at least in part, all feel a little healthier if we spent some time tending to ourselves?

A few weeks ago, I was among those that got to see a performance in the sold-out run of <span style="font-style: italic;">Becoming Julia Morgan </span>at the Berkeley City Club (it closed January 9th). I was struck by the steady stream of audience members filing in (and those turned away) and was even more inspired by the fact that Becoming Julia Morgan is a self-produced project. I checked in with Belinda Taylor, the playwright, and producer Sabrina Klein to see how the experience of self-producing played out.<br /><br />Former <span style="font-style: italic;">Theatre Bay Area </span>(then <span style="font-style: italic;">Callboard</span>) editor-in-chief Belinda Taylor finished her first play a few years ago after being commissioned by Klein (who at the time was the executive director of the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts and former executive director of Theatre Bay Area. <span style="font-style: italic;">Becoming Julia Morgan</span>, a play investigating the life and legacy of the architectural legend, had an award-winning, sold-out run in Sacramento in 2006. The next step seemed obvious: mount a Bay Area production. But Taylor found it a bit harder for the idea to gain traction than she had anticipated, especially since Klein had since left JMCA. So what to do? Klein came on as producer and Barbara Oliver (legendary director and a founder of Aurora Theatre) joined up as director, and the nucleus of a huge self-producing project began. Klein says, ?It?s not like we said ?Hey, let?s produce the play on our own!? It was more, ?Ok, no one else believes in this play as much as we do, so let?s make it happen on our own.?<br /><br />Once the core group was established, the planning began in earnest. Luckily, this trio of esteemed professionals had varied experiences and a network of resources to tap into. A wide array of new contacts became interested in the show and supported the road to production. Playwrights Foundation became the fiscal sponsor. After a nudge from a colleague, Taylor found a couple who owned a Julia Morgan home and was willing to offer it up as a venue for a fundraiser. Various vendors contributed wine, food and other items for a silent auction at the fundraiser. Add to that list the performers who donated their time to the fundraiser in order  to give attendees a preview of the show, and this first fundraiser raised about half of what was needed to get the show going. A second fundraiser at a private residence raised the remainder. After securing pro bono PR work from Taylor?s colleague Gary Carr of Rising Moon Marketing; PR, things really started moving. Peets Coffee in Berkeley came on board and store manager Scott Soo-Hoo (of the Vine Street location in Berkeley) even created a ?Julia Morgan Roast? for the run of the play. Taylor says, ?My friends in Bay Area theatre and in Bay Area media were definitely an added bonus.?<br /><br />Klein refers to a number of benefits of self-producing: ?We were not tied to any mission outside this one show. We could brand ourselves strictly as experts on Julia Morgan and as three women who love architecture, history and Julia Morgan?s work, giving us a common bond with a lot of non-theatre people. We had no reputation to prove or to overcome (the flip side of having no reputation to build on!), which can be a positive. We were incredibly agile, responding to opportunities as they came up. Many small companies are like that, but we really felt it was a strength in our case too.?<br /> <br />Her biggest recommendations for the self-producer: Ask for advice and build on existing resources. In this case, what the team lacked in both infrastructure and access to a deep rolodex was offset by the expertise of those in the team members' inner circle. The members relied on their fiscal agent, Playwrights Foundation (to help with insurance, Actors' Equity and liability issues), CentralWorks (to help them understand what it would take to produce and perform in the space), neighboring theatre Shotgun Players (who provided a number of referrals and recommendations for the creative and support team) and, of course, Barbara Oliver (whose reputation helped bring quality designers into the mix). And you never know where someone in your circle will lead you. For example, Anne Smith got an invitation for the first fundraiser in March (the show opened in December) and instantly invited the team to appear at the Commonwealth Club in August. About 50 people who love Julia Morgan (or architecture, or historical female role models, or some combination of the three) showed up, including four who ended up as donors and one who ended up as a volunteer and who then made even more connections for the production in the world of architecture.<br /><br />Klein closes her advice with a note that a great ticketing service matters. In this case, the Julia Morgan team used a combination of Brown Paper Tickets and, yes, Theatre Bay Area?s own TIX (www.tixbayarea.org).<br /><br />Aside from logistics, were Klein and Taylor pleased with the final results? "It was an experience like no other," says Taylor of watching her play performed at the final preview. "Everything came together: costumes, lights, sound, scenery, props, actors.

They teeter dangerously on my nightstand and crowd my shelves like rush hour MUNI commuters. Orphaned about my apartment, these scripts stare longingly at me as I ignore them in favor of lesser entertainments. Yet I still thrill at the hunt every time I enter a new or used bookstore. I make a beeline for the drama section and comb the shelves looking for the next play that will inspire or corrupt, enlighten or injure, entertain or enrage. But after a recent trip to the Friends of the Library Book Sale (where I bought literally pounds of new plays), I have decided that enough is enough.

Here's the quote, with some extra context pulled from the article:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Oskar Eustis, artistic director of The Public Theater, said the arts need to be more accessible for everyone. Even the nonprofit theater's free Shakespeare in the Park creates barriers.<br /><br />?By giving Shakespeare away for free, it has become inaccessible for many,?

But, here at Theatre Bay Area, we're in the enviable or unenviable position of having a similar issue. We've been grappling with this same (relative) issue in the context of our Free Night of Theater program, in which we annually distribute about 5,000 to 6,000 free theatre tickets, and also annually disappoint between 20,000 and 30,000 unlucky people who don't get tickets, don't get the tickets they want, or get overly frustrated by the (admittedly arduous, or at least not hoop-free) process of getting the tickets.<br /><br /><br /><br />We've tried various ways to "share the wealth" of the program--we do targeted giveaways to businesses whose employees seem likely candidates to become repeat arts consumers while also setting up various roadblocks to dissuade repeat Free Nighters from being able to easily access the tickets. But it's hard, and so when I saw Eustis' quote it got me thinking.<br /><br /><br /><br />How can we, as artists, arts administrators and (yes) businesspeople balance success with access? How can we make sure, in the case of Free Night, that we're continuing to make the arts available to new people while also ensuring, for the companies' sakes, that we're getting those tickets to audiences that are likely to return (and pay)?

While I find public toenail hanging highly repulsive, I must admit that my first reaction to the idea of a "tweet night" at the theatre was not entirely positive.

From the moment I arrived at the Playhouse, I felt like I was in some sort of VIP club. SF Playhouse is very conscientious about making its pluggers feel as welcome as possible by doing two things: telling us not to censor ourselves and giving us free wine.<br /><br />The most exciting part of my experience as a live-tweeter (aside from the wine) was the community of pluggers of which I was a part. There was @anthoknees, a theatre aficionado and actor who learned of the program through a friend and jumped at the opportunity for free theatre tickets. There was comedian @aliciadattner, artistic director of <a href="http://www.chatrouletteshow.com/">The Illuminated Theatre</a> @jonathanwbender, theatre afficionado and second-time plugger @n_a_k, and plugger veteran @scottragle who had participated in every plugger's night since its inception back in March. Though I was a bit intimidated by the experienced tweeters and their shiny new iPhones, I was immediately accepted by them (even with my sad little Blackberry that had been overhauled hours earlier so as to run a functional Twitter app).<br /><br />"I just tweet my thoughts," said Anthony Williams (@anthoknees), sensing my hesitation during the last few minutes before the show started.

The lights went down in the theatre and I gave myself a little pep talk, something to the effect of "OK, brain, you've served me pretty well so far, but please please please find something more interesting to tweet about than 'actor 2 crosses stage left.'"<br /><br />While I had many reservations going into the experience, these concerns were quickly alleviated. Because what happened almost immediately is that, when the lights came up on the show, we entered into a fast-paced, on-topic, continually evolving conversation about the play (all typed, of course). Since I was watching my co-conspirators twitter their musings on the show while I was watching the show, I picked up on quite a few details that I might have missed otherwise. It was surprisingly exciting to have the instant gratification of tweeting an observation of the play and having that observation validated instantly by a community of alert, insightful theatregoers. I bonded with this group of strangers more than I have ever done at a theatre performance, even during post-show schmoozy-type parties. With so many theatre companies touting mission statements that declare a desire to bring people together through art, this is a pretty significant accomplishment in itself. Though I am usually a very attentive theatergoer, I don't believe I have ever engaged so fully with a play. I was so mentally exhausted by the end of the play from 90 straight minutes of watching, analyzing, reading and responding to all aspects of the play that all I wanted to do was go home and go to sleep.<br /><br />On the other hand, I must say that my experience of the art itself suffered. Because I was engaged with so many different forms, I missed some key plot points, pivotal shifts in the power dynamics and even a "happy accident"--when one of the actors (I'm assuming) mistakenly knocked over a glass of water, I found out about it first through the tweets of my peers and only looked up in time to see Carl Lumbly cleaning up the wreckage. In fact, I left the production feeling that I would need to see it again in order to get a complete sense of the artistic choices that were made by the actors, director and playwright.<br /><br />Ultimately, it strikes me that the debate over Twitter in theatre is a symptom of larger conversation that theatres are either avoiding or jumping into head-first: how do we remain relevant when the ways in which people engage with art (and each other) are changing? I very much doubt that allowing people to text during a play is the ultimate solution (not that it's claiming to be, or that there is one be-all-end-all solution) and it certainly isn't right for all theatres. But it is an interesting tool to remind us to reexamine the ways in which we as artists and/or forward-thinking arts administrators can use technology to our advantage rather than avoiding it altogether.<br /><br />What are you (either on the artistic or the marketing/admin side of things) doing to engage with this issue?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Information about the SF Playhouse Pluggers program can be found <a href="http://www.sfplayhouse.org/pages/pluggers.php">here</a>.

And I want to hate the whale because it's telling me that I can't do what I want to do, but then I discover that it's called the "Fail Whale" which is so obnoxiously cute that I can't muster more than a vague sense of disapproval for the whale. And then I just end up feeling guilty for disapproving of a whale that is clearly being stolen by a flock of evil supergenius birds on steroids that are probably going to conduct painful scientific experiments on the poor, unsuspecting whale.

Though I am usually a very attentive theatergoer, I don't believe I have ever engaged so fully with a play. I was so mentally exhausted by the end of the play from 90 straight minutes of watching, analyzing, reading and responding to all aspects of the play that all I wanted to do was go home and go to sleep.<br /><br />On the other hand, I must say that my experience of the art itself suffered. Because I was engaged with so many different forms, I missed some key plot points, pivotal shifts in the power dynamics and even a "happy accident"--when one of the actors (I'm assuming) mistakenly knocked over a glass of water, I found out about it first through the tweets of my peers and only looked up in time to see Carl Lumbly cleaning up the wreckage. In fact, I left the production feeling that I would need to see it again in order to get a complete sense of the artistic choices that were made by the actors, director and playwright.<br /><br />Ultimately, it strikes me that the debate over Twitter in theatre is a symptom of larger conversation that theatres are either avoiding or jumping into head-first: how do we remain relevant when the ways in which people engage with art (and each other) are changing? I very much doubt that allowing people to text during a play is the ultimate solution (not that it's claiming to be, or that there is one be-all-end-all solution) and it certainly isn't right for all theatres. But it is an interesting tool to remind us to reexamine the ways in which we as artists and/or forward-thinking arts administrators can use technology to our advantage rather than avoiding it altogether.<br /><br />What are you (either on the artistic or the marketing/admin side of things) doing to engage with this issue?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Information about the SF Playhouse Pluggers program can be found <a href="http://www.sfplayhouse.org/pages/pluggers.php">here</a>.

I mean, I actually find the concept of Twitter to be pretty cool, but every time I try to use it (ok, the half-dozen-or-so times I've tried to use it), something goes awry and I get that horrible whale-being-held-up-by-birds-that-must-possess-superbird-strength-because-they're-really-tiny-and-that-whale-is-huge. And I want to hate the whale because it's telling me that I can't do what I want to do, but then I discover that it's called the "Fail Whale" which is so obnoxiously cute that I can't muster more than a vague sense of disapproval for the whale. And then I just end up feeling guilty for disapproving of a whale that is clearly being stolen by a flock of evil supergenius birds on steroids that are probably going to conduct painful scientific experiments on the poor, unsuspecting whale. I could really go on and on about the emotional turmoil caused by my encounters with that silly, complicated whale but I have a blog post to get back to.</span>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1288976640;}i:19;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1622774019969581060.post-7558663960831482092";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 03 Nov 2010 16:59:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:48:"arts advocacyarts participationgovernmentvictory";s:5:"title";s:26:"Arts Message Gets Through!";s:11:"description";s:1126:"<div>Did everyone hear Governor-Elect Jerry Brown's victory speech last night?

I received an email back from the artistic director, who had also directed the show, saying that she hoped I still wanted to come, but that she felt that she had to tell me in advance that she would be going on carrying a script in place of an actor that had left the show. Of course I still went, not only because I know her to be a great actor and wanted to support the theatre, but also because I had great deal of interest in seeing this particular show. I replied as such and also added, in jest, something to the effect of ?I hope you aren?t also house managing and running the light board!" Imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre and she actually was house managing!<br /></p> <br />I was reminded of an opening night performance I attended a number of years ago at a large Equity house, where the lead actor had left the show a few days before opening and the director went on in place of the actor, script in hand. It was one of the most memorable and moving nights of theatre I have ever experienced.  In that case, the artistic director made a pre-show announcement providing the context of ?Oh, the joys of live theatre.?  In both cases, the script became virtually invisible, either due to the skillful physical handling of the script, the performance/skill of the director/actor or some combination of the two.<br /><br />What struck me most about both of these experiences is that there was an almost palpable electricity onstage. There seemed to be a renewed focus and increased energy from all of the players. The actors and the entire production team rallied together in a way they couldn?t have possibly done in the absence of  this adversity. The end result, though likely very different from the rehearsed "product," was, in my estimation, probably a more energized, committed and focused performance for all.<br /><br />The audience in both of these cases approached their experience differently as well. They were almost uniformly rooting for the team to pull it off and even looked forward to the story they would be able to tell their theatre-going friends: ?I was there when?.? They also were, probably unconsciously, even more attentive, observant and gracious than they would have been otherwise.<br /><br />While none of us would ever wish for something to go awry during the run  of a show, such instances epitomize some of the things I love most  about theatre: its risk and its immediacy. As an artist, these brushes with theatre "disasters" remind me to challenge myself:  am I always bringing as much focus and commitment  to the work I am doing as I can?<br /><br />I?m sure we all have many similar stories, at theatres large and small. What are some of your best "I was there when..." stories (either as an audience member or as an actor)? How did the theatre "disasters" affect the experience as a whole, either for the actors or for the audience members?";s:4:"link";s:67:"http://blog.theatrebayarea.org/2010/10/oh-joys-of-live-theatre.html";s:6:"author";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Dale Albright)";s:7:"summary";s:20216:"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

I received an email back from the artistic director, who had also directed the show, saying that she hoped I still wanted to come, but that she felt that she had to tell me in advance that she would be going on carrying a script in place of an actor that had left the show. Of course I still went, not only because I know her to be a great actor and wanted to support the theatre, but also because I had great deal of interest in seeing this particular show. I replied as such and also added, in jest, something to the effect of ?I hope you aren?t also house managing and running the light board!" Imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre and she actually was house managing!<br /></p> <br />I was reminded of an opening night performance I attended a number of years ago at a large Equity house, where the lead actor had left the show a few days before opening and the director went on in place of the actor, script in hand. It was one of the most memorable and moving nights of theatre I have ever experienced.  In that case, the artistic director made a pre-show announcement providing the context of ?Oh, the joys of live theatre.?  In both cases, the script became virtually invisible, either due to the skillful physical handling of the script, the performance/skill of the director/actor or some combination of the two.<br /><br />What struck me most about both of these experiences is that there was an almost palpable electricity onstage. There seemed to be a renewed focus and increased energy from all of the players. The actors and the entire production team rallied together in a way they couldn?t have possibly done in the absence of  this adversity. The end result, though likely very different from the rehearsed "product," was, in my estimation, probably a more energized, committed and focused performance for all.<br /><br />The audience in both of these cases approached their experience differently as well. They were almost uniformly rooting for the team to pull it off and even looked forward to the story they would be able to tell their theatre-going friends: ?I was there when?.?

But we continue to grapple with how best to talk about that value, to ?justify? (a loaded word) or ?prove? that the continued investment in infrastructure, arts education outreach and daily artistic input into the population-at-large is necessary to the creation of a tolerant, educated, empathic and energized society.  The great work of Randy Cohen and Americans for the Arts on the economic front, including the creation of the Arts and Economic Prosperity Calculator, have gone a long way towards standardizing the arguments around economic impact of arts and culture, and has essentially gotten us all on the same page.  But, and this language is getting to be a cliche, economic impact is only part of the answer ? half of the answer at most, really ? and getting to the point where we can talk about the intellectual, emotional, social, empathic impacts of the arts in the same specific, data-driven way as we can talk about the economics may open up a brave new world of advocacy for money, time and respect from the government, the funding establishment, the education system and our patrons.<br /><br />Of course, in some ways, we?re already good at getting at some version of what researcher Alan Brown calls the ?intrinsic impact? of art ? mostly in the form of testimonials from arts patrons.  A well-formed interview can get you incredible stories of the transformational power of art, and such things, when well-packaged, can prove very valuable in the conversation with arts skeptics about the value of artistic work.  But interviews are really, truly only part of the answer here, and as part of the National Arts Marketing Project Conference session, Did the Campaign Work?: Integrating Impact Assessment into your Strategies, we (Theatre Bay Area) will be unveiling a year-long research and development effort to create a web-based service for theaters and other arts organizations across the country to quantify the intrinsic impact of their work, generate easy-to-read dashboards, and provide sample survey and interview protocols to generate a new type of conversation using a new vocabulary.  Working with research firm WolfBrown and arts service organization partners in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, Theatre Bay Area will generate a year-long set of activities focused around in-depth work with 18 theatre companies (including some of the most influential regional theaters in the country from Arena Stage to the Public Theater) across the course of a season.

But we continue to grapple with how best to talk about that value, to ?justify? (a loaded word) or ?prove? that the continued investment in infrastructure, arts education outreach and daily artistic input into the population-at-large is necessary to the creation of a tolerant, educated, empathic and energized society.  The great work of Randy Cohen and Americans for the Arts on the economic front, including the creation of the Arts and Economic Prosperity Calculator, have gone a long way towards standardizing the arguments around economic impact of arts and culture, and has essentially gotten us all on the same page.  But, and this language is getting to be a cliche, economic impact is only part of the answer ? half of the answer at most, really ? and getting to the point where we can talk about the intellectual, emotional, social, empathic impacts of the arts in the same specific, data-driven way as we can talk about the economics may open up a brave new world of advocacy for money, time and respect from the government, the funding establishment, the education system and our patrons.<br /><br />Of course, in some ways, we?re already good at getting at some version of what researcher Alan Brown calls the ?intrinsic impact? of art ? mostly in the form of testimonials from arts patrons.  A well-formed interview can get you incredible stories of the transformational power of art, and such things, when well-packaged, can prove very valuable in the conversation with arts skeptics about the value of artistic work.  But interviews are really, truly only part of the answer here, and as part of the National Arts Marketing Project Conference session, Did the Campaign Work?: Integrating Impact Assessment into your Strategies, we (Theatre Bay Area) will be unveiling a year-long research and development effort to create a web-based service for theaters and other arts organizations across the country to quantify the intrinsic impact of their work, generate easy-to-read dashboards, and provide sample survey and interview protocols to generate a new type of conversation using a new vocabulary.  Working with research firm WolfBrown and arts service organization partners in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, Theatre Bay Area will generate a year-long set of activities focused around in-depth work with 18 theatre companies (including some of the most influential regional theaters in the country from Arena Stage to the Public Theater) across the course of a season.  This work will include a whole battery of efforts from surveying to long-form interviews, video testimonials, web interface development, and a series of community forums in fall 2010 and summer 2011 ? all in an effort to spark a change in the way we, as artists, evaluate and value the arts.

As a part of this work, we are sitting down with the artistic, marketing and management staff of each of the participating theaters for two hours to talk through the survey protocol and, more generally, to talk about where research, and specifically research about audience feedback, falls into the artistic selection process. Boy, do responses vary.<br /><br />In some cases, the staff seem to have a healthy conversation going with their audiences, creating what researcher Alan Brown, who is conducting the study via his firm WolfBrown, calls a "feedback loop." In other cases, the response seems muddy, and often indicates that the internal conversation about this question hasn't yet happened - or at least that a coherent consensus hasn't yet been reached.  And then there are the companies that have a very clear view of things, and that view is that audience feedback sits nowhere near artistic selection.<br /><br />I don't know that there is a right answer here, although coming at it from a marketing point of view I see some real downsides to not at least taking audience feedback, especially the type of "intrinsic effects" feedback we are talking about in this study, into account at all.  After one of the meetings, Alan talked to me about how he is fascinated by those maverick artistic directors who don't really engage in a conversation with their audiences, but manage to succeed (sometimes fabulously).  Artists like that exist, and their existence is fantastic - they are able to build experiences that audiences don't even know they want. These people remind me of visual artists like Pollock, Picasso and Van Gogh, who created from their own vision, and who managed to tap into the public's vision over time.<br /><br />What is hard for me is that it seems clear that for every Van Gogh, there are thousands of artists out there who don't quite hit the zeitgeist, but think they will.  When you loop it back to theatre, these are the leaders of theatre companies who think they are thisclose to being visionaries, to creating monumental work, but are in fact creating a bunch of insulated work that isn't really connecting. Maybe these artists are aware of this problem but don't feel that changing is a valid way forward. Or (more likely, I think) maybe these artists don't actually know whether or not their work is affecting in the ways they want it to be.<br /><br />Ultimately, of course, the work becomes unsustainable if no one will pay to see it.

We are prepared for some companies to simply set these results on a shelf and never look at them, though we hope that won't be the case.  But even if in the end the leaders of a company decide that this type of work isn't their cup of tea, hopefully they'll figure out why they are resistant, and what the perceived threat is, and how real it is.
