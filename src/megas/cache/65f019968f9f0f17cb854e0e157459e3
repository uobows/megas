<p>	&mdash; Rob Rogacki (@BYBRob) <a href="https://twitter.com/BYBRob/status/978400616685989888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Let&#39;s start with some background here. Loyola starts a traditional center&mdash;6&#39;9&quot;, 260-pound Cameron Krutwig&mdash;who plays about half of their minutes; when Krutwig leaves the court, they don&#39;t field a player taller than 6&#39;6&quot;. Meanwhile, FSU went small for much of the second half against Michigan, and an attempted response by John Beilein with Isaiah Livers at center didn&#39;t go well. Livers looked lost and M got outscored 8-3 by FSU in that stretch despite getting an extra possession, failing to make a shot from the field.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chance Duncan Robinson could function much better at center. He&#39;s well-versed in the system on both ends to the point that he probably knows the center&#39;s assignments better than Livers, he&#39;s defended well in the post, and he&#39;s been utilized in the offense as a screener with some frequency of late. The worry is a small-ball team would expose his sub-par perimeter defense. I think Robinson could match up well with 6&#39;5&quot;, 230-pound forward Aundre Jackson, and in that case Michigan may very well want to go small along with Loyola&mdash;a Michigan Lineup of Death with Robinson at center is certainly intriguing in the right circumstances.</p>
<p>That said, Beilein may also choose to flip that mismatch the other way. Loyola&#39;s offense hasn&#39;t been effective without Krutwig, plummeting from 1.21&nbsp;points per possession when he&#39;s on the court to 0.96 PPP when he&#39;s off during the NCAA Tournament, according to <a href="http://hooplens.com" target="_blank">Hoop Lens</a>. Their defense has also suffered, allowing 1.08 PPP when he&#39;s off versus 0.93 PPP when he&#39;s on because they can no longer stop anyone inside the arc&mdash;their 2-point percentage allowed balloons from 45.6% to 56.5%.</p>
<p>I have serious questions about Krutwig&#39;s ability to handle Michigan&#39;s five-out offense; he&#39;s not nearly the caliber of athlete as FSU&#39;s big men nor is he close to their level as a shot-blocker. Either way, Loyola is going to go small at times. I believe it may be in Michigan&#39;s best interest to keep playing their normal rotation unless they discover a true Lineup of Death during practice this week.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">How many minutes do you expect teske to get vs Loyola with them having smaller lineup? It looked like we took advantage of teams with 7 footers out there so do you expect Loyola to do the same when he is out there? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mgomailbag?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mgomailbag</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I think Teske will get his normal allotment of minutes unless Moe Wagner goes off, which is a distinct possibility against Krutwig and people who can&#39;t really challenge his shot. Teske wouldn&#39;t provide the same level of mismatch, but we could see him work the pick-and-roll like he did against Purdue in the BTT when Krutwig is on the floor, and there&#39;s a chance he can flip the Loyola small-ball mismatch by overwhelming them with his size on both ends.</p>
<p>Like Robinson, Teske could possibly match up with Jackson, who&#39;s capable of stretching the floor but doesn&#39;t attempt many threes (20/54 this year). That might not be an ideal matchup for Michigan&#39;s defense; at the same time, I don&#39;t know how small-ball Loyola would handle a true seven-footer with good rebounding instincts and finishing ability on the other end.</p>
<p>Beilein has a lot of options here. He&#39;ll ride Wagner as long as he&#39;s putting opponents in the usual bind; after that, he has a couple viable choices for countering Loyola&#39;s undersized group. No matter who sees the floor for Michigan, they may be at a big advantage when the Ramblers go small&mdash;that&#39;s when they like to get out in transition, and in case we haven&#39;t pounded this into your head enough, the Wolverines have the best defense in the country at preventing opportunities and limiting efficiency on the fast break.</p>

	<em>WHERE&#39;S THE LOVE? [Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Ace,</p>
<p>Love your stuff.&nbsp; Seems to me the critical importance of Simpson, most especially his lock down defense on the opponent&rsquo;s primary ballhandler, but also his taking direction of the offense, is vastly overlooked &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t even make the all-tournament team from the last weekend, much less the Big1G all-defensive team.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your take?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you missed it, Zavier Simpson got robbed again: the all-tournament team from the West region featured MVP Charles Matthews, Moe Wagner, MAAR, and two Seminoles, one of whom (Terrance Mann) recorded all of four points with two assists, four turnovers, and four fouls in 35 minutes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mann scored 18 points the game before, however, and the people who vote for these things tend to look at box scores when making their choices. The box score doesn&#39;t just undervalue what Simpson did last weekend on defense, it also fails to show his true offensive contributions&mdash;he gets to ten assists against FSU instead of the five he recorded if Wagner and Co. can hit <em>anything</em> from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, Simpson turned every point guard he faced into a pile of inefficient goo.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just voters overlooking Z. CBS <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/2018-ncaa-tournament-ranking-every-one-of-the-20-starting-players-in-the-final-four/" target="_blank">ranked him 16th</a> of the 20 starters in the Final Four despite acknowledging the stat line doesn&#39;t &quot;tell the full story.&quot; ESPN&#39;s John Gasaway <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/insider/story/_/id/22920896/top-25-players-final-four" target="_blank">put him 22nd among the top 25 players</a> in the Final Four. Someone forward all of these to Simpson, please.</p>
<p>Matthews was the team&#39;s MVP last weekend, but Simpson was just behind him, and I don&#39;t think any other Wolverine came close. I think the team would agree with that assessment, too.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I think Teske will get his normal allotment of minutes unless Moe Wagner goes off, which is a distinct possibility against Krutwig and people who can&#39;t really challenge his shot. Teske wouldn&#39;t provide the same level of mismatch, but we could see him work the pick-and-roll like he did against Purdue in the BTT when Krutwig is on the floor, and there&#39;s a chance he can flip the Loyola small-ball mismatch by overwhelming them with his size on both ends.</p>
<p>Like Robinson, Teske could possibly match up with Jackson, who&#39;s capable of stretching the floor but doesn&#39;t attempt many threes (20/54 this year). That might not be an ideal matchup for Michigan&#39;s defense; at the same time, I don&#39;t know how small-ball Loyola would handle a true seven-footer with good rebounding instincts and finishing ability on the other end.</p>
<p>Beilein has a lot of options here. He&#39;ll ride Wagner as long as he&#39;s putting opponents in the usual bind; after that, he has a couple viable choices for countering Loyola&#39;s undersized group. No matter who sees the floor for Michigan, they may be at a big advantage when the Ramblers go small&mdash;that&#39;s when they like to get out in transition, and in case we haven&#39;t pounded this into your head enough, the Wolverines have the best defense in the country at preventing opportunities and limiting efficiency on the fast break.</p>

	<em>WHERE&#39;S THE LOVE? [Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Ace,</p>
<p>Love your stuff.&nbsp; Seems to me the critical importance of Simpson, most especially his lock down defense on the opponent&rsquo;s primary ballhandler, but also his taking direction of the offense, is vastly overlooked &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t even make the all-tournament team from the last weekend, much less the Big1G all-defensive team.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your take?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you missed it, Zavier Simpson got robbed again: the all-tournament team from the West region featured MVP Charles Matthews, Moe Wagner, MAAR, and two Seminoles, one of whom (Terrance Mann) recorded all of four points with two assists, four turnovers, and four fouls in 35 minutes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mann scored 18 points the game before, however, and the people who vote for these things tend to look at box scores when making their choices. The box score doesn&#39;t just undervalue what Simpson did last weekend on defense, it also fails to show his true offensive contributions&mdash;he gets to ten assists against FSU instead of the five he recorded if Wagner and Co. can hit <em>anything</em> from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, Simpson turned every point guard he faced into a pile of inefficient goo.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just voters overlooking Z. CBS <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/2018-ncaa-tournament-ranking-every-one-of-the-20-starting-players-in-the-final-four/" target="_blank">ranked him 16th</a> of the 20 starters in the Final Four despite acknowledging the stat line doesn&#39;t &quot;tell the full story.&quot; ESPN&#39;s John Gasaway <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/insider/story/_/id/22920896/top-25-players-final-four" target="_blank">put him 22nd among the top 25 players</a> in the Final Four. Someone forward all of these to Simpson, please.</p>
<p>Matthews was the team&#39;s MVP last weekend, but Simpson was just behind him, and I don&#39;t think any other Wolverine came close. I think the team would agree with that assessment, too.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Illinois State to the Final Four [Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<p><strong>Talkin' 'bout Yak</strong>. Sam Webb interviews Illinois State head coach Dan Muller, who actively tried to get his assistants the jobs at Michigan <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Illinois-State-headman-Dan-Muller-gave-Luke-Yaklich-his-first-college-job-and-isnt-the-least-bit-surprised-by-his-former-assistants-impact-on-Michigan-116768327" target="_blank">they in fact got</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>?I was talking to him about the next step in his career and what he wanted to do, what his aspirations were as a coach, and how I could help,? Muller recalled. ?He said, ?hey, what do you think about Michigan?? And I said, ?I think that would be a great place for you. Have you ever met Coach Beilein? (He said), ?no.? I said, ?okay look, in this business I am going to tell you the odds are you won't get the job because you've never met him. A lot of times coaches hire guys that they know or have met at least.? I said, ?if you want, I'll call him and just see.?&quot;</p>
<p>?I called Coach Beilein that day and left him a message. He called me back a couple days later and said thank you very much, but I've got a couple of guys I think I'm going to hire. I actually recommended <b><a href="https://247sports.com/Coach/DeAndre-Haynes-2600">DeAndre Haynes</a></b>, also, who was on my staff. I said, ?coach that's fine. If anything changes give me a call. I think both of these guys would be terrific for you.?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is incredible on many levels. Beilein listened to a cold call about a couple of guys he didn't know, did the requisite research to bridge that gap, and hired both of the Illinois State guys on offer. And the guy who'd hired them in the first place and saw them build a team that absolutely should have gotten an at-large NCAA bid in the MVC was selfless enough to kick that process off. </p>
<p><strong>Additional YAK.</strong> Yahoo's Jeff Eisenberg has another <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/assistant-coach-humble-roots-became-key-michigans-final-four-run-175719995.html" target="_blank">long feature on Michigan's defensive coordinator</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first priority Yaklich drilled into his team before Saturday?s game was to take away Florida State?s vaunted transition attack. The Wolverines responded by not surrendering a single fast-break point to a Seminoles team that scored 14 two nights earlier against Gonzaga.</p>
<p>The second point of emphasis from Yaklich was keeping Florida State from generating second-chance points. Michigan held the Seminoles below their season average in offensive rebounding percentage despite playing four guards for most of the game.</p>
<p>Yaklich?s final objective was to successfully foil Florida State?s pick-and-roll game and force the Seminoles to win the game shooting contested jumpers. The Wolverines fought over screens, made crisp rotations and recovered to shooters quickly, contributing to the Seminoles scoring almost nothing easy at the rim from start to finish.</p>
<p>?You have to take away the roll man against Florida State,? Yaklich said. ?They?re so big and long. You watch them on video, and they?re throwing dunks in from five or six feet away. We just had to stop their momentum to the basket and then it?s the effort we always talk about on defense of getting back to the shooters.</p>
<p>?We have a phrase that we yell every day in practice every time a ball screen is set, and that?s ?Do your job.? That means you?ve got to sprint to where you?re supposed to be right away. Those practice habits helped.?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Uh? what?</strong> Yahoo collects a bunch of coach quotes about the Final Four teams, and the guy talking about Michigan is a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/coaches-predict-will-win-final-four-matchups-010556255.html" target="_blank">little cheesed off at the end</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Loyola can beat their asses. Everyone saying this is a mismatch is wrong. Loyola has a bunch of like pieces, which screws up Michigan?s offense. It?s going to be a defensive-type game, which means that anyone can win. Look at the teams Michigan feasted on: Texas A&amp;M, Purdue, Michigan State and Nebraska in the Big Ten tournament. If you play big like those teams, they are going to annihilate you. If you switch and junk it up and play almost guerrilla-warfare coverage on defense, they?ll struggle to score. If you can switch, which Loyola does 1 through 4, this game will be close.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a lot of problems with these assertions. One: Nebraska switches one through five better than anyone else in the Big Ten because Isaiah Roby is an elite defender. Two: Loyola's center is a plodder who's extremely ill-suited to switching. Three: who cares about switching 1-4? How many PG-SF pick and rolls do we think Michigan is running? </p>
<p>Also this was a bit of an odd assertion: </p>
<blockquote><p>One thing we noticed was that they?re unbelievably handsy and grabby. I was almost taken aback at how physical they are. You don?t expect it. It?s going to be a physical game, you have to be ready to fight in the streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't say I've noticed a FIGHT IN THE STREETS kind of defense except for that one game against MSU, but I guess that's the word on the street. Mostly they just contest stuff. That doesn't make them WVU. </p>

<h3>
	1. Boston University</h3>
<p><em>starts at 1:00</em></p>
<p>Exceeded our best hopes by ten pairwise spots. Tighter than the 6-3 score, weird bounces, Michigan hung on with two really good goals. Weird to see Michigan less talented than an opponent, though it wasn&rsquo;t by that much. Except for an amazing play by a guy literally already in the NHL this morning Mel was able to scheme these guys out of the middle. Weird BU coaching: left their best power play weapon off special teams.</p>
<h3>
	2. Northeastern</h3>
<p><em>starts at 19:00</em></p>
<p>If we had to pick one team not to play in the first round it would have been them or Duluth. Swallowed whistles of playoffs helped neutralize that power play but the real difference was using Hughes to control possession against that top line. Michigan outplayed them 5-on-5 so that PK time was a big deal. Very impressed with Primeau&rsquo;s son versus Michigan&rsquo;s onslaught.</p>
<h3>
	3. How Did We Get Here?</h3>
<p><em>starts at 32:31</em></p>
<p>Mel Pearson with the best first-year coaching job at Michigan since 1969. Started the season behind Michigan State, broke out after the break despite losing Will Lockwood. The more time Mel got with the defense the less leaky they became, helped that Lavigne locked down the starting spot in net&mdash;they can practice to emphasize his hugeness. Underrated moment for this year: the Pastujov line coming together to provide a solid third line&mdash;Michigan has its lower lines for 2-3 more years! Norris playing a defensive role despite being a 1st rounder is a huge value for this team. Slaker really came along too. Mel doesn&rsquo;t ask guys to do things who don&rsquo;t have those skills.</p>
<h3>
	4. Frozen Four Preview</h3>
<p><em>starts at 50:56</em></p>
<p>Notre Dame: every game has been the same, Michigan barely surviving but proving they&rsquo;re similarly talented&mdash;ND is just many more years into their Mel transition. Jeff Jackson might be one of the best coaches in college hockey history and is still at his peak over a decade into his last job. Giving him two weeks to prepare for this is not great. ND not a behemoth this year&mdash;not more talented than M in terms of draft picks, etc. Great goalie, but stay out of the box and play five-on-five.</p>
<p>Minn-Duluth had to play through injuries and five players at the Juniors so they&rsquo;re really good when they&rsquo;re together. Duluth will have home ice. They&rsquo;re like Notre Dame with more offensive talent, and older, and with NoDak&rsquo;s fans. Excellent on special teams. Not really rivals in hockey but want to slay this dragon.</p>

<p align="center"><em>[Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<p align="left"><em>[Ed. A- Thanks to Isaiah Hole for sending along video so I could transcribe this, as I wasn?t able to be there due to some medical issues in my family]</em></p>
<p align="left">?How?s everybody doin?? We good? Doin? great. I think. Forty-one years, so?still rollin?. We?re three practices in. Two good ones in no pads. Lot of learning, lot of football being digested. As you know here, that?s what we do. </p>
<p align="left">?Can?t say enough good things about Herb[ert] and the strength staff. Really gave us a really solid group of guys in terms of cardiovascular and bigger, stronger, faster, and just glad to be back with my guys. </p>
<p align="left">?Been doing this a long time. This might be if not the fastest then one of the fastest groups I?ve ever been around, so pretty excited about it. Obviously we?ve got a lot of things to work on but we?ll get there. There?s no question in my mind.?</p>
<p align="left"><strong>With Devin and Khaleke, can you talk about some of those guys that are challenging the other guys at linebacker?</strong></p>
<p align="left">?Well, let me just say this, okay? This Devin Bush Jr.? Special guy now, okay? That?s all I?m gonna say. There?s a private story, but this guy stayed with his team. He could have easily checked out for three or four days and <em>everybody</em> would have understood and he didn?t. So, I think we?re talking about a guy whose character is completely off the charts. </p>
<p align="left">?This Khaleke Hudson is playing at a tremendous level a year ago, and I think he?s a much better cover guy right now. He?s playing at a much faster rate. He should go kiss Ben Herbert on the lips because he?s helped him tremendously.</p>
<p align="left">?This Josh Ross is gonna be a dude. He?s gonna be a really good player. Drew Singleton will be a very good player. Noah Furbush, his arrow is so far up from a year ago. I?m just very excited about where he is. Glasgow, we made the move from Viper behind Khaleke, took the slot coverage off his plate, and that?s helped him improve.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>[I had to split this in the middle of an answer which tells you a lot about the quality of the responses after THE JUMP]</strong></p>

<a name="more"></a><!--break--><!--break--><p align="left">?Up front, Rashan Gary?s, you know, Rashan Gary, you know? He?s a good player. Tremendous player. Chase [Winovich] gives you everything he?s got every single day. This Kwity Paye came in here, I don?t know, probably 235, 236, out of nowhere in Rhode Island, Bishop Hendricken, and he?s 263 right now. He?s like a muscle from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, so, you know, he?s really exceeded expecations. Lo Marhshall?s done a very good job. Aubrey Solomon, you know, sky?s the limit. The guy that was showing great?taking great steps a year ago during the bowl prep was Dwumfour. He hasn?t slowed. I just hope I?m not missing anybody up front, because I really feel very strongly we?ll have seven or eight guys there. I?m glad Lo Marshall?s coming back. Bryan Mone?s playing really well. I don?t know what his weight is, but it?s just so much better distributed throughout his body. Very strong, very physical guy. Let?s make no mistake about it, when he?s in there, he?s in there to do one thing: knock back whoever he?s against and play the run, and when it?s time to do the other things, we?ll figure it out and get somebody else in for him.</p>
<p align="left">?Seondary-wise, if you ask me, the guys that have made the biggest jump: Ambry Thomas has practiced extremely well for three practices. I?m talking jumpers now. You know we?ve got Lavert [Hill] and David Long, Brandon Watson. Those three guys are veteran guys that are playing pretty good, but this Ambry Thomas, now? Different level. Confident. Fast. He ran through on a sweep play?now, again, we were in pajamas the other day, so it?s not a physical thing, it?s just like <em>Wow, that was fast</em>, so happy with him. Jaylen Kelly-Powell, we?ve got him at safety. Really smart football player. Is playing so much better, so those would be the two guys that I would say. Metellus is <em>choooo</em> [mimics a rocket tacking off]. You know, some people were critical of him in the fall. Not me, but some people, but the bottom line for him is he?s taken this offseason as an opportunity to get better. It?s a beautiful thing. Some guys just wallow. He?s taken it and his arrow is completely up and doing a really good job of directing traffic back there.?</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Which of the linebackers are working at that Will spot to replace McCray?</strong></p>
<p>?Well, this Devin Gil? Dude now. Probably if you said to me ?Who?s benefited the most from Ben Herbert?,? he has. He?s faster, he?s bigger, he?s stronger. Smarts was never an issue, and it?s hard to say this but Mike McCray was so damn smart and had such just a good, solid instinct about how the game?s supposed to be played and his fits and you could tell him things week to week and change it one gameplan to another and he was great. This is that kind of guy, <em>except</em> I didn?t know if athletically?if you had asked me a year ago athletically can this guy make it, I would have been <em>eh, I don?t know yet. </em>He can make it.</p>
<p>?It?s he, Josh Ross, and Drew Singleton right now, and obviously we got Jordan [Anthony] and Devin Bush. I?m cross-training one of the guys at Mike and Will and&#160; obviously McGrone will join us in June, so I?m feeling like that?s six guys there. Pretty good dudes. Then you take Uche, who, he?s a package guy but now he?s becoming a linebacker. Played in high school with his hand on the ground. Now all of a sudden he?s doing a much better job in coverage and just playing at a much higher, higher level. He, Furbush, Khalkee, Glasgow, and then I?m kind of bouncing around with personnel groups like we do on third down. Obviously the most important down in college football is the get-off-the-field down, so he?s making a big impact, and we expect him to make a big impact, on third down. Now the question is can he help us on first and second down and I think he?s going that way.?</p>
<p><strong>How have your two early-enrollees looked so far?</strong></p>
<p>?Uh, Myles Sims? Had a big play today. Not out of place. I?m talking about you watch him make a break on the ball and I kind of went <em>Damn, he?s big </em>[holds hands level with the top of his head]. He?s got a ways to go but really happy with the mindset, the demeanor, the confidence level. He?s not afraid, and here he is in our deal lining up close to people and we?re expecting him to perform, which is a big deal. So, really happy with him. Tremendously happy. You asking me about Joe Milton??</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Upshaw.</strong></p>
<p>?Oh, Taylor. Um, good, young, fast, athletic, and willing. We need to get him a couple cheeseburgers and some baked beans and some pizza and he?ll be just fine. We?ve gotta put some meat on his bones but outstanding athlete, quick twitched, fast learner, so we expect big things from him. </p>
<p>?The thing that you have to do is you have to kind of keep it in your head: he?s supposed to be getting ready for the prom this week and he?s here, so that?s a huge advantage, <em>but</em> my mind tells me don?t <em>Don?t evaluate a young man who?s a midyear guy for a year</em>. That?s basically how I try to look at it unless he just jumps off the charts and says <em>I?m gonna make you play me</em>. So, we?ll see, and it?s too early. It?s three days in. They?re sitting in the meeting room as we?re putting in the first install and if I looked at them this would be their expression:</p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1.png"><img title="don brown 1" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="don brown 1" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_thumb.png" width="554" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>?I mean literally. <em>Alright, we?re gonna go baa baa baa and when they give us trips we check this, when they go to four quicks, we do that.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_0.png"><img title="don brown 1" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="don brown 1" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_thumb_0.png" width="554" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>?So, you know, it?s not an easy proposition for sure, but he?s a smart guy. Dad?s a good guy too, so you can see where he gets it from the football piece. We?re excited to have him for sure.?</p>
<p><strong>Last year you didn?t return a lot of starting experience. You?ve reminded all of us they did play, though. They did come in with some experience. This year you?ve got starting experience and experience. How does that change your expectations of this group?</strong></p>
<p>?You know, all I can tell you is every group?s a new group. Are they going to put the work in all 15, are they gonna cut corners, or are they just gonna grind. Now, every indication that I can give you is our guys are on this plateau going this way [does what looks like airplane taking off with hand]. We?re three practices in and you know how sometimes you can tell, is the room with you or is the room? are there a lot of distractions and a lot of stuff going on? We just don?t have that, so really happy with where we are and got a long way to go, obviously. </p>
<p>?Health is always important in spring because it can create some tough matchups for you, but at the same time you find out if somebody?s going to step up and surprise you, which you?re constantly looking for because here?s the thing: how would you like to be a young corner and now you get bumped to the first level and now you?re playing bump coverage for the majority of the practice? That?s a heck of a challenge. So, just that piece alone is hard on guys but again, I think we?re spreading it around, we?re playing some coverage, we?re doing some things, and really happy with where we?re at, without question.?</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like for your defense to go against Shea Patterson so far?</strong></p>
<p>?Um, good. You know, I love Shea. Shea?s an interesting guy. He?s come in and sat with me and we?ve talked a little bit of coverage and we?ve talked some football. Just really happy he?s here. He?s a tremendous young man, great family, competition?s a beautiful thing, and I expect great things from him.?</p>
<p><strong>What does that say to you when a quarterback comes in and wants to sit with you to dissect a defense?</strong></p>
<p>?He?s got a couple rocks loose. We?re not that sophisticated. I don?t know if you?re supposed to be, but no, we?ve got a nice, quiet relationship on the side and I really enjoy his company.?</p>
<p><strong>What does he bring on the field different than Peters and even McCaffrey?</strong></p>
<p>?Yeah, I don?t really know enough yet so that would be a tough one. Seems very athletic, very mobile, steps in the pocket really well, but the guy to ask would be Pep and Coach Harb[augh]. They?ll tell you all those things. Just as a guy, love the guy.?</p>
<p><strong>What kind of steps has J?Marick Woods taken?</strong></p>
<p>?Ah, vast. I?m surprised I missed him. Rotating with the ones, okay, and doing a very good job in the rotation. We expect him to, like I said, even though he played some, you don?t evaluate freshmen. If you?re evaluating freshmen, you?ve got rocks loose in your head. You?ve gotta give them a chance to breathe, put their feet on the ground, get through this install and the college life and the grind of winter workouts and all those things and see what you got, and I think we?re starting to see what we got there. So, I?m very pleased.?</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Herbert multiple times. Was it obvious soon after he arrived that he was making a pretty big difference?</strong></p>
<p>?Um?yeah. I mean obviously poking my nose in there a little bit and getting to know him on a regular basis and just looking at our guys. Doesn?t take much. Khaleke Hudson, you go, well, he always looks good. He?s strong. Well, now he looks like a muscle. That?s what he is. Devin Bush?s body has changed. I mean, some of the guys that you wouldn?t think?well, how much better can he get in terms of physique and stuff? Those are two examples of guys that I think, you know, they?ve maximized their conditioning and their strength improvement under Ben, and he?s got a great staff, now, too. It?s really good.?</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Devin Bush at the start. Can you explain that a little bit more? You said about his absence and his teammates?</strong></p>
<p>?Ahh, you know, it?s just?he had a personal mishap and he had the chance to go home and nobody would have said a word about it, and those kinds of things, they get left sometimes when people are evaluating a young man and he?s got a strong dad and family and obviously he made the decision to stay here. I mean, I would have?either way was fine with me, but I mean, it?s just?he?s just a different cut of guy. So, it impresses me. And sometimes, everybody?s got an opinion on certain things when it comes to wins and losses. I get all that. But this is a guy that gives you everything he?s got and gives it to his teammates and I think above and beyond, so I just felt it was important to mention.?</p>
<p><strong>Do you watch basketball and do you appreciate defense?</strong></p>
<p>?Oh, oh!?</p>
<p><strong>when a team like Michigan?s playing the kind of defense they are?</strong></p>
<p>?Oof, they?re doing everything. Moe Wagner, the point guard, is it Simmons??</p>
<p><strong>Simpson.</strong></p>
<p>?Yeah, Simpson. Boy, he?s an impressive guy. I remember watching and thinking, <em>Oh, he?s a nice player.</em> He?s a Dude now, you know.?</p>
<p><strong>Is he going to play football this fall too?</strong></p>
<p>?Ah, let?s get him out there. I?m sure Coach would love that. I?m enjoying the ride like everybody else. It?s a great deal, so it?s good.?</p>

<p align="center"><em>[Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<p align="left"><em>[Ed. A- Thanks to Isaiah Hole for sending along video so I could transcribe this, as I wasn?t able to be there due to some medical issues in my family]</em></p>
<p align="left">?How?s everybody doin?? We good? Doin? great. I think. Forty-one years, so?still rollin?. We?re three practices in. Two good ones in no pads. Lot of learning, lot of football being digested. As you know here, that?s what we do. </p>
<p align="left">?Can?t say enough good things about Herb[ert] and the strength staff. Really gave us a really solid group of guys in terms of cardiovascular and bigger, stronger, faster, and just glad to be back with my guys. </p>
<p align="left">?Been doing this a long time. This might be if not the fastest then one of the fastest groups I?ve ever been around, so pretty excited about it. Obviously we?ve got a lot of things to work on but we?ll get there. There?s no question in my mind.?</p>
<p align="left"><strong>With Devin and Khaleke, can you talk about some of those guys that are challenging the other guys at linebacker?</strong></p>
<p align="left">?Well, let me just say this, okay? This Devin Bush Jr.? Special guy now, okay? That?s all I?m gonna say. There?s a private story, but this guy stayed with his team. He could have easily checked out for three or four days and <em>everybody</em> would have understood and he didn?t. So, I think we?re talking about a guy whose character is completely off the charts. </p>
<p align="left">?This Khaleke Hudson is playing at a tremendous level a year ago, and I think he?s a much better cover guy right now. He?s playing at a much faster rate. He should go kiss Ben Herbert on the lips because he?s helped him tremendously.</p>
<p align="left">?This Josh Ross is gonna be a dude. He?s gonna be a really good player. Drew Singleton will be a very good player. Noah Furbush, his arrow is so far up from a year ago. I?m just very excited about where he is. Glasgow, we made the move from Viper behind Khaleke, took the slot coverage off his plate, and that?s helped him improve.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>[I had to split this in the middle of an answer which tells you a lot about the quality of the responses after THE JUMP]</strong></p>

<a name="more"></a><!--break--><!--break--><p align="left">?Up front, Rashan Gary?s, you know, Rashan Gary, you know? He?s a good player. Tremendous player. Chase [Winovich] gives you everything he?s got every single day. This Kwity Paye came in here, I don?t know, probably 235, 236, out of nowhere in Rhode Island, Bishop Hendricken, and he?s 263 right now. He?s like a muscle from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, so, you know, he?s really exceeded expecations. Lo Marhshall?s done a very good job. Aubrey Solomon, you know, sky?s the limit. The guy that was showing great?taking great steps a year ago during the bowl prep was Dwumfour. He hasn?t slowed. I just hope I?m not missing anybody up front, because I really feel very strongly we?ll have seven or eight guys there. I?m glad Lo Marshall?s coming back. Bryan Mone?s playing really well. I don?t know what his weight is, but it?s just so much better distributed throughout his body. Very strong, very physical guy. Let?s make no mistake about it, when he?s in there, he?s in there to do one thing: knock back whoever he?s against and play the run, and when it?s time to do the other things, we?ll figure it out and get somebody else in for him.</p>
<p align="left">?Seondary-wise, if you ask me, the guys that have made the biggest jump: Ambry Thomas has practiced extremely well for three practices. I?m talking jumpers now. You know we?ve got Lavert [Hill] and David Long, Brandon Watson. Those three guys are veteran guys that are playing pretty good, but this Ambry Thomas, now? Different level. Confident. Fast. He ran through on a sweep play?now, again, we were in pajamas the other day, so it?s not a physical thing, it?s just like <em>Wow, that was fast</em>, so happy with him. Jaylen Kelly-Powell, we?ve got him at safety. Really smart football player. Is playing so much better, so those would be the two guys that I would say. Metellus is <em>choooo</em> [mimics a rocket tacking off]. You know, some people were critical of him in the fall. Not me, but some people, but the bottom line for him is he?s taken this offseason as an opportunity to get better. It?s a beautiful thing. Some guys just wallow. He?s taken it and his arrow is completely up and doing a really good job of directing traffic back there.?</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Which of the linebackers are working at that Will spot to replace McCray?</strong></p>
<p>?Well, this Devin Gil? Dude now. Probably if you said to me ?Who?s benefited the most from Ben Herbert?,? he has. He?s faster, he?s bigger, he?s stronger. Smarts was never an issue, and it?s hard to say this but Mike McCray was so damn smart and had such just a good, solid instinct about how the game?s supposed to be played and his fits and you could tell him things week to week and change it one gameplan to another and he was great. This is that kind of guy, <em>except</em> I didn?t know if athletically?if you had asked me a year ago athletically can this guy make it, I would have been <em>eh, I don?t know yet. </em>He can make it.</p>
<p>?It?s he, Josh Ross, and Drew Singleton right now, and obviously we got Jordan [Anthony] and Devin Bush. I?m cross-training one of the guys at Mike and Will and&#160; obviously McGrone will join us in June, so I?m feeling like that?s six guys there. Pretty good dudes. Then you take Uche, who, he?s a package guy but now he?s becoming a linebacker. Played in high school with his hand on the ground. Now all of a sudden he?s doing a much better job in coverage and just playing at a much higher, higher level. He, Furbush, Khalkee, Glasgow, and then I?m kind of bouncing around with personnel groups like we do on third down. Obviously the most important down in college football is the get-off-the-field down, so he?s making a big impact, and we expect him to make a big impact, on third down. Now the question is can he help us on first and second down and I think he?s going that way.?</p>
<p><strong>How have your two early-enrollees looked so far?</strong></p>
<p>?Uh, Myles Sims? Had a big play today. Not out of place. I?m talking about you watch him make a break on the ball and I kind of went <em>Damn, he?s big </em>[holds hands level with the top of his head]. He?s got a ways to go but really happy with the mindset, the demeanor, the confidence level. He?s not afraid, and here he is in our deal lining up close to people and we?re expecting him to perform, which is a big deal. So, really happy with him. Tremendously happy. You asking me about Joe Milton??</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Upshaw.</strong></p>
<p>?Oh, Taylor. Um, good, young, fast, athletic, and willing. We need to get him a couple cheeseburgers and some baked beans and some pizza and he?ll be just fine. We?ve gotta put some meat on his bones but outstanding athlete, quick twitched, fast learner, so we expect big things from him. </p>
<p>?The thing that you have to do is you have to kind of keep it in your head: he?s supposed to be getting ready for the prom this week and he?s here, so that?s a huge advantage, <em>but</em> my mind tells me don?t <em>Don?t evaluate a young man who?s a midyear guy for a year</em>. That?s basically how I try to look at it unless he just jumps off the charts and says <em>I?m gonna make you play me</em>. So, we?ll see, and it?s too early. It?s three days in. They?re sitting in the meeting room as we?re putting in the first install and if I looked at them this would be their expression:</p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1.png"><img title="don brown 1" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="don brown 1" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_thumb.png" width="554" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>?I mean literally. <em>Alright, we?re gonna go baa baa baa and when they give us trips we check this, when they go to four quicks, we do that.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_0.png"><img title="don brown 1" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="don brown 1" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/don-brown-1_thumb_0.png" width="554" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>?So, you know, it?s not an easy proposition for sure, but he?s a smart guy. Dad?s a good guy too, so you can see where he gets it from the football piece. We?re excited to have him for sure.?</p>
<p><strong>Last year you didn?t return a lot of starting experience. You?ve reminded all of us they did play, though. They did come in with some experience. This year you?ve got starting experience and experience. How does that change your expectations of this group?</strong></p>
<p>?You know, all I can tell you is every group?s a new group. Are they going to put the work in all 15, are they gonna cut corners, or are they just gonna grind. Now, every indication that I can give you is our guys are on this plateau going this way [does what looks like airplane taking off with hand]. We?re three practices in and you know how sometimes you can tell, is the room with you or is the room? are there a lot of distractions and a lot of stuff going on? We just don?t have that, so really happy with where we are and got a long way to go, obviously. </p>
<p>?Health is always important in spring because it can create some tough matchups for you, but at the same time you find out if somebody?s going to step up and surprise you, which you?re constantly looking for because here?s the thing: how would you like to be a young corner and now you get bumped to the first level and now you?re playing bump coverage for the majority of the practice? That?s a heck of a challenge. So, just that piece alone is hard on guys but again, I think we?re spreading it around, we?re playing some coverage, we?re doing some things, and really happy with where we?re at, without question.?</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like for your defense to go against Shea Patterson so far?</strong></p>
<p>?Um, good. You know, I love Shea. Shea?s an interesting guy. He?s come in and sat with me and we?ve talked a little bit of coverage and we?ve talked some football. Just really happy he?s here. He?s a tremendous young man, great family, competition?s a beautiful thing, and I expect great things from him.?</p>
<p><strong>What does that say to you when a quarterback comes in and wants to sit with you to dissect a defense?</strong></p>
<p>?He?s got a couple rocks loose. We?re not that sophisticated. I don?t know if you?re supposed to be, but no, we?ve got a nice, quiet relationship on the side and I really enjoy his company.?</p>
<p><strong>What does he bring on the field different than Peters and even McCaffrey?</strong></p>
<p>?Yeah, I don?t really know enough yet so that would be a tough one. Seems very athletic, very mobile, steps in the pocket really well, but the guy to ask would be Pep and Coach Harb[augh]. They?ll tell you all those things. Just as a guy, love the guy.?</p>
<p><strong>What kind of steps has J?Marick Woods taken?</strong></p>
<p>?Ah, vast. I?m surprised I missed him. Rotating with the ones, okay, and doing a very good job in the rotation. We expect him to, like I said, even though he played some, you don?t evaluate freshmen. If you?re evaluating freshmen, you?ve got rocks loose in your head. You?ve gotta give them a chance to breathe, put their feet on the ground, get through this install and the college life and the grind of winter workouts and all those things and see what you got, and I think we?re starting to see what we got there. So, I?m very pleased.?</p>

<p>Final Four! Frozen Four! When to buy? What to buy? How to buy? Any tricks?</p>
<h3>Final Four</h3>
<p>Sorry this is coming out too late to be a part of the volatile part of the market. There was a point when Michigan and Loyola were the only two fanbases who knew they were going to San Antonio, and then prices <a href="https://www.primesport.com/d/ncaa-mens-final-four" target="_blank">shot up from $200 to $250</a> (official ticket exchange) the second Kansas and Nova fans got in (these are after-markup prices). The cheapest ticket to go by since I?ve been tracking this week is $120.</p>
<p>They?re at the high now and should stay that way until a fuzzy point tomorrow when UPS is no longer a good option. This restricts the salability of the tickets and the price starts coming down until gametime. Because of the nature of this beast a huge amount of tickets are bought on the secondary market, and with expensive flights booked there?s a lot of impetus for buyers to buy. Don?t buy at the high.</p>
<p>As the market?s settled down it?s formed into three price tiers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>$I-Don?t-Care:</strong> Premium seats were purchased as soon as they went on sale by brokers looking to capitalize on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of great seats for a Final Four/Championship run. They were bought as session seats and are selling separately. The reasonable ones went right away so all that?s left are $3,000 moonshots that nobody will buy (about 110 seats like that on the market). WAIT on these. They?ll drop as gametime approaches?perhaps down to as little as $600 for Final Four.       </li>
<li><strong>$Good seats:</strong> Once you?ve given up on being down low at half court there?s a middle tier that?s going for about $500 now and should come down to the $400s, but they?re also slowly disappearing from the bottom-up. Behind the basket and corner are the same?it?s just about what someone?s trying to offload. You can also find some club seats in this price level since the Alamodome has a ton of those.       </li>
<li><strong>$Get me in the building:</strong> The cheap seats are all upstairs, either Upper Baseline or Plaza Level. They?re also available as mobile tickets so they?ll be trading right up to the finish line. These are moving at about $200-$250 though there are a bunch listed for more in better rows (saw four for $300 each in row 1 today). Right now you have more options where to sit?wait for a real person to put up a ?sell now? and jump.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that season ticket holders got access to lower bowl seats for $385 face?I noted wryly that a bunch of seats went up for $1,385 on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The rows for the premium seats are a bit weird and you should pay attention so you?re not sold a seat 20 rows higher than it sounded like. Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are what they say on the tin, then it goes A-Z, then AA-QQ, then 20-35. So row ?F? is 10th row, and ?FF? is 36th row, and ?Row 20? is really Row 47. Seating upstairs goes Row 1 to 28.</p>

<p>The 2015 bump is because they dramatically raised the face price?that tends to set the market more than the teams in it.</p>
<p>Which fanbases are in can make a big difference (the 2014-?15 qtys are from when TicketIQ was an official resale partner I think). I don?t pay much attention to ?average? price though that?s what the ticket resellers like to report. Michigan drove the 2013 prices, though that was the first trip in decades in a city filled with Michigan fans. This time I think it?ll be more in line with the Houston numbers?Michigan and Kansas fans are the big travelers in the bunch.</p>
<h3>Championship Game?</h3>
<p>For you Loyola fans, the good news is once you defeat Michigan there should be a lot of Michigan tickets for sale. Prices either drop 25% if the favorites make it in, or 50%+ if they don?t. More data from Ralph:</p>

<p>Again you see when face value went up historically. The big takeaway here is don?t buy ahead?there are going to be some really big Nova or Kansas fans who bought awesome ?both sessions? seats going home and putting these up for what they may. If you can?t get cheaper than what?s available, you can probably get better. Right now those are going in the $300s or $400s. But you can still shop for deals?I found a lower level right now for $357.</p>
<p>Craigslist after the first two sessions will light up like a pinball machine, and that?s a good starting point if you?re in San Antonio and sticking around a few days. WARNING for Craigslisters: the Spurs are one of a handful of teams that now use a terrible app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flash-seats/id679164752?mt=8" target="_blank">Flash Seats</a>; sometimes that?s a good way to ID a real person but the reason they use it is the app has all its protections for the seller and not you. Note that their reviews are either real people with major complaints or good bot reviews.</p>
<p>If you?re in SA, keep in mind this isn?t like the last round, where few people flew in just for the second match. People will go to a championship game who didn?t go to a Final Four. So if you?re on the ground, take advantage by playing the people walking out of the building, and the types who?d love to meet on the way to the airport on Sunday.</p>
<p>This is one of those times when I think your seat does matter. You?re going to remember going to this game (when?s Loyola going back to the national championship game?) and the markup from getting in to getting down isn?t that huge unless you?re trying to sit in the lower bowl. Here?s where waiting to buy championship tickets also helps: if you don?t like your seat in the first game you?ve now had a night to suss out the place. Plus the seats that go on sale will be pretty random, whereas they?re being bought up in order of niceness/price.</p>
<h3>Where the Maize People At?</h3>
<p>Section 113-118 (southwest side) is Michigan?s allotment, so if you?re trying to sit near more Michigan fans your best bets are to sidle around that: 316, 318, 320, etc.</p>
<h3>E-Ticket Situation</h3>
<p>They do exist, but so far they?re a tiny part of the market, and marked up because of convenience.</p>
<h3>Flight Situation</h3>
<p>Flying to San Antonio is going to be a super premium right now. I personally find Texas very drivable despite the long distances?traffic jams up outside the main cities all the time but they?ve got wide and open freeways where the buffalos roamed, and you have to try really hard not to find an amazing barbecue joint en route.</p>
<p>Austin is just an hour and a half away. Corpus Christie is 2 hours. Houston is 3 hours and you go through a city named Flatonia.</p>
<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>The State of Texas (nisi Austin) is a hellscape of pavement with no parking that pays to host national events because that?s what passes for their tourism industry. This goes triple for San Antonio. The Alamodome is just off to the side of San Antonio?s main downtown area, across the freeway from the convention center. So it?s kind of like trying to park in Detroit for a World Series game if you just picture Comerica Park on other side of I-75. There are structures and adjacent lots that will be sold out, some parking lots in not-great neighborhoods behind, and lots and lots of downtown. Here?s <a href="http://www.sanantonio.gov/CCDO/parking/parkingmap" target="_blank">a map of official alternative lots</a>.</p>
<p>There is an Amtrak station just next door but note: the Amtrak station is not the giant beautiful ?Sunset Station? train station. One day maybe I?ll tell you about how I tried to find the train station and wound up crashing an airline magnate?s son?s wedding.</p>
<h3>Frozen Four</h3>
<p>Thinking about making the run to Minneapolis? Tickets are going to be available for about $80-$100 for the ND game (one week from today) and probably drop to the $60s for the championship on Saturday. You?ll spend more getting there than getting in, and it?s a beautiful arena with no bad seats so if you?re going just get in.</p>

<p>Final Four! Frozen Four! When to buy? What to buy? How to buy? Any tricks?</p>
<h3>Final Four</h3>
<p>Sorry this is coming out too late to be a part of the volatile part of the market. There was a point when Michigan and Loyola were the only two fanbases who knew they were going to San Antonio, and then prices <a href="https://www.primesport.com/d/ncaa-mens-final-four" target="_blank">shot up from $200 to $250</a> (official ticket exchange) the second Kansas and Nova fans got in (these are after-markup prices). The cheapest ticket to go by since I?ve been tracking this week is $120.</p>
<p>They?re at the high now and should stay that way until a fuzzy point tomorrow when UPS is no longer a good option. This restricts the salability of the tickets and the price starts coming down until gametime. Because of the nature of this beast a huge amount of tickets are bought on the secondary market, and with expensive flights booked there?s a lot of impetus for buyers to buy. Don?t buy at the high.</p>
<p>As the market?s settled down it?s formed into three price tiers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>$I-Don?t-Care:</strong> Premium seats were purchased as soon as they went on sale by brokers looking to capitalize on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of great seats for a Final Four/Championship run. They were bought as session seats and are selling separately. The reasonable ones went right away so all that?s left are $3,000 moonshots that nobody will buy (about 110 seats like that on the market). WAIT on these. They?ll drop as gametime approaches?perhaps down to as little as $600 for Final Four.       </li>
<li><strong>$Good seats:</strong> Once you?ve given up on being down low at half court there?s a middle tier that?s going for about $500 now and should come down to the $400s, but they?re also slowly disappearing from the bottom-up. Behind the basket and corner are the same?it?s just about what someone?s trying to offload. You can also find some club seats in this price level since the Alamodome has a ton of those.       </li>
<li><strong>$Get me in the building:</strong> The cheap seats are all upstairs, either Upper Baseline or Plaza Level. They?re also available as mobile tickets so they?ll be trading right up to the finish line. These are moving at about $200-$250 though there are a bunch listed for more in better rows (saw four for $300 each in row 1 today). Right now you have more options where to sit?wait for a real person to put up a ?sell now? and jump.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that season ticket holders got access to lower bowl seats for $385 face?I noted wryly that a bunch of seats went up for $1,385 on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The rows for the premium seats are a bit weird and you should pay attention so you?re not sold a seat 20 rows higher than it sounded like. Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are what they say on the tin, then it goes A-Z, then AA-QQ, then 20-35. So row ?F? is 10th row, and ?FF? is 36th row, and ?Row 20? is really Row 47. Seating upstairs goes Row 1 to 28.</p>

<p>The 2015 bump is because they dramatically raised the face price?that tends to set the market more than the teams in it.</p>
<p>Which fanbases are in can make a big difference (the 2014-?15 qtys are from when TicketIQ was an official resale partner I think). I don?t pay much attention to ?average? price though that?s what the ticket resellers like to report. Michigan drove the 2013 prices, though that was the first trip in decades in a city filled with Michigan fans. This time I think it?ll be more in line with the Houston numbers?Michigan and Kansas fans are the big travelers in the bunch.</p>
<h3>Championship Game?</h3>
<p>For you Loyola fans, the good news is once you defeat Michigan there should be a lot of Michigan tickets for sale. Prices either drop 25% if the favorites make it in, or 50%+ if they don?t. More data from Ralph:</p>

<p>Again you see when face value went up historically. The big takeaway here is don?t buy ahead?there are going to be some really big Nova or Kansas fans who bought awesome ?both sessions? seats going home and putting these up for what they may. If you can?t get cheaper than what?s available, you can probably get better. Right now those are going in the $300s or $400s. But you can still shop for deals?I found a lower level right now for $357.</p>
<p>Craigslist after the first two sessions will light up like a pinball machine, and that?s a good starting point if you?re in San Antonio and sticking around a few days.

	<em>even on a bad day, Moe Wagner helps you win. [Patrick Barron]</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Is my memory right that Hamilton played small ball for most of the 2nd half? maybe the last 10 minutes, except for the short period when we saw the Livers-Giant matchup, FSU played w/o a center, didn&rsquo;t they? What a huge change and what a huge credit to Beilein&rsquo;s scheme and fearlessness that Wagner - even cold as ice - scared the s[not] out of Hamilton in the 2nd half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Beilein allows Moe Wagner to shoot his way out of cold stretches for very good reason: he completely changes the way opponents have to approach defense. This is FSU coach Leonard Hamilton <em>after</em> a game in which Wagner went 0-for-7 on threes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure, we did a pretty good job defending him, but I also think the effort that we spent on him, we opened up some opportunities for some other guys, and I think that&#39;s one reason why they were probably a little bit more effective. In order to get to him, being the type of three-point shooter that he is -- I think he shoots over 40% from the floor -- when you&#39;re trying to get to him and he&#39;s a seven-footer, he&#39;s their center, well, obviously, he opens up the lane.</p>
<p>And I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why they were able to get into the interior of our defense and get some easy ups, some high-percentage baskets because we had to put forth so much effort to close out on him because he&#39;s such an outstanding shooter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wagner may have been ice cold but I don&#39;t exactly blame Hamilton for getting deeply uncomfortable with the quality of looks, especially early in the second half. Michigan was successfully going five-out, getting penetration in the paint (mostly by Zavier Simpson), and kicking out to Wagner for achingly open shots. Hamilton would be hard-pressed to bet on Wagner continuing to miss literally all of those shots.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question, your eyes did not deceive you: after combining to play every minute of the first half, FSU&#39;s center trio of Christ Koumadje, Mfiondu Kabengele, and Ike Obiagu played nine combined minutes in the second. Obiagu, who&#39;d emphatically swatted three shots in the opening stanza, didn&#39;t see the floor at all.</p>
<p>Going small, while a viable strategy against Michigan, isn&#39;t really FSU&#39;s game. Using HoopLens data and removing body-bag games, the Noles played over 1400 possessions with at least one center on the floor and under 270 with no center. While their offense improved a bit without a big man hurting their spacing, they went from allowing 46% on two-pointers with a center on the floor to 53% without&mdash;the gap between very good and very bad.</p>
<p>Michigan went 10-for-16 on two-pointers in the second half. After recording seven blocks in the first half, FSU had only two in the second. Even when he&#39;s broke from the perimeter, Wagner changes games.</p>

	The Inbounding Thing Isn&#39;t Really A Thing</h3>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/801/40344205544_0e68ed18b2_b.jpg" style="width: 561px; height: 375px;" /><br />
	<em>this tends to feel more difficult than it is. [Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<blockquote><p>For all his X and O wizardry, why do Beilein teams seem to struggle so regularly with inbounding the ball? Go Blue!</p>
<p>Adam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve probably fielded this question a dozen times over the last couple years.&nbsp;Inbounds plays make up a relatively small percentage of a team&#39;s offense (around 10%) but they get a lot of focus because&nbsp;they become extreme high-stress situations late in games or against pressing teams. Michigan has had the occasional issue getting the ball in (or, like with Isaiah Livers against FSU, not getting trapped once it does) and those instances tend to stick in our minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michigan has struggled to score off inbounds plays this year. Per Synergy, they&#39;re in the 40th percentile in baseline out of bounds plays (BLOBs) and in the 45th percentile in (much less freqently run) sideline out of bounds plays (SLOBs). They&#39;re scoring only 0.83 PPP off BLOB plays with a 44.5 eFG%, which isn&#39;t pretty. That said, however, the thing we often focus on isn&#39;t the problem we believe it is: M turns it over on just 10.6% of such plays, which ranks them 26th nationally.</p>
<p>And what if I told you that Michigan had the #1 BLOB offense in the entire country last year? It&#39;s true! The Wolverines poured in 1.12 PPP on BLOBs in 2016-17 with a healthy gap over the #2 team (UMBC, of all squads). Beilein is very, very capable of drawing up some evil inbounds sets&mdash;ignore the ball and keep your eye on Wagner and MAAR here:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ShadyOpenLark" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Michigan&#39;s efficiency on inbounds plays ties in to their offensive efficiency as a whole, and those plays do tend to exacerbate a certain issue with this particular team: they&#39;re not a great shooting team, especially by Beilein standards, and a lot of inbounds plays come late in the shot clock where you&#39;re going to have to get up a quick jumper. Michigan ranks in the 47th percentile this year in late clock offense (under four seconds on the shot clock) for the same reason.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the inbounding. It&#39;s definitely not the coach. This year, it&#39;s the shooting.</p>

	A Hypothetical I&#39;m Glad Will Stay A Hypothetical</h3>

	<em>a Hall of Fame-level college coach. [Barron]</em></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">thought experiment: Beilein is hired by the Warriors or Rockets, how does he fare? More realistically, given the way the nba game has changed recently why wouldn&rsquo;t the USA men&rsquo;s intl team want to take a look at Coach B?</p>
<p>	&mdash; raj (@internetraj) <a href="https://twitter.com/internetraj/status/978470146254581762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>For a number of reasons, I believe Beilein is much better suited to the college game than the pro game. For one, his offense is so intricate that the adjustment from 30 to 24 seconds on the shot clock would significantly alter how he&#39;d have to approach what he&#39;s best at doing: getting his offense quality shots via the system. He&#39;d also face defenses the likes of which he&#39;s never seen; NBA defensive schemes are so much more advanced&mdash;and so much more effective given the huge size/athleticism gap&mdash;than what you face in college.</p>
<p>His personality is also much better suited to the college game. While the San Antonio Spurs have managed to build a culture like that at Beilein&#39;s Michigan&mdash;tight-knit to the point of operating like a family&mdash;it took a remarkable convergence of ownership, general manager, head coach, and star players to make it work. Beilein is a control freak; in the NBA, the head coach is often the guy with the least amount of control. (See: most anyone who&#39;s coached LeBron James, and this isn&#39;t a shot at Bron.)</p>
<p>While a role with USA Basketball could be more realistic, Beilein is 65 and I don&#39;t see him wanting to add a big job like that. The USA program might want him as an offensive mind but this is a coaching staff with Coach K and Jim Boeheim. A big draw of coaching in that program is the recruiting opportunities it provides. I don&#39;t think I have to say much more to convince you it probably isn&#39;t the right fit for Beilein.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Is my memory right that Hamilton played small ball for most of the 2nd half? maybe the last 10 minutes, except for the short period when we saw the Livers-Giant matchup, FSU played w/o a center, didn&rsquo;t they? What a huge change and what a huge credit to Beilein&rsquo;s scheme and fearlessness that Wagner - even cold as ice - scared the s[not] out of Hamilton in the 2nd half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Beilein allows Moe Wagner to shoot his way out of cold stretches for very good reason: he completely changes the way opponents have to approach defense. This is FSU coach Leonard Hamilton <em>after</em> a game in which Wagner went 0-for-7 on threes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure, we did a pretty good job defending him, but I also think the effort that we spent on him, we opened up some opportunities for some other guys, and I think that&#39;s one reason why they were probably a little bit more effective. In order to get to him, being the type of three-point shooter that he is -- I think he shoots over 40% from the floor -- when you&#39;re trying to get to him and he&#39;s a seven-footer, he&#39;s their center, well, obviously, he opens up the lane.</p>
<p>And I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why they were able to get into the interior of our defense and get some easy ups, some high-percentage baskets because we had to put forth so much effort to close out on him because he&#39;s such an outstanding shooter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wagner may have been ice cold but I don&#39;t exactly blame Hamilton for getting deeply uncomfortable with the quality of looks, especially early in the second half. Michigan was successfully going five-out, getting penetration in the paint (mostly by Zavier Simpson), and kicking out to Wagner for achingly open shots. Hamilton would be hard-pressed to bet on Wagner continuing to miss literally all of those shots.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question, your eyes did not deceive you: after combining to play every minute of the first half, FSU&#39;s center trio of Christ Koumadje, Mfiondu Kabengele, and Ike Obiagu played nine combined minutes in the second. Obiagu, who&#39;d emphatically swatted three shots in the opening stanza, didn&#39;t see the floor at all.</p>
<p>Going small, while a viable strategy against Michigan, isn&#39;t really FSU&#39;s game. Using HoopLens data and removing body-bag games, the Noles played over 1400 possessions with at least one center on the floor and under 270 with no center. While their offense improved a bit without a big man hurting their spacing, they went from allowing 46% on two-pointers with a center on the floor to 53% without&mdash;the gap between very good and very bad.</p>
<p>Michigan went 10-for-16 on two-pointers in the second half. After recording seven blocks in the first half, FSU had only two in the second. Even when he&#39;s broke from the perimeter, Wagner changes games.</p>

	The Inbounding Thing Isn&#39;t Really A Thing</h3>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/801/40344205544_0e68ed18b2_b.jpg" style="width: 561px; height: 375px;" /><br />
	<em>this tends to feel more difficult than it is. [Marc-Gregor Campredon]</em></p>
<blockquote><p>For all his X and O wizardry, why do Beilein teams seem to struggle so regularly with inbounding the ball? Go Blue!</p>
<p>Adam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve probably fielded this question a dozen times over the last couple years.&nbsp;Inbounds plays make up a relatively small percentage of a team&#39;s offense (around 10%) but they get a lot of focus because&nbsp;they become extreme high-stress situations late in games or against pressing teams. Michigan has had the occasional issue getting the ball in (or, like with Isaiah Livers against FSU, not getting trapped once it does) and those instances tend to stick in our minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michigan has struggled to score off inbounds plays this year. Per Synergy, they&#39;re in the 40th percentile in baseline out of bounds plays (BLOBs) and in the 45th percentile in (much less freqently run) sideline out of bounds plays (SLOBs). They&#39;re scoring only 0.83 PPP off BLOB plays with a 44.5 eFG%, which isn&#39;t pretty. That said, however, the thing we often focus on isn&#39;t the problem we believe it is: M turns it over on just 10.6% of such plays, which ranks them 26th nationally.</p>
<p>And what if I told you that Michigan had the #1 BLOB offense in the entire country last year? It&#39;s true! The Wolverines poured in 1.12 PPP on BLOBs in 2016-17 with a healthy gap over the #2 team (UMBC, of all squads). Beilein is very, very capable of drawing up some evil inbounds sets&mdash;ignore the ball and keep your eye on Wagner and MAAR here:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ShadyOpenLark" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Michigan&#39;s efficiency on inbounds plays ties in to their offensive efficiency as a whole, and those plays do tend to exacerbate a certain issue with this particular team: they&#39;re not a great shooting team, especially by Beilein standards, and a lot of inbounds plays come late in the shot clock where you&#39;re going to have to get up a quick jumper. Michigan ranks in the 47th percentile this year in late clock offense (under four seconds on the shot clock) for the same reason.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the inbounding. It&#39;s definitely not the coach. This year, it&#39;s the shooting.</p>
<h3>
	A Hypothetical I&#39;m Glad Will Stay A Hypothetical</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">thought experiment: Beilein is hired by the Warriors or Rockets, how does he fare?

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>For a number of reasons, I believe Beilein is much better suited to the college game than the pro game. For one, his offense is so intricate that the adjustment from 30 to 24 seconds on the shot clock would significantly alter how he&#39;d have to approach what he&#39;s best at doing: getting his offense quality shots via the system. He&#39;d also face defenses the likes of which he&#39;s never seen; NBA defensive schemes are so much more advanced&mdash;and so much more effective given the huge size/athleticism gap&mdash;than what you face in college.</p>
<p>His personality is also much better suited to the college game. While the San Antonio Spurs have managed to build a culture like that at Beilein&#39;s Michigan&mdash;tight-knit to the point of operating like a family&mdash;it took a remarkable convergence of ownership, general manager, head coach, and star players to make it work. Beilein is a control freak; in the NBA, the head coach is often the guy with the least amount of control. (See: most anyone who&#39;s coached LeBron James, and this isn&#39;t a shot at Bron.)</p>
<p>While a role with USA Basketball could be more realistic, Beilein is 65 and I don&#39;t see him wanting to add a big job like that. The USA program might want him as an offensive mind but this is a coaching staff with Coach K and Jim Boeheim. A big draw of coaching in that program is the recruiting opportunities it provides. I don&#39;t think I have to say much more to convince you it probably isn&#39;t the right fit for Beilein.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I've seen NCAA tournament games like Sunday's before: one team gets down, and gets desperate, and dumps all that energy into a relentless pursuit of the puck. Sometimes it's Michigan overturning a 3-0 deficit against Denver to win. Sometimes it's Boston College dominating just about every second despite being down 2-1. Most of the time when this team gets even, they keep going. BC's tying goal in 2004 was game over even if it took overtime. Shots were 45-17 in a game Michigan led the vast majority of. If North Dakota had scored on Shawn Hunwick, that was also game over. </p>
<p>So: Sunday. After about 30 minutes where Michigan had the edge in zone time and staked themselves to a two-goal lead, BU scores on a wraparound, then amps up their forecheck. The ice tilts their direction. When Quinn Hughes isn't on the ice, Michigan barely attempts a controlled zone exit, instead flinging the puck up the boards to BU defensemen. They dump it back in to continue the cycle. The game started to feel like Michigan's recent Big Ten playoff outing against Wisconsin, which this space called Michigan's worst of the year despite the fact that they won it.</p>
<p>And BU scores. They score when Josh Norris flips a pass back to Joe Cecconi in the face of two forecheckers. Cecconi makes a bad situation worse by trying to fling the puck up the slot. Turnover, unchecked guy directly in front of goalie with puck, goal, tie game, game over feeling. </p>
<p>The ensuing three minutes are more of the same; Michigan does not register a shot attempt and BU has a couple of dangerous chances. Then Slaker takes the puck out of the zone?a tiny flag is waved?and gets rubbed out on the boards. This is about the least threatening way hockey players can be configured:</p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_2417.png"><img title="image" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" border="0" alt="image" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_thumb_2380.png" width="564" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>Slaker duly follows up on the defenseman the puck is wandering towards, and then something magical and very very stupid happens. That guy's attempted D to D pass gets caught up in the snow around the bench and turns into a perfect lead pass for Slaker. Horrified, the defenseman explodes in a shower of equipment and collapses to the ground, where he remains even now. Slaker then skates into the slot and shoots a puck off the other defenseman's shin that goes straight into the net. Various larger flags are waved. </p>
<p>That's more or less it. Michigan puts up an insurance marker a bit later but in a game like hockey even when you're playing badly and giving up a bunch of zone time to the opposition, a one goal lead is usually enough with 13 minutes left. They put up a stat at the beginning of the third that Michigan was a brazillion and one when leading after two and BU was 2-6 when trailing.&#160; </p>
<p>Slaker's goal combined with Michigan's second, which bounced off the end boards and behind the goalie directly to Brendan Warren, and the BU wrap-around goal to lend the proceedings the distinct whiff of Barely Weighted Hockey Plinko. This is why it was very exciting to get in the tournament: it's usually pretty random and this year there is no dominant team that threatens to make it less so. The top seed got blown up by Air Force, which is a movie we've seen before. </p>
<p>Once you're there, though? I have to admit that mixed in with the hope and nervousness is a certain nihilism, because of this terrible format and hockey's failure to address the goalie revolution that shot save percentages skyward. I shook my fist at hockey plinko when Northeastern scored to even a game in which Michigan had a 2-to-1 shot advantage, and muttered something positive about it under my breath when Michigan scored on a harmless-looking play to retake the lead. They don't quite even out. </p>
<p>But here they are, no more or less deserving than Carl Hagelin or TJ Hensick or dozens of other Michigan hockey players who had the misfortune to have the puck bounce the wrong way instead of the right way. Cooper Marody, Tony Calderone, and Dexter Dancs wiped out the best line in the country in game one; Quinn Hughes spent the weekend looking like he had rockets in his skates; the team as a whole mercifully stayed out of the box for the vast majority of both games. Insofar as it's possible to earn anything in single elimination hockey, Michigan has earned their way to their first Frozen Four in seven years.</p>
<p>May our continued existence continue to entertain the hockey gods. </p>

<p><strong>This is too random</strong>. Some randomness in a tourney is fun. Without it there's no point in playing. Too much randomness and the format is clearly broken, with annually unsatisfying champions that have no real claim to being the best team. <a href="https://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2018/03/25_No-1-Doesnt-Mean-What-it.php" target="_blank">This is too random</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After going 12-0 against No. 4s in the first three years, No. 1s are 31-21. A No. 4 seed has won at least one game against a No. 1 in each of the last 13 seasons. Since realignment came about, No. 4 seeds have won eight of 12. ?</p>
<p>In the case of those four seeds that became national champions ? Yale in 2013 and Providence in 2015 ? they were the last teams in the tournament. Providence qualified by .0002 RPI points over Bowling Green in 2015. This year, Duluth was the last team in by .0001 points over Minnesota. In any other year, UMD would've been a No. 4 as well. However, BU, Princeton and Michigan Tech winning their conference tournaments changed all of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Air Force turtled against SCSU and got lucky, like they did against Michigan some years back. The prevalence of blocked shots and super high save percentages makes that strategy pay off way too often; the sport should take radical steps to increase scoring, so that individual games are more indicative of who's actually better at doing hockey. </p>
<p><strong>Stayed out of the box!</strong> Four power plays against on the weekend. One fairly badass goal from Northeastern and that's it. Given the margins here any more would have been disastrous. </p>
<p><strong>But it was rough against BU.</strong> Per College Hockey News, Michigan was out-shot-attempted 63-31 at even strength. M helped bridge that gap by blocking almost a third of BU's attempts (19); BU only blocked 6 of Michigan's. Michigan benefited from the randomness this year. Hooray. </p>
<p>I take solace in the fact that Michigan played ND dead even this year and it didn't seem like the Irish were ever able to lock Michigan in their own zone like BU did, even when they trailed in both games of the Michigan sweep.</p>
<p>If Michigan does get OSU that's? sort of okay? 0-5 on the year is far from ideal, but the playoff outing was just about even at 5v5, and even though Michigan was swept in multi-goal games in late January they had huge ES Corsi advantages in both games. (55-31 and 43-23.) I ain't scared of those guys. </p>
<p><strong>Hughes</strong>. Before this season my personal ranking of defensemen I've seen play for Michigan went like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jacob Trouba</li>
<li>Mike Komisarek</li>
<li>Zach Werenski</li>
<li>Jack Johnson</li>
<li>Jon Merrill</li>
</ol>
<p>Hughes is flying up the list despite not even being drafted yet. He's? #3? I think I'd take him over Werenski. His absurd skating nullifies most of his size deficiencies?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Michigan up 3-2 after 2. Quinn Hughes a factor at both ends. Here?s Hughes (5-10, 175) on the PK against Jordan Greenway (6-6, 230). Michigan cleared the zone on this one, too, with Hughes skating it out of trouble.

<p>If Michigan does get OSU that's? sort of okay? 0-5 on the year is far from ideal, but the playoff outing was just about even at 5v5, and even though Michigan was swept in multi-goal games in late January they had huge ES Corsi advantages in both games. (55-31 and 43-23.) I ain't scared of those guys. </p>
<p><strong>Hughes</strong>. Before this season my personal ranking of defensemen I've seen play for Michigan went like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jacob Trouba</li>
<li>Mike Komisarek</li>
<li>Zach Werenski</li>
<li>Jack Johnson</li>
<li>Jon Merrill</li>
</ol>
<p>Hughes is flying up the list despite not even being drafted yet. He's? #3? I think I'd take him over Werenski. His absurd skating nullifies most of his size deficiencies?</p>

<p>Michigan's games this week had little in common with each other. One was a delightful firebombing that was all but over by the second commercial break; the other was a tense defensive chess match. (For a given definition of chess.) Michigan shot a gorillion from three, and then reverted to that bad old Wichita stuff where you might as well hand out blindfolds and cigarettes. Michigan's efficiency stars emerged and then evaporated.</p>
<p>The common thread, such as it was, between both wins: the bricklayers. The guys who have flung free throws at the basket with the smoothness of a man with a basketball lodged in his esophagus attempting to aim a Heimlich maneuver. It was the universal consensus of the Michigan fanbase?both the crazed and somewhat less-than-crazed wings?that the season would end in what-if disappointment when several critical free throws down the stretch hit the underside of the backboard. Zavier Simpson and Charles Matthews would be the likely perpetrators. This was okay-ish in a year that seemed headed for the NIT when Michigan was down 15 to UCLA, but You Just Cannot Win Basketball Games Like That. But we braced for a what-if.</p>
<p>I was amongst these people, and you're lying if you say you weren't, too. When Florida State whittled down a ten point lead into a shot to tie largely thanks to missed front ends, that prophecy loomed almost as large in my mind as &quot;No Scrubs,&quot; which has been a permanent resident since we put it on a podcast a week ago. Even Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman, the laser-eyed hero of the Maryland game, has seemingly contracted the bug. Many thoughts flit back and forth when a very important basketball game is in the balance, and only in the aftermath can you hope to sort out the rational from the paranoid and insane. </p>
<p>In the repose of a Monday, it seems that a good way to win basketball games is to suck at free throws and be up ten anyway. Or 20. 20 is preferable.</p>

<p align="center"><em>[Barron]</em></p>
<p>TJ Starks had no idea. Even afterward, he had no idea. You can maybe forgive a brash statement or two after he put up 21 in an A&amp;M blowout of the defending national champion. Can't expect every 18-year-old point guard's browser to autofill the &quot;enpom.com&quot; after typing in a K. &quot;Unguardable,&quot; he said, in a press conference, and the papers duly printed these words in big letters, because they were bold and silly. </p>
<p>I like to think that Zavier Simpson found out about this because he has a DAMN FOOL OPENS MOUTH Google Alert, but probably one of the student managers sent it to him. I like to think the student manager has a THIS MIGHT ANGER ZAVIER tab folder or instasnap folio or whatever it is the kids are using. This seems far more likely. I like to think that there's one guy on the team that continually shows Simpson tweets from six months ago, and that after TJ Starks had a press conference he fist-pumped and took a two-hour vacation for the first time in a month. </p>
<p>And I like to think that when the student manager showed Simpson the silly quote that he had no reaction except for a slight nostril flare. </p>
<p>A few days later, Starks is holding his own intestines as he asserts that he still feels unguardable. &quot;Do you still feel unguardable?&quot; is kind of a rude question to ask a guy who is holding his own intestines. But ask they do, and Starks answers in the affirmative, and? okay. You know what, actually? As a Michigan fan, thanks. </p>
<p>That went right in the folder. Even after a 38 ORTG, 2/11, 1 assist, 5 TO night during which Simpson set a personal best with six steals?five of which were during the first half blitz that turned the second half into a rote exercise?it went in the folder. Not acknowledging what happened might help you; it certainly causes nostrils to flare. </p>
<p>A couple days later a presumably-still-furious Simpson did (most of) this to FSU's two point guards: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CJ Walker</strong>: 2 points on 4 shot equivalents, 0 assists, 3 TOs, 35 ORTG</li>
<li><strong>Trent Forrest</strong>: 7 points on 8 shot equivalents, 2 A, 2 TO, 89 ORTG</li>
</ul>
<p>Simpson finished his weekend by anticipating a desperate FSU three as the clock ran down and getting his hand on yet another ball, forcing a guy who wasn't even his man into a desperation heave that was nowhere close.</p>
<p>Also he missed a couple free throws.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center">-<a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z.jpg"><img title="40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" border="0" alt="40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z_thumb.jpg" width="564" height="378" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>[Barron]</em></p>
<p>I had no idea. Even afterward: no idea. There were no brash statements about Charles Matthews, really, just assertions that maybe he shouldn't be Michigan's highest-usage player if he's going to turn the ball over buckets?assertions that didn't seem that controversial as Michigan moved usage to Abdur-Rahkman so that he could set New York City alight. But you never know when something's going to click. </p>
<p>So a couple possessions after Charles Matthews got a drive swatted into the crowd by one of A&amp;M's twin towers, he went in again. Up fake, large man jumps into crowd himself, easy finish. From there Matthews took the lead role as Michigan blunted every one of A&amp;M's attempts to get back in the game?or even get it under 20. He drove by the third 6'10&quot; guy, stopped in the lane, and took one of those jumpers where he's eye-to-eye with the rim. He drove through traffic, and put up eight twos that he mostly generated himself, and finished the game with just one turnover. </p>
<p>The resurgence of November Charles Matthews was a B plot in a blowout. It took two days and two minutes for it to pay off. Everyone has a plan until a seven-foot Nigerian comes from the three-point line to block your layup. In the aftermath you might look at the basket like it was suddenly a dangerous thing. Michigan certainly did. Their offense bogged down almost immediately as the shock of Florida State's length settled in. It's one thing to talk about it and practice for it and entirely another when you encounter it for the first time. </p>
<p>Here we should probably use Matthews's full name. Charles Matthews The Kentucky Transfer was the only player Michigan had who was not shocked by Florida State's athleticism. He'd spent a year getting roasted by five stars in Lexington, and knew what it was to go up against five guys with ten guys worth of arms. He kept Michigan afloat in the first half. Hell, he hit his first four free throws to aid the cause. When Leonard Hamilton wondered how his team was down one at the break, answer #1 was &quot;you turned it over 40% of the time&quot;; #2 was Charles Matthews.</p>
<p>After the year in Lexington, Matthews spent a year getting roasted by John Beilein. In the postgame press conference he told a story of how his name during his redshirt year was &quot;Turnover Matthews&quot;; he recalled being told to &quot;touch 212&quot;?ie, run the stairs at Crisler?every practice. Nobody who'd watched him drive with a wince midseason was surprised by that. </p>
<p>Here: two games, 17 two-point attempts, two turnovers total. Seventeen game-saving points in a first-to-55-wins game. No idea. But there it is.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------------------</p>
<p>All year we've been talking about next year, hoping that will be the fusion of Michigan's newfound defensive prowess with the traditional death from above Beilein offense would? uh? get them to the Final Four. As Michigan blitzed through the Big Ten tournament, it became clear this collection of slightly misfit toys was able to outdistance their flaws.</p>
<p>This weekend drove the point home. Michigan's least Beilein players drove Michigan's least Beilein team to San Antonio. They've met halfway. Simpson has a semi-functional three pointer. Matthews has deferred more; has become more responsible with the ball. It was tough to see, for a while, when you've been trained to prize a rain of threes over all else, but it turns out you can use bricks to build something. </p>

<p><strong>[After the jump: the most bonkers stat]</strong></p>

<a name="more"></a><!--break--><!--break--><h3>BULLETS</h3>
<p><strong>The most bonkers stat</strong>. Via <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Once-more-Michigan-basketballs-revamped-defense-saves-the-day-as-Wolverines-make-Final-Four-116664660" target="_blank">Zach Shaw</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After going 12-84 when failing to crack 1.00 points per possession in Beilein?s first 10 seasons, the Wolverines are 7-3 in such games this year, including 3-0 in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find me a stat more bonkers than that. </p>
<p>Also in that article, Beilein's hiring process with Yaklich:</p>
<blockquote><p>?I want a guy that can teach,? Beilein recalled thinking. ?I don't care what you know, if you can't teach it.?</p>
<p>Beilein was more thorough in vetting Yaklich than Donlon ? who had three 20-win seasons as a head coach. He met with Yaklich?s former high school principal, as many of his coworkers with the Redbirds as possible and even asked for practice tapes to see how Yaklich taught things.</p>
<p>It took six weeks, but Beilein eventually made the hire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attention to detail is the basketball program. </p>
<p><strong>Odd call early in the A&amp;M game</strong>. If you were wondering what the weird turnover A&amp;M had just before the first commercial break, it was an out-of-bounds screen. You can't screen a defender while OOB, and the A&amp;M defender had stepped out as MAAR tried to chase his man past him. That's not a foul, it's a violation like carrying or traveling. The oddity of an off-ball non-foul turnover set me a googlin' and that's what I got. </p>
<p><strong>A&amp;M might have kept zoning</strong>. A&amp;M plays a bit of zone and went to it early after Michigan got up 9-4. They didn't get results and went away from it, and then returned for a few possesions, and then yo-yo'd back and forth as they tried to find anything that would work. These were the first few sequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tough midrange jumper from Livers goes off glass and is flukily OREB'd by Michigan after the ball hits Williams in the face, MAAR scramble drill three. </li>
<li>Wide open double clutch elbow jumper from Wagner is a brick. </li>
<li>25-foot semi-contested Robinson 3 gets a friendly roll.</li>
<li>Matthews hits a FT line jumper. </li>
<li>Wagner misses a FT line jumper. </li>
<li>Wagner hits a moderate-heavy contest corner 3.</li>
<li>Simpson misses an open 3. </li>
<li>Simpson drives for a layup as Teske screens the big. </li>
</ul>
<p>That's 2/4 from two and 3/4 from three, but half of those threes were mediocre or bad looks and the OREB that set up a third wasn't the zone's fault. I kind of think that was better than having Tyler Davis try to close out Duncan Robinson and getting smoked so badly that he just watched Robinson lay the ball in?&#160; I've spent a lot of this tournament seeing bricked FT jumpers against 2-3; A&amp;M could have given those up all day and gotten a better defensive result. </p>
<p>I'm probably just thinking about this because I've seen a lot of Duke and Syracuse the past week or so. The slight resurgence of the 2-3 is an interesting development because it asks the opposition to take a lot of midrange jumpers, which everyone hates now and probably get practiced a bunch less than threes. </p>

<p align="center"><em>[Barron]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tough out there for a hero</strong>. Jordan Poole went from the talk of the tournament to a very bit player this weekend. The FSU playing time was fairly self-explanatory: Matthews was playing well and defense was at a premium. Getting yanked for Ibi Watson, and Watson playing more minutes than he had since the Alabama A&amp;M game in December, is another thing entirely. </p>
<p>And it was seemingly all about D. Poole's offensive contribution before he got yanked was a pull-up three after A&amp;M switched on him and an excellent post entry to Wagner. On D he tried a flop when Williams posted on him, getting called for a block and gambled poorly when A&amp;M dumped it down to Williams on the pick and roll and was gone. </p>
<p>That seemed harsh. Poole was not likely to check Williams on the block, so gambling on a call or a steal is reasonable on its face. It must violate Michigan's defensive principles, which probably favor any kind of contest over nothing. I have a hunch that this was a message being sent to Poole about not sniffing his own buzzer-beater. Watson's first defensive possession was a completely blown switch that M got lucky on, a bit later he got beat for a tip-in, and then he fouled a three point shooter. His performance didn't seem any better than Poole's, and yet.</p>
<p><strong>On contesting</strong>. Via <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22914235/why-michigan-loyola-chicago-villanova-kansas-win-national-championship-2018-final-four" target="_blank">bad-reranker Myron Medcalf</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Wolverines also contested 90 percent of FSU's shots, per ESPN Stats &amp; Information data. Think about that. The only Final Four team ranked within the top 10 on KenPom.com in adjusted defensive efficiency challenged nine of every 10 FSU shots.</p>

<p align="center"><em>also: cool hair [Barron]</em></p>
<p><strong>Ike Obiagu, good God</strong>. If Obiagu can develop a modicum of skill he's going to be in the NBA for 15 years. I don't think I've seen someone checking a Wagner pick and pop decide to go block a shot at the rim and do it so authoritatively the ball has yet to return to Earth. Even though his shotblocking presence was crippling Michigan in a tight game it was <em>still sort of fun.</em> I was disappointed when he went to the bench in the second half, sort of. Not really. But sort of! </p>
<p>FSU is going to be fascinating next year?they're applying for a sixth year for Cofer and only lose Angola if that goes through. They only need a little refinement to be a 13-5 ACC team that's a four-seed.</p>
<p><strong>Oh no baby?</strong> Leonard Hamilton started the second half of the FSU game by posting up Christ Koumadje three consecutive times; Koumadje went 1/3 and Michigan got both DREBs, in part because Koumadje was getting D-ed up one on one and wasn't going to rebound a miss. </p>
<p>I thought this was pretty dumb at the time but have come around on it as I think about it a bit more. My halftime theory was that Michigan should drive, pump, and kick to a wide open Wagner; Hamilton probably though that was a pretty good strategy for Michigan as well. Knocking out Wagner with a foul would hamper that. Didn't work; Wagner proceeded to brick all his open threes anyway. </p>
<p><strong>A Tiny Oral History</strong>. ESPN <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22889831/michigan-wolverines-men-college-basketball-walk-makes-bench-go-crazy-3-pointer" target="_blank">dives in on CJ Baird's triple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN, SENIOR GUARD:</strong> I asked him before the game, &quot;If you get in, are you gonna shoot it?&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah, I'm gonna shoot it.&quot; And I asked, &quot;Are you sure? Because a lot of people say that, then they go into the game with a couple seconds left and they're reluctant to shoot the ball.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>BAIRD:</strong> I told my teammates the last couple weeks that if I go in one of these games, I'm going to shoot it. They wanted to see if I would back that up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did, of course, and is now done with avatars for the rest of his life. 90 year old CJ Baird is going to have the same avatar he does today. </p>
<p><strong>Budget for beer</strong>. The <em>Daily's</em> Kevin Santo couldn't get to LA and instead got drunk at Scorekeepers' and wrote about it. It went <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/mens-basketball/sportsmonday-column-san-antonio-ann-arbor-skeeps-bar-scenes" target="_blank">exactly like you'd expect</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>?If Michigan wins, I?m getting a butt tattoo,? he declared. ?Print that.?</p>
<p>He said he wasn?t drunk yet, and offered his uniqname.</p>

<p>I didn't know the kids these days got sloshed on Corona Lights and went around spouting off all the ways they log on. But now I do, thanks to Kevin Santo. </p>

<p>TJ Starks had no idea. Even afterward, he had no idea. You can maybe forgive a brash statement or two after he put up 21 in an A&amp;M blowout of the defending national champion. Can't expect every 18-year-old point guard's browser to autofill the &quot;enpom.com&quot; after typing in a K. &quot;Unguardable,&quot; he said, in a press conference, and the papers duly printed these words in big letters, because they were bold and silly. </p>
<p>I like to think that Zavier Simpson found out about this because he has a DAMN FOOL OPENS MOUTH Google Alert, but probably one of the student managers sent it to him. I like to think the student manager has a THIS MIGHT ANGER ZAVIER tab folder or instasnap folio or whatever it is the kids are using. This seems far more likely. I like to think that there's one guy on the team that continually shows Simpson tweets from six months ago, and that after TJ Starks had a press conference he fist-pumped and took a two-hour vacation for the first time in a month. </p>
<p>And I like to think that when the student manager showed Simpson the silly quote that he had no reaction except for a slight nostril flare. </p>
<p>A few days later, Starks is holding his own intestines as he asserts that he still feels unguardable. &quot;Do you still feel unguardable?&quot; is kind of a rude question to ask a guy who is holding his own intestines. But ask they do, and Starks answers in the affirmative, and? okay. You know what, actually? As a Michigan fan, thanks. </p>
<p>That went right in the folder. Even after a 38 ORTG, 2/11, 1 assist, 5 TO night during which Simpson set a personal best with six steals?five of which were during the first half blitz that turned the second half into a rote exercise?it went in the folder. Not acknowledging what happened might help you; it certainly causes nostrils to flare. </p>
<p>A couple days later a presumably-still-furious Simpson did (most of) this to FSU's two point guards: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CJ Walker</strong>: 2 points on 4 shot equivalents, 0 assists, 3 TOs, 35 ORTG</li>
<li><strong>Trent Forrest</strong>: 7 points on 8 shot equivalents, 2 A, 2 TO, 89 ORTG</li>
</ul>
<p>Simpson finished his weekend by anticipating a desperate FSU three as the clock ran down and getting his hand on yet another ball, forcing a guy who wasn't even his man into a desperation heave that was nowhere close.</p>
<p>Also he missed a couple free throws.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center">-<a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z.jpg"><img title="40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" border="0" alt="40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/40106343435_0d64bfa50b_z_thumb.jpg" width="564" height="378" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>[Barron]</em></p>
<p>I had no idea. Even afterward: no idea. There were no brash statements about Charles Matthews, really, just assertions that maybe he shouldn't be Michigan's highest-usage player if he's going to turn the ball over buckets?assertions that didn't seem that controversial as Michigan moved usage to Abdur-Rahkman so that he could set New York City alight. But you never know when something's going to click. </p>
<p>So a couple possessions after Charles Matthews got a drive swatted into the crowd by one of A&amp;M's twin towers, he went in again. Up fake, large man jumps into crowd himself, easy finish. From there Matthews took the lead role as Michigan blunted every one of A&amp;M's attempts to get back in the game?or even get it under 20. He drove by the third 6'10&quot; guy, stopped in the lane, and took one of those jumpers where he's eye-to-eye with the rim. He drove through traffic, and put up eight twos that he mostly generated himself, and finished the game with just one turnover. </p>
<p>The resurgence of November Charles Matthews was a B plot in a blowout. It took two days and two minutes for it to pay off. Everyone has a plan until a seven-foot Nigerian comes from the three-point line to block your layup. In the aftermath you might look at the basket like it was suddenly a dangerous thing. Michigan certainly did. Their offense bogged down almost immediately as the shock of Florida State's length settled in. It's one thing to talk about it and practice for it and entirely another when you encounter it for the first time. </p>
<p>Here we should probably use Matthews's full name. Charles Matthews The Kentucky Transfer was the only player Michigan had who was not shocked by Florida State's athleticism. He'd spent a year getting roasted by five stars in Lexington, and knew what it was to go up against five guys with ten guys worth of arms. He kept Michigan afloat in the first half. Hell, he hit his first four free throws to aid the cause. When Leonard Hamilton wondered how his team was down one at the break, answer #1 was &quot;you turned it over 40% of the time&quot;; #2 was Charles Matthews.</p>
<p>After the year in Lexington, Matthews spent a year getting roasted by John Beilein. In the postgame press conference he told a story of how his name during his redshirt year was &quot;Turnover Matthews&quot;; he recalled being told to &quot;touch 212&quot;?ie, run the stairs at Crisler?every practice. Nobody who'd watched him drive with a wince midseason was surprised by that. </p>
<p>Here: two games, 17 two-point attempts, two turnovers total. Seventeen game-saving points in a first-to-55-wins game. No idea. But there it is.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------------------</p>
<p>All year we've been talking about next year, hoping that will be the fusion of Michigan's newfound defensive prowess with the traditional death from above Beilein offense would? uh? get them to the Final Four. As Michigan blitzed through the Big Ten tournament, it became clear this collection of slightly misfit toys was able to outdistance their flaws.</p>
<p>This weekend drove the point home. Michigan's least Beilein players drove Michigan's least Beilein team to San Antonio. They've met halfway. Simpson has a semi-functional three pointer. Matthews has deferred more; has become more responsible with the ball. It was tough to see, for a while, when you've been trained to prize a rain of threes over all else, but it turns out you can use bricks to build something. </p>

<p><strong>[After the jump: the most bonkers stat]</strong></p>

<a name="more"></a><!--break--><!--break--><h3>BULLETS</h3>
<p><strong>The most bonkers stat</strong>. Via <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Once-more-Michigan-basketballs-revamped-defense-saves-the-day-as-Wolverines-make-Final-Four-116664660" target="_blank">Zach Shaw</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After going 12-84 when failing to crack 1.00 points per possession in Beilein?s first 10 seasons, the Wolverines are 7-3 in such games this year, including 3-0 in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find me a stat more bonkers than that. </p>
<p>Also in that article, Beilein's hiring process with Yaklich:</p>
<blockquote><p>?I want a guy that can teach,? Beilein recalled thinking. ?I don't care what you know, if you can't teach it.?</p>
<p>Beilein was more thorough in vetting Yaklich than Donlon ? who had three 20-win seasons as a head coach. He met with Yaklich?s former high school principal, as many of his coworkers with the Redbirds as possible and even asked for practice tapes to see how Yaklich taught things.</p>
<p>It took six weeks, but Beilein eventually made the hire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attention to detail is the basketball program. </p>
<p><strong>Odd call early in the A&amp;M game</strong>. If you were wondering what the weird turnover A&amp;M had just before the first commercial break, it was an out-of-bounds screen. You can't screen a defender while OOB, and the A&amp;M defender had stepped out as MAAR tried to chase his man past him. That's not a foul, it's a violation like carrying or traveling. The oddity of an off-ball non-foul turnover set me a googlin' and that's what I got. </p>
<p><strong>A&amp;M might have kept zoning</strong>. A&amp;M plays a bit of zone and went to it early after Michigan got up 9-4. They didn't get results and went away from it, and then returned for a few possesions, and then yo-yo'd back and forth as they tried to find anything that would work. These were the first few sequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tough midrange jumper from Livers goes off glass and is flukily OREB'd by Michigan after the ball hits Williams in the face, MAAR scramble drill three. </li>
<li>Wide open double clutch elbow jumper from Wagner is a brick. </li>
<li>25-foot semi-contested Robinson 3 gets a friendly roll.</li>
<li>Matthews hits a FT line jumper. </li>
<li>Wagner misses a FT line jumper. </li>
<li>Wagner hits a moderate-heavy contest corner 3.</li>
<li>Simpson misses an open 3. </li>
<li>Simpson drives for a layup as Teske screens the big. </li>
</ul>
<p>That's 2/4 from two and 3/4 from three, but half of those threes were mediocre or bad looks and the OREB that set up a third wasn't the zone's fault. I kind of think that was better than having Tyler Davis try to close out Duncan Robinson and getting smoked so badly that he just watched Robinson lay the ball in?&#160; I've spent a lot of this tournament seeing bricked FT jumpers against 2-3; A&amp;M could have given those up all day and gotten a better defensive result. </p>
<p>I'm probably just thinking about this because I've seen a lot of Duke and Syracuse the past week or so. The slight resurgence of the 2-3 is an interesting development because it asks the opposition to take a lot of midrange jumpers, which everyone hates now and probably get practiced a bunch less than threes. </p>

<p align="center"><em>[Barron]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tough out there for a hero</strong>. Jordan Poole went from the talk of the tournament to a very bit player this weekend. The FSU playing time was fairly self-explanatory: Matthews was playing well and defense was at a premium. Getting yanked for Ibi Watson, and Watson playing more minutes than he had since the Alabama A&amp;M game in December, is another thing entirely. </p>
<p>And it was seemingly all about D. Poole's offensive contribution before he got yanked was a pull-up three after A&amp;M switched on him and an excellent post entry to Wagner. On D he tried a flop when Williams posted on him, getting called for a block and gambled poorly when A&amp;M dumped it down to Williams on the pick and roll and was gone. </p>
<p>That seemed harsh. Poole was not likely to check Williams on the block, so gambling on a call or a steal is reasonable on its face. It must violate Michigan's defensive principles, which probably favor any kind of contest over nothing. I have a hunch that this was a message being sent to Poole about not sniffing his own buzzer-beater. Watson's first defensive possession was a completely blown switch that M got lucky on, a bit later he got beat for a tip-in, and then he fouled a three point shooter. His performance didn't seem any better than Poole's, and yet.</p>
<p><strong>On contesting</strong>. Via <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22914235/why-michigan-loyola-chicago-villanova-kansas-win-national-championship-2018-final-four" target="_blank">bad-reranker Myron Medcalf</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Wolverines also contested 90 percent of FSU's shots, per ESPN Stats &amp; Information data. Think about that. The only Final Four team ranked within the top 10 on KenPom.com in adjusted defensive efficiency challenged nine of every 10 FSU shots.</p>

<p align="center"><em>also: cool hair [Barron]</em></p>
<p><strong>Ike Obiagu, good God</strong>. If Obiagu can develop a modicum of skill he's going to be in the NBA for 15 years. I don't think I've seen someone checking a Wagner pick and pop decide to go block a shot at the rim and do it so authoritatively the ball has yet to return to Earth. Even though his shotblocking presence was crippling Michigan in a tight game it was <em>still sort of fun.</em> I was disappointed when he went to the bench in the second half, sort of. Not really. But sort of! </p>
<p>FSU is going to be fascinating next year?they're applying for a sixth year for Cofer and only lose Angola if that goes through. They only need a little refinement to be a 13-5 ACC team that's a four-seed.</p>
<p><strong>Oh no baby?</strong> Leonard Hamilton started the second half of the FSU game by posting up Christ Koumadje three consecutive times; Koumadje went 1/3 and Michigan got both DREBs, in part because Koumadje was getting D-ed up one on one and wasn't going to rebound a miss. </p>
<p>I thought this was pretty dumb at the time but have come around on it as I think about it a bit more. My halftime theory was that Michigan should drive, pump, and kick to a wide open Wagner; Hamilton probably though that was a pretty good strategy for Michigan as well. Knocking out Wagner with a foul would hamper that. Didn't work; Wagner proceeded to brick all his open threes anyway. </p>
<p><strong>A Tiny Oral History</strong>. ESPN <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22889831/michigan-wolverines-men-college-basketball-walk-makes-bench-go-crazy-3-pointer" target="_blank">dives in on CJ Baird's triple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN, SENIOR GUARD:</strong> I asked him before the game, &quot;If you get in, are you gonna shoot it?&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah, I'm gonna shoot it.&quot; And I asked, &quot;Are you sure? Because a lot of people say that, then they go into the game with a couple seconds left and they're reluctant to shoot the ball.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>BAIRD:</strong> I told my teammates the last couple weeks that if I go in one of these games, I'm going to shoot it. They wanted to see if I would back that up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did, of course, and is now done with avatars for the rest of his life. 90 year old CJ Baird is going to have the same avatar he does today. </p>
<p><strong>Budget for beer</strong>. The <em>Daily's</em> Kevin Santo couldn't get to LA and instead got drunk at Scorekeepers' and wrote about it. It went <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/mens-basketball/sportsmonday-column-san-antonio-ann-arbor-skeeps-bar-scenes" target="_blank">exactly like you'd expect</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>?If Michigan wins, I?m getting a butt tattoo,? he declared. ?Print that.?</p>
<p>He said he wasn?t drunk yet, and offered his uniqname.</p>

<p>I didn't know the kids these days got sloshed on Corona Lights and went around spouting off all the ways they log on. But now I do, thanks to Kevin Santo. </p>

<p align="center"><em>REMEMBER US?!?!? [Patrick Barron]</em></p>
<p>Apologies to everyone for interrupting your hoops and hockey tournament coverage but Michigan football&rsquo;s spring practice got underway on Friday, and a few things have happened or were said to be happening with that other sport some of us still follow. If you&rsquo;ve been kind of tuned out since the derpy bowl game I&rsquo;ve tried to compile the most important bits we&rsquo;ve learned since into this post.</p>
<p>By the way <strong>AZBlue </strong>wrote an excellent distillation of <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/diaries/prespring-football-updates-sam-webb" target="_blank">things Sam&rsquo;s been putting out on the radio</a>. I&rsquo;ve bumped that to the diaries. Let&rsquo;s go by position I guess:</p>
<h3>
	Quarterbacks</h3>
<p align="left"><em>Gone: Wilton Speight, John O&rsquo;Korn, Alex Malzone.<br />
	Off redshirt: Dylan McCaffrey<br />
	<em>N<em>ew faces: Shea Patterson, Joe Milton.</em></em></em></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_2410.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="450" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_thumb_2373.png" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" width="564" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>North! North I say! [Bryan Fuller]</em></p>
<p><strong>Shea Patterson</strong>&rsquo;s eligibility <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/unverified-voracity-waiting-package" target="_blank">is held up for the moment</a> (scroll down about half-way) because Ole Miss is going to be petty. They have Patterson&rsquo;s reportedly ironclad case to be freed of sitting out a transfer year, but they don&rsquo;t have to respond until 10 days after the ??? days it takes the NCAA to send a hard copy to Oxford of the same thing Michigan sent.</p>
<p>Harbaugh said the coaches are still treating it like a three-way race between Patterson, Peters, and McCaffrey, with snaps split equally. <strong>Joe Milton</strong> is on campus and impressing in his preparation but a redshirt is most likely.</p>
<p align="center">--------------------</p>
<h3>
	Running Back</h3>
<p><em>Gone: Ty Isaac<br />
	Off redshirt: Kurt Taylor<br />
	<em>Arrive in fall<em>: Christian Turner, Michael Barrett, Hassan Haskins</em></em></em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more or less the same depth chart as it&rsquo;s been since Isaac&rsquo;s injury last year. That is your co-starters remain <strong>Karan Higdon</strong> and <strong>Chris Evans</strong>, with <strong>Kareem Walker</strong> and <strong>O&rsquo;Maury Samuels</strong> in competition for two hundred-odd carries behind them. Sam <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Previewing-Michigan-Footballs-running-back-position-in-Spring-practice-2018-116522427" target="_blank">spoke with RBs coach Jay Harbaugh</a> who mentioned Karan Higdon&rsquo;s growth at running the counter cutbacks that <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/neck-sharpies-back-side-power" target="_blank">we wrote about last year</a>. The incoming freshmen were mentioned with the walk-ons, so I&rsquo;m reading that as a four-man stable for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>[after THE JUMP: the rest]</strong></p>

<a name="more"></a><!--break--><!--break--><p align="center">--------------------</p>
<h3>
	Offensive Line</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>Gone: LT Mason Cole, OC Patrick Kugler, Ja&rsquo;Raymond Hall<br />
	Off redshirt: Chuck Filiaga, Andrew Steuber, Joel Honigford, Grant Newsome?<br />
	Arrive in fall: Jalen Mayfield, Ryan Hayes </em></p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am.png"><em><img alt="pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am" border="0" height="319" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am_thumb.png" title="pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am" width="564" /></em></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>I thought of the nicest thing I could [via me]</em></p>
<p>Six offensive linemen return who started last year, however among them only <strong>Ben Bredeson</strong>, <strong>Mike Onwenu</strong>, and <strong>Cesar Ruiz</strong> appear likely to start on this year&rsquo;s line. Via Harbaugh, <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">Ruiz is has made the transition to center</a> and might be the best player this year on the line. Various offseason chatter had <strong>Andrew Vastardis </strong>and <strong>Stephen Spanellis </strong>also in competition for graduated Patrick Kugler&rsquo;s job but your three no-redshirt guys are mostly likely your starting interior.</p>
<p>Outside it&rsquo;s still a mess. Despite a world-class Rubik&rsquo;s Cube culture, Michigan did not get the Rice OT transfer Calvin Anderson, so it&rsquo;s back to last year&rsquo;s material plus a year and new coaches. <strong>James Hudson</strong>, who moved from DT last year,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>gets mentioned the most often by coaches&mdash;hopefully that means they&rsquo;ve found a solid four-year starter. Of the rest of the 2017 haul, <strong>Chuck Filiaga </strong>gets the most mention; <strong>Andrew Stueber</strong> and Joel Honigford were mentioned among the guards. Max Bultman of The Athletic had <a href="https://theathletic.com//286645/2018/03/24/four-key-storylines-as-michigan-football-opens-camp/?redirected=1" target="_blank">a &ldquo;four key storlines&rdquo; article</a>($) that of course mentioned the tackles but got the problem backwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harbaugh rattled off some names he felt good about &mdash; Juwann Bushell-Beatty, Jon Runyan, Chuck Filiaga and James Hudson &mdash; but this feels like a group where you want two guys to really emerge. After last season, the skeptics won&rsquo;t go quiet until the starters, at the very least, are moving the bodies across from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving bodies in the run game wasn&rsquo;t the problem; pass protection was.</p>
<p>The other three sometime starters, <strong>Nolan Ulizio</strong>, <strong>Juwann Bushell-Beatty</strong>, and <strong>Jon Runyan Jr</strong>. all saw time at right tackle last year, but none lead for either open job. Ulizio doesn&rsquo;t even get mentioned. I have a hunch that Runyan&rsquo;s still the fallback option if none of the rolls above hit, and JBB&rsquo;s a better option than we&rsquo;re giving him credit for.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Grant Newsome </strong>Lives<strong>&rdquo; </strong>articles peppered the offseason, and there&rsquo;s nobody I&rsquo;d like to see back on the field more, <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">but as of Friday</a>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Is Grant Newsome able to practice yet?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>He can do anything with the team right now?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working out, he&rsquo;s conditioning, but he&rsquo;s not at the point to come back and practice with the team.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;hope is still just that. I did a double-take last week when Newsome announced on Twitter he had been accepted to grad school at &ldquo;Ford&rdquo; before realizing he meant the Michigan School for Public Policy. Odds of Newsome solving this year&rsquo;s left tackle situation remain about the same as Newsome becoming President of the United States one day, i.e. ~25%.</p>
<p>Gun to head, the OL from left to right is Hudson-Bredeson-Ruiz-Onewnu-[Ask again in fall] and President Newsome wins his 2044 reelection in a landside.</p>

Haven&rsquo;t heard much on the &ldquo;move&rdquo; tight end position except for <strong>Nick Eubanks</strong> getting as much mention as McKeon and Gentry. Presume progress. <strong>Ben Mason </strong>named one of the most vocal guys on the team with Devin Bush, Chase Winovich and Rashan Gary. <strong>Jared Wangler</strong> has moved to fullback.</p>

Add the return of <strong>Tarik Black</strong>, who could have played in the bowl game if they didn&rsquo;t want to waste a medshirt, and that 2017 class should feature prominently this year.</p>

<p align="center"><em>rejected cover for this year&rsquo;s book by MonuMental</em></p>
<p>The starters are no surprise: Chase and Gary on the weak and strong sides, and in the middle is a continuation of the rotation of <strong>Aubrey Solomon/Bryan Mone</strong> at nose and <strong>Michael Dwumfour</strong> taking over Hurst&rsquo;s job. Sam notes Mone has come far, dropping weight and healing well.</p>
<p>Three different coaches <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Hes-Ready-to-Take-the-Next-Step-116302299?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">told Sam Webb</a>($) that <strong>Michael Dwumfour</strong> is going to be, well not Mo Hurst but a worthy successor to Mo Hurst&rsquo;s job, with Mattison going so far to say &ldquo;He has got that first and second step that Mo had.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s up to 295 and no longer slowed by injury.</p>
<p>The award for most hyped backup (not including NT rotation) goes to <strong>Kwity Paye</strong>, who is up to 256 pounds from the 235 sopping wet he played at last year. The other two guys in the rotation are <strong>Lawrence Marshall</strong>, Carlo Kemp (see below), and <strong>Deron Irving-Bey</strong>, who&rsquo;s up to 300 and backing up at interior. <strong>Taylor Upshaw</strong> is on campus and impressed with his speed.</p>
<p><strong>Carlo Kemp</strong> is another guy who&rsquo;s coming up unbidden in coach conversations. Kemp is up near 280, and one-arm lifting dumbells that weigh as much as the starting corners. The coaches are <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Three-Winter-Conditioning-Transformations-116266117?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">considering using him inside</a>. That probably says more about the depth after the three DT starters, though that&rsquo;s not much of a concern considering there&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p><strong>Jeter</strong> and <strong>Vilain</strong> are still recovering from last year&rsquo;s injuries. Paea is practicing at DT. Nothing about RoJo.</p>
<p>Rashan Gary might be <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/mgoboard/rashan-wear-98" target="_blank">wearing #98</a> this spring. On good authority Michigan dumped the Legends Jersey program because Harbaugh made it one of his points for taking the job. The old rules are presumably back in play, which were you had to be a family member or direct descendent to wear a retired number (in Crisler there&rsquo;s a display of several athletes doing so). If the Harmons are okay I don&rsquo;t see an issue, but wild guess: it&rsquo;s just a spring fling.</p>

<p><em>Gone: Mike McCray, Elysee Mbem-Bosse, Mike Wroblewski<br />
	Off redshirt: Jordan Anthony, Joshua Ross, Drew Singleton<br />

<p align="center"><em>Hello backfield my old friend. [Fuller]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just block-quoting AZBlue&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/diaries/prespring-football-updates-sam-webb" target="_blank">now-a-diary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LBs - Don Brown sounded almost giddy when talking about this.&nbsp; I believe the quote was &quot;I am going to just sit back grinning like a Cheshire cat watching the competition.&nbsp; Has never had a group like this.&nbsp; Depth chart sounds like MLB - Bush, Anthony, Singleton WLB - Gil/Ross battle and Singleton.&nbsp; Viper - Hudson and Glasgow with Furbush and Uche in the more traditional SAM role.&nbsp; Singleton (as seen above) will get time at MLB and WLB to find him a place on the field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Devin Bush Jr.</strong> hype translated into all-B1Gish play last year so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the coaches are raving about him still. Sam stayed on Don Brown about Singleton and got back a &ldquo;Yes! He and Josh Ross&hellip;&rdquo; answer, and <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Three-Winter-Conditioning-Transformations-116266117?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">something about nutrition</a>($), FWIW. It is nice to hear the good Dr. Blitz isn&rsquo;t sweating the rest of the depth chart, since we barely saw any of them last year except for some Devin Gil (and Sam but I&rsquo;m talking about the Mike and Will spots). <strong>Josh Ross </strong>has a slim lead on Gil as next WLB starter, and <strong>Jordan Anthony </strong>is coming on as Bush&rsquo;s understudy, and the coaches will rotate in <strong>Drew Singleton </strong>at both spots because they want him on the field. Michigan might have had a shot at getting Mike McCray a 6th year; I choose to take the fact that they didn&rsquo;t look into it as evidence they&rsquo;re not worried about what they&rsquo;ve seen in practice.</p>
<p>Your traditional SAMs remain <strong>Noah Furbush</strong> and <strong>Josh Uche</strong>, though they still have slightly different roles.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Mason </strong>is at fullback but may come back and play some MLB as well.</p>

<p>Steve Lorenz posted <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Michigan-defensive-coordinator-Don-Brown-and-safeties-coach-Chris-Partridge-break-down-Michigan-Football-safeties-in-2018-116554650/Amp?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">an interview with Don Brown and Chris Partridge</a> that had a ton of information about all the positions, as well as Brown&rsquo;s thoughts on &ldquo;havoc rate&rdquo; (spoiler: he likes to cause it). It also gave a fairly specific rundown of the state of the safety depth chart. <strong>Tyree Kinnel </strong>remains locked in at the free safety position, and is by far the most advanced at getting the defense set and adjusted to motions, etc.</p>
<p>But the coaches are really high on Tyree&rsquo;s top backup, <strong>Jaylen Kelly-Powell</strong>, who&rsquo;s getting to play safety full time after bouncing between that and cornerback and nickel last year. He&rsquo;s no longer a stick.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Metellus </strong>however appears to be in a wide open competition for his Rover job, with <strong>Ja&rsquo;Marick Woods </strong>the main challenger, and <strong>Brad Hawkins</strong>, traded back from Viper, charging up from behind <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Michigan-defensive-coordinator-Don-Brown-and-safeties-coach-Chris-Partridge-break-down-Michigan-Football-safeties-in-2018-116554650/Amp?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">with tantalizing upside</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have <b><a href="https://247sports.com/Player/Brad-Hawkins-46483">Brad Hawkins</a></b>. That&rsquo;s my guy,&quot; [Partridge] said of the former Camden (NJ) star. &quot;I think that&rsquo;s a great move (to move him back). He&rsquo;s a natural cover guy. We have to get him moving along on learning both spots. He had a really eye-opening year practicing at VIPER and it&rsquo;s going to make him a much better safety.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Viper spot remains Khaleke Hudson&rsquo;s; <strong>Jordan Glasgow</strong> was the man traded for Hawkins. The traditional SAM job is covered in the linebackers.</p>

<p><em>Gone: Tim Drevno (OC), Greg Frey (OL), Brian Smith (safeties), Kevin Tolbert (S&amp;C)<br />

<p><em><em><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_2414.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="358" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_thumb_2377.png" style="margin: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" width="564" /></a></em></em></p>
<p>A lot of new faces in the program, in and out of the official coaching ranks.</p>
<p>Offense saw the most movement. Erstwhile OTs/TEs coach Greg Frey joined FSU (his alma mater) and they very gingerly removed Drevno. This year the NCAA begins allowing a 9th paid assistant, which they also spent on O.</p>
<p>Those additions: tight ends coach <strong>Sherrone Moore</strong>, OL guru <strong>Ed Warinner</strong>, and WRs coach <strong>Jim McElwain</strong>. <strong>Moore</strong> was at CMU and is a hot up-and-comer who should give Michigan a few good years of value as a coach and recruiter en route to an OC/HC career. <strong>Warinner</strong>, whose son is a walk-on at State, built the good early Urban OLs until he was Peters Principled to OC. <strong>McElwain</strong>&hellip;is a former SEC coach who might be an upgrade over a disinterested Pep and grad assistants in training the young receivers corps. His Florida career suggests he&rsquo;s not much of a recruiter and should be kept away from offensive strategy (and sharks) at all costs. They&rsquo;ve also brought back <strong>Roy Roundtree</strong> as a ballyhooed grad assistant.</p>
<p>Nobody has been named offensive coordinator. Harbaugh claims it&rsquo;s a collaborative effort, and noted Bo never had an OC*. In reality the OC is Harbaugh and will be Harbaugh.</p>
<p>Defensively they&rsquo;ve brought in <strong>Al Washington</strong>, another Don Brown acolyte, to replace Don Brown acolyte Brian Smith. Washington has coached all over the place, mostly special teams and DL, and is listed as a &ldquo;defensive assistant coach.&rdquo; My guess is he&rsquo;ll be working with the young outside linemen and outside (Sam) linebackers. <strong>Chris Partridge</strong> moved back to help in the secondary&mdash;fortunately with Michael Zordich still around and Devin Bush Sr. back as a secondary analyst.</p>
<p>New strength coach <strong>Ben Herbert</strong>, who did his best work building Wisconsin&rsquo;s meat grinders, is <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Former-Arkansas-offensive-lineman-Frank-Ragnow-breaks-down-Michigan-strength-and-conditioning-coach-Ben-Herbert-113402231" target="_blank">working more on core strength</a>; his predecessor apparently leaned more toward conditioning.</p>
<p><em>* [De jure this is true, at least until Moeller was named offensive coordinator shortly before Bo&rsquo;s retirement. Via Dr. Sap&rsquo;s interview with Jerry Hanlon in 2015 HTTV however it&rsquo;s clear that the little line coach was offensive coordinator in all but title&mdash;and he definitely wanted that title!]</em></p>

<h3>
	Simplified Offense and RPOs!</h3>
<p align="center"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmScholarlyGuanaco?autoplay=0" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p align="center"><em>I think this was an RPO: if the SAM stays in the box O&rsquo;Korn throws the Evans bubble, otherwise it&rsquo;s a Higdon backside fold that makes the frontside DE think he&rsquo;s getting optioned.</em></p>
<p>A big theme of this offseason has been Harbaugh&rsquo;s mea culpa for last year&rsquo;s offensive problems. Coach told Sam Webb on the radio that he probably <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-didnt-mince-words-about-some-of-the-problems-that-ailed-Michigans-offense-last-season-116237864" target="_blank">put too much on their plates</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>And then identifying what we do offensively. Some of that is getting really good at the things we&#39;re good at and what our personnel fits. There will be less volume to (the offense). I felt like there were times where we would put things in and then run them in the game, but the players hadn&#39;t practiced it enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just went through the film of the Ohio State game this weekend and 1) Yes, and 2) Michigan kept the Buckeyes off balance all game by seesawing between completely different looks. At the end of the 1st quarter they ran an inside zone off an Ace-11 look. Next down after the quarter break they came out in an unbalanced goal line formation and sprung McKeon for a worst-waldo TD.</p>
<p>The shifting identity throughout the season was a more serious issue. That was somewhat unavoidable due to quarterback injuries, and also self-inflicted. After an offseason of Pep-style let-Speight-read-five-guys-in-a-pattern and Frey-style zone running, they chose Ulizio for RT at the last minute even though he couldn&rsquo;t pass block. Unable to protect Speight, they nerfed his reads dramatically vs Purdue, and then he went down. Then it was super-simplified for O&rsquo;Korn through PSU. After that they scrapped the zone, inserted JBB at RT, and ran manball with Brandon Peters under center until Wisconsin knocked him out. By Ohio State (with Runyan now at RT) this had devolved to a grab-bag of gimmicks; the bowl game was a clown show.</p>
<p>Harbaugh <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-didnt-mince-words-about-some-of-the-problems-that-ailed-Michigans-offense-last-season-116237864" target="_blank">sat down with Sam last week</a> and said the moment he knew the passing game was in trouble was Speight&rsquo;s first interception against Florida:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&#39;ll give you a real specific when it comes to training up the quarterbacks. I felt like where I made just a huge mistake was training in the offseason,&rdquo; Harbaugh admitted. &ldquo;In the spring practices and the training camp we go against our defense. It&#39;s offense against defense&hellip; one&#39;s against one&#39;s. We really did that exclusively in spring ball and a good 10 days or so into training camp. Our defense is different. They play a lot of cover one&hellip; a lot of press man&hellip; But I didn&#39;t feel like we showed them enough looks from the quarters, (or) enough looks from quarter-quarter-half, (or) enough looks of zone blitz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hit me way too late&hellip; during the first half of the Florida game. Wilton was throwing a dig over the middle about 16 to 18 yards, and he threw it high and it got intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Right there I am standing on the sidelines going, &lsquo;this is what he&#39;s done for the last six months&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s interview with Harbaugh and another with Pep Hamilton &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; that run-pass options <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-says-run-pass-option-plays-will-be-a-part-of-the-attack-plan-moving-forward-116495951?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">will definitely be part of the offense</a>. I&rsquo;m doing an HTTV article on this right now and I&rsquo;ll spoil the ending to save you some hyperventilation: Michigan already runs them, has been running them, and probably isn&rsquo;t going to run them that much more than they did against Ohio State (three to five times a game). Harbaugh on <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">at the Friday presser</a> needed a reminder:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You talked to The Michigan Insider [and said] that you were going to implement more RPO, you were looking into it and you were going to implement more RPO. Maybe not overhaul completely, but&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who at The Michigan Insider?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Sam Webb.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. [chuckles] We&rsquo;re studying our offense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al Borges ran RPOs at Michigan too. They work within your offense, but over half the time an announcer is exclaiming &ldquo;RPO!&rdquo; it&rsquo;s probably just a run-of-the-mill play-action pass.</p>

<p align="center"><em>REMEMBER US?!?!? [Patrick Barron]</em></p>
<p>Apologies to everyone for interrupting your hoops and hockey tournament coverage but Michigan football&rsquo;s spring practice got underway on Friday, and a few things have happened or were said to be happening with that other sport some of us still follow. If you&rsquo;ve been kind of tuned out since the derpy bowl game I&rsquo;ve tried to compile the most important bits we&rsquo;ve learned since into this post.</p>
<p>By the way <strong>AZBlue </strong>wrote an excellent distillation of <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/diaries/prespring-football-updates-sam-webb" target="_blank">things Sam&rsquo;s been putting out on the radio</a>. I&rsquo;ve bumped that to the diaries. Let&rsquo;s go by position I guess:</p>
<h3>
	Quarterbacks</h3>
<p align="left"><em>Gone: Wilton Speight, John O&rsquo;Korn, Alex Malzone.<br />
	Off redshirt: Dylan McCaffrey<br />
	<em>N<em>ew faces: Shea Patterson, Joe Milton.</em></em></em></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_2410.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="450" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/image_thumb_2373.png" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" width="564" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>North! North I say! [Bryan Fuller]</em></p>
<p><strong>Shea Patterson</strong>&rsquo;s eligibility <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/unverified-voracity-waiting-package" target="_blank">is held up for the moment</a> (scroll down about half-way) because Ole Miss is going to be petty. They have Patterson&rsquo;s reportedly ironclad case to be freed of sitting out a transfer year, but they don&rsquo;t have to respond until 10 days after the ??? days it takes the NCAA to send a hard copy to Oxford of the same thing Michigan sent.</p>
<p>Harbaugh said the coaches are still treating it like a three-way race between Patterson, Peters, and McCaffrey, with snaps split equally. <strong>Joe Milton</strong> is on campus and impressing in his preparation but a redshirt is most likely.</p>
<p align="center">--------------------</p>
<h3>
	Running Back</h3>
<p><em>Gone: Ty Isaac<br />
	Off redshirt: Kurt Taylor<br />
	<em>Arrive in fall<em>: Christian Turner, Michael Barrett, Hassan Haskins</em></em></em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more or less the same depth chart as it&rsquo;s been since Isaac&rsquo;s injury last year. That is your co-starters remain <strong>Karan Higdon</strong> and <strong>Chris Evans</strong>, with <strong>Kareem Walker</strong> and <strong>O&rsquo;Maury Samuels</strong> in competition for two hundred-odd carries behind them. Sam <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Previewing-Michigan-Footballs-running-back-position-in-Spring-practice-2018-116522427" target="_blank">spoke with RBs coach Jay Harbaugh</a> who mentioned Karan Higdon&rsquo;s growth at running the counter cutbacks that <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/neck-sharpies-back-side-power" target="_blank">we wrote about last year</a>. The incoming freshmen were mentioned with the walk-ons, so I&rsquo;m reading that as a four-man stable for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>[after THE JUMP: the rest]</strong></p>

<h3>
	Offensive Line</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>Gone: LT Mason Cole, OC Patrick Kugler, Ja&rsquo;Raymond Hall<br />
	Off redshirt: Chuck Filiaga, Andrew Steuber, Joel Honigford, Grant Newsome?<br />
	Arrive in fall: Jalen Mayfield, Ryan Hayes </em></p>
<p><a href="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am.png"><em><img alt="pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am" border="0" height="319" src="http://mgoblog.com/sites/mgoblog.com/files/pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am_thumb.png" title="pasted_image_at_2017_08_14_10_16_am" width="564" /></em></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>I thought of the nicest thing I could [via me]</em></p>
<p>Six offensive linemen return who started last year, however among them only <strong>Ben Bredeson</strong>, <strong>Mike Onwenu</strong>, and <strong>Cesar Ruiz</strong> appear likely to start on this year&rsquo;s line. Via Harbaugh, <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">Ruiz is has made the transition to center</a> and might be the best player this year on the line. Various offseason chatter had <strong>Andrew Vastardis </strong>and <strong>Stephen Spanellis </strong>also in competition for graduated Patrick Kugler&rsquo;s job but your three no-redshirt guys are mostly likely your starting interior.</p>
<p>Outside it&rsquo;s still a mess. Despite a world-class Rubik&rsquo;s Cube culture, Michigan did not get the Rice OT transfer Calvin Anderson, so it&rsquo;s back to last year&rsquo;s material plus a year and new coaches. <strong>James Hudson</strong>, who moved from DT last year,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>gets mentioned the most often by coaches&mdash;hopefully that means they&rsquo;ve found a solid four-year starter. Of the rest of the 2017 haul, <strong>Chuck Filiaga </strong>gets the most mention; <strong>Andrew Stueber</strong> and Joel Honigford were mentioned among the guards. Max Bultman of The Athletic had <a href="https://theathletic.com//286645/2018/03/24/four-key-storylines-as-michigan-football-opens-camp/?redirected=1" target="_blank">a &ldquo;four key storlines&rdquo; article</a>($) that of course mentioned the tackles but got the problem backwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harbaugh rattled off some names he felt good about &mdash; Juwann Bushell-Beatty, Jon Runyan, Chuck Filiaga and James Hudson &mdash; but this feels like a group where you want two guys to really emerge. After last season, the skeptics won&rsquo;t go quiet until the starters, at the very least, are moving the bodies across from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving bodies in the run game wasn&rsquo;t the problem; pass protection was.</p>
<p>The other three sometime starters, <strong>Nolan Ulizio</strong>, <strong>Juwann Bushell-Beatty</strong>, and <strong>Jon Runyan Jr</strong>. all saw time at right tackle last year, but none lead for either open job. Ulizio doesn&rsquo;t even get mentioned. I have a hunch that Runyan&rsquo;s still the fallback option if none of the rolls above hit, and JBB&rsquo;s a better option than we&rsquo;re giving him credit for.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Grant Newsome </strong>Lives<strong>&rdquo; </strong>articles peppered the offseason, and there&rsquo;s nobody I&rsquo;d like to see back on the field more, <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">but as of Friday</a>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Is Grant Newsome able to practice yet?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>He can do anything with the team right now?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working out, he&rsquo;s conditioning, but he&rsquo;s not at the point to come back and practice with the team.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;hope is still just that. I did a double-take last week when Newsome announced on Twitter he had been accepted to grad school at &ldquo;Ford&rdquo; before realizing he meant the Michigan School for Public Policy. Odds of Newsome solving this year&rsquo;s left tackle situation remain about the same as Newsome becoming President of the United States one day, i.e. ~25%.</p>
<p>Gun to head, the OL from left to right is Hudson-Bredeson-Ruiz-Onewnu-[Ask again in fall] and President Newsome wins his 2044 reelection in a landside.</p>

Haven&rsquo;t heard much on the &ldquo;move&rdquo; tight end position except for <strong>Nick Eubanks</strong> getting as much mention as McKeon and Gentry. Presume progress. <strong>Ben Mason </strong>named one of the most vocal guys on the team with Devin Bush, Chase Winovich and Rashan Gary. <strong>Jared Wangler</strong> has moved to fullback.</p>

Add the return of <strong>Tarik Black</strong>, who could have played in the bowl game if they didn&rsquo;t want to waste a medshirt, and that 2017 class should feature prominently this year.</p>

<p align="center"><em>rejected cover for this year&rsquo;s book by MonuMental</em></p>
<p>The starters are no surprise: Chase and Gary on the weak and strong sides, and in the middle is a continuation of the rotation of <strong>Aubrey Solomon/Bryan Mone</strong> at nose and <strong>Michael Dwumfour</strong> taking over Hurst&rsquo;s job. Sam notes Mone has come far, dropping weight and healing well.</p>
<p>Three different coaches <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Hes-Ready-to-Take-the-Next-Step-116302299?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">told Sam Webb</a>($) that <strong>Michael Dwumfour</strong> is going to be, well not Mo Hurst but a worthy successor to Mo Hurst&rsquo;s job, with Mattison going so far to say &ldquo;He has got that first and second step that Mo had.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s up to 295 and no longer slowed by injury.</p>
<p>The award for most hyped backup (not including NT rotation) goes to <strong>Kwity Paye</strong>, who is up to 256 pounds from the 235 sopping wet he played at last year. The other two guys in the rotation are <strong>Lawrence Marshall</strong>, Carlo Kemp (see below), and <strong>Deron Irving-Bey</strong>, who&rsquo;s up to 300 and backing up at interior. <strong>Taylor Upshaw</strong> is on campus and impressed with his speed.</p>
<p><strong>Carlo Kemp</strong> is another guy who&rsquo;s coming up unbidden in coach conversations. Kemp is up near 280, and one-arm lifting dumbells that weigh as much as the starting corners. The coaches are <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Three-Winter-Conditioning-Transformations-116266117?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">considering using him inside</a>. That probably says more about the depth after the three DT starters, though that&rsquo;s not much of a concern considering there&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p><strong>Jeter</strong> and <strong>Vilain</strong> are still recovering from last year&rsquo;s injuries. Paea is practicing at DT. Nothing about RoJo.</p>
<p>Rashan Gary might be <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/mgoboard/rashan-wear-98" target="_blank">wearing #98</a> this spring. On good authority Michigan dumped the Legends Jersey program because Harbaugh made it one of his points for taking the job. The old rules are presumably back in play, which were you had to be a family member or direct descendent to wear a retired number (in Crisler there&rsquo;s a display of several athletes doing so). If the Harmons are okay I don&rsquo;t see an issue, but wild guess: it&rsquo;s just a spring fling.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Hello backfield my old friend. [Fuller]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just block-quoting AZBlue&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/diaries/prespring-football-updates-sam-webb" target="_blank">now-a-diary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LBs - Don Brown sounded almost giddy when talking about this.&nbsp; I believe the quote was &quot;I am going to just sit back grinning like a Cheshire cat watching the competition.&nbsp; Has never had a group like this.&nbsp; Depth chart sounds like MLB - Bush, Anthony, Singleton WLB - Gil/Ross battle and Singleton.&nbsp; Viper - Hudson and Glasgow with Furbush and Uche in the more traditional SAM role.&nbsp; Singleton (as seen above) will get time at MLB and WLB to find him a place on the field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Devin Bush Jr.</strong> hype translated into all-B1Gish play last year so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the coaches are raving about him still. Sam stayed on Don Brown about Singleton and got back a &ldquo;Yes! He and Josh Ross&hellip;&rdquo; answer, and <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Board/102410/Contents/Webblog-Three-Winter-Conditioning-Transformations-116266117?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">something about nutrition</a>($), FWIW. It is nice to hear the good Dr. Blitz isn&rsquo;t sweating the rest of the depth chart, since we barely saw any of them last year except for some Devin Gil (and Sam but I&rsquo;m talking about the Mike and Will spots). <strong>Josh Ross </strong>has a slim lead on Gil as next WLB starter, and <strong>Jordan Anthony </strong>is coming on as Bush&rsquo;s understudy, and the coaches will rotate in <strong>Drew Singleton </strong>at both spots because they want him on the field. Michigan might have had a shot at getting Mike McCray a 6th year; I choose to take the fact that they didn&rsquo;t look into it as evidence they&rsquo;re not worried about what they&rsquo;ve seen in practice.</p>
<p>Your traditional SAMs remain <strong>Noah Furbush</strong> and <strong>Josh Uche</strong>, though they still have slightly different roles.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Mason </strong>is at fullback but may come back and play some MLB as well.</p>

It also gave a fairly specific rundown of the state of the safety depth chart. <strong>Tyree Kinnel </strong>remains locked in at the free safety position, and is by far the most advanced at getting the defense set and adjusted to motions, etc.</p>
<p>But the coaches are really high on Tyree&rsquo;s top backup, <strong>Jaylen Kelly-Powell</strong>, who&rsquo;s getting to play safety full time after bouncing between that and cornerback and nickel last year. He&rsquo;s no longer a stick.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Metellus </strong>however appears to be in a wide open competition for his Rover job, with <strong>Ja&rsquo;Marick Woods </strong>the main challenger, and <strong>Brad Hawkins</strong>, traded back from Viper, charging up from behind <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Michigan-defensive-coordinator-Don-Brown-and-safeties-coach-Chris-Partridge-break-down-Michigan-Football-safeties-in-2018-116554650/Amp?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">with tantalizing upside</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have <b><a href="https://247sports.com/Player/Brad-Hawkins-46483">Brad Hawkins</a></b>. That&rsquo;s my guy,&quot; [Partridge] said of the former Camden (NJ) star. &quot;I think that&rsquo;s a great move (to move him back). He&rsquo;s a natural cover guy. We have to get him moving along on learning both spots. He had a really eye-opening year practicing at VIPER and it&rsquo;s going to make him a much better safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Viper spot remains Khaleke Hudson&rsquo;s; <strong>Jordan Glasgow</strong> was the man traded for Hawkins. The traditional SAM job is covered in the linebackers.</p>

<p>A lot of new faces in the program, in and out of the official coaching ranks.</p>
<p>Offense saw the most movement. Erstwhile OTs/TEs coach Greg Frey joined FSU (his alma mater) and they very gingerly removed Drevno. This year the NCAA begins allowing a 9th paid assistant, which they also spent on O.</p>
<p>Those additions: tight ends coach <strong>Sherrone Moore</strong>, OL guru <strong>Ed Warinner</strong>, and WRs coach <strong>Jim McElwain</strong>. <strong>Moore</strong> was at CMU and is a hot up-and-comer who should give Michigan a few good years of value as a coach and recruiter en route to an OC/HC career. <strong>Warinner</strong>, whose son is a walk-on at State, built the good early Urban OLs until he was Peters Principled to OC. <strong>McElwain</strong>&hellip;is a former SEC coach who might be an upgrade over a disinterested Pep and grad assistants in training the young receivers corps. His Florida career suggests he&rsquo;s not much of a recruiter and should be kept away from offensive strategy (and sharks) at all costs. They&rsquo;ve also brought back <strong>Roy Roundtree</strong> as a ballyhooed grad assistant.</p>
<p>Nobody has been named offensive coordinator. Harbaugh claims it&rsquo;s a collaborative effort, and noted Bo never had an OC*. In reality the OC is Harbaugh and will be Harbaugh.</p>
<p>Defensively they&rsquo;ve brought in <strong>Al Washington</strong>, another Don Brown acolyte, to replace Don Brown acolyte Brian Smith. Washington has coached all over the place, mostly special teams and DL, and is listed as a &ldquo;defensive assistant coach.&rdquo; My guess is he&rsquo;ll be working with the young outside linemen and outside (Sam) linebackers. <strong>Chris Partridge</strong> moved back to help in the secondary&mdash;fortunately with Michael Zordich still around and Devin Bush Sr. back as a secondary analyst.</p>
<p>New strength coach <strong>Ben Herbert</strong>, who did his best work building Wisconsin&rsquo;s meat grinders, is <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Bolt/Former-Arkansas-offensive-lineman-Frank-Ragnow-breaks-down-Michigan-strength-and-conditioning-coach-Ben-Herbert-113402231" target="_blank">working more on core strength</a>; his predecessor apparently leaned more toward conditioning.</p>
<p><em>* [De jure this is true, at least until Moeller was named offensive coordinator shortly before Bo&rsquo;s retirement. Via Dr. Sap&rsquo;s interview with Jerry Hanlon in 2015 HTTV however it&rsquo;s clear that the little line coach was offensive coordinator in all but title&mdash;and he definitely wanted that title!]</em></p>

<h3>
	Simplified Offense and RPOs!</h3>
<p align="center"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmScholarlyGuanaco?autoplay=0" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p align="center"><em>I think this was an RPO: if the SAM stays in the box O&rsquo;Korn throws the Evans bubble, otherwise it&rsquo;s a Higdon backside fold that makes the frontside DE think he&rsquo;s getting optioned.</em></p>
<p>A big theme of this offseason has been Harbaugh&rsquo;s mea culpa for last year&rsquo;s offensive problems. Coach told Sam Webb on the radio that he probably <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-didnt-mince-words-about-some-of-the-problems-that-ailed-Michigans-offense-last-season-116237864" target="_blank">put too much on their plates</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>And then identifying what we do offensively. Some of that is getting really good at the things we&#39;re good at and what our personnel fits. There will be less volume to (the offense). I felt like there were times where we would put things in and then run them in the game, but the players hadn&#39;t practiced it enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just went through the film of the Ohio State game this weekend and 1) Yes, and 2) Michigan kept the Buckeyes off balance all game by seesawing between completely different looks. At the end of the 1st quarter they ran an inside zone off an Ace-11 look. Next down after the quarter break they came out in an unbalanced goal line formation and sprung McKeon for a worst-waldo TD.</p>
<p>The shifting identity throughout the season was a more serious issue. That was somewhat unavoidable due to quarterback injuries, and also self-inflicted. After an offseason of Pep-style let-Speight-read-five-guys-in-a-pattern and Frey-style zone running, they chose Ulizio for RT at the last minute even though he couldn&rsquo;t pass block. Unable to protect Speight, they nerfed his reads dramatically vs Purdue, and then he went down. Then it was super-simplified for O&rsquo;Korn through PSU. After that they scrapped the zone, inserted JBB at RT, and ran manball with Brandon Peters under center until Wisconsin knocked him out. By Ohio State (with Runyan now at RT) this had devolved to a grab-bag of gimmicks; the bowl game was a clown show.</p>
<p>Harbaugh <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-didnt-mince-words-about-some-of-the-problems-that-ailed-Michigans-offense-last-season-116237864" target="_blank">sat down with Sam last week</a> and said the moment he knew the passing game was in trouble was Speight&rsquo;s first interception against Florida:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&#39;ll give you a real specific when it comes to training up the quarterbacks. I felt like where I made just a huge mistake was training in the offseason,&rdquo; Harbaugh admitted. &ldquo;In the spring practices and the training camp we go against our defense. It&#39;s offense against defense&hellip; one&#39;s against one&#39;s. We really did that exclusively in spring ball and a good 10 days or so into training camp. Our defense is different. They play a lot of cover one&hellip; a lot of press man&hellip; But I didn&#39;t feel like we showed them enough looks from the quarters, (or) enough looks from quarter-quarter-half, (or) enough looks of zone blitz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hit me way too late&hellip; during the first half of the Florida game. Wilton was throwing a dig over the middle about 16 to 18 yards, and he threw it high and it got intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Right there I am standing on the sidelines going, &lsquo;this is what he&#39;s done for the last six months&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s interview with Harbaugh and another with Pep Hamilton &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; that run-pass options <a href="https://247sports.com/college/michigan/Article/Jim-Harbaugh-says-run-pass-option-plays-will-be-a-part-of-the-attack-plan-moving-forward-116495951?Notification.Success=You+have+successfully+logged+in!" target="_blank">will definitely be part of the offense</a>. I&rsquo;m doing an HTTV article on this right now and I&rsquo;ll spoil the ending to save you some hyperventilation: Michigan already runs them, has been running them, and probably isn&rsquo;t going to run them that much more than they did against Ohio State (three to five times a game). Harbaugh on <a href="http://www.mgoblog.com/content/spring-practice-presser-3-23-17-jim-harbaugh" target="_blank">at the Friday presser</a> needed a reminder:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You talked to The Michigan Insider [and said] that you were going to implement more RPO, you were looking into it and you were going to implement more RPO. Maybe not overhaul completely, but&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who at The Michigan Insider?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Sam Webb.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. [chuckles] We&rsquo;re studying our offense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al Borges ran RPOs at Michigan too. They work within your offense, but over half the time an announcer is exclaiming &ldquo;RPO!&rdquo; it&rsquo;s probably just a run-of-the-mill play-action pass.</p>
