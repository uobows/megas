I tried to add the SDK manually, but couldn&#039;t do that.  After reinstalling one SDK, then it worked fine.

But then another problem came, I couldn&#039;t debug any applications in the emulator.  I have followed the instructions in the documentation very carefully, but still no luck.  After trying for a couple of hours, then I was just too tired and gave up.

Hope the next release will be more useful.

It seems all your work was about installing it :)
Did you actually use it, check the emulator and do some development?
How did that go?
I downloaded it but not yet installed it. I am looking forward to check their UI configuration style switching thing and see how to port apps from 2.1. They are providing guides, which is a good start; let&#039;s see how it goes.
