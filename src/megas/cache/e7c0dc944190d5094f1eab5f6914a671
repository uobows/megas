Golf cart kits can make a wealth of difference and here?s a look at the most popular kits to choose from.&nbsp;</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><h4><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lift Kits</span></h4></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The most common golf cart kit that is purchased is a lift kit, which raises your cart higher off the ground. While some people add a lift kit because of the way it looks, there is a functionality to it. Lift kits allow you to install bigger tires, which can help when driving through rough terrain. Lift kits are also ideal for owners looking to haul weighty loads. This is also a must have for off-road golf cart owners.</span><br /></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">LED Light Kits</span></h4></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jTr8PGwD2wk/Wl4var1aDoI/AAAAAAAAEjk/MDrPdKhNjKcDg5Uxqf7nvouVrGrK1wjpwCLcBGAs/s1600/DSC03898.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Club Car XRT950, consumer utility vehicle, XRT 950 golf carts, new golf car" border="0" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jTr8PGwD2wk/Wl4var1aDoI/AAAAAAAAEjk/MDrPdKhNjKcDg5Uxqf7nvouVrGrK1wjpwCLcBGAs/s400/DSC03898.jpg" title="Club Car XRT950, consumer utility vehicle, XRT 950 golf carts, golf car" width="400" /></a><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">LED light kits are available for headlights, taillights and brake lights. LED bulbs last a longer and are much more reliable than a standard bulb. These LED bulbs will last for years, meaning that you will probably be free from ever having to replace a bulb on your cart. LED bulbs are also impervious to temperature changes while sturdy enough to withstand the wear and tear of normal golf cart use.&nbsp;<a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars in Charlotte NC</a> offers a vast array of LED light kits to choose from.</span><br /><br /></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Graphic Kits</span></h4></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There is a long line of choices when it comes to adding custom graphic kits to your golf cart. That doesn?t mean you need a whole new paint job. Graphic kits provide a way of adding color and designs to your golf cart. It can also aid in functionality. For example, hunters who use a golf cart can opt for a camouflage graphics kit. There really is a vast array of graphics to choose from and it costs much less than a custom paint job.&nbsp;</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><h4><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Rear Seat Kits</span></h4></div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 20.72px; white-space: pre-wrap;">These kits can turn your two-passenger golf cart into one that comfortably seats four passengers. The kits actually provide extra seats that fit onto the back of your cart. These are popular add-on items made by all the leading manufacturers, including Club Car and Yamaha golf carts.

There are pros and cons to each one along with some important questions that every buyer should ask before making a purchase. <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">CarolinaGolfCars.com</a> is here with answers for you!<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How Far Will You Be Driving?</h4>Distance matters when selecting a golf cart. The farther you drive on a regular basis, the more likely you are to choose a gas operated golf cart. The only thing you will need when driving long distances is more gas. You can even fill up at a nearby gas station. Electric golf carts will not travel as far without needing to stop and charge the battery. Owners who drive shorter distances are more prone to choosing an electric cart.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9QWvFI9qseA/WjvlCX9C5sI/AAAAAAAAEcw/VxLxP2HLZBImIJio-JC5DwLbD1MfGeOJwCEwYBhgL/s1600/countryside-2326787_1920.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="903" data-original-width="1600" height="225" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9QWvFI9qseA/WjvlCX9C5sI/AAAAAAAAEcw/VxLxP2HLZBImIJio-JC5DwLbD1MfGeOJwCEwYBhgL/s400/countryside-2326787_1920.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How Much Horsepower Do You Want?</h4>The more horsepower in a cart, the faster it will go. Gas carts generally come with more horsepower and often qualify for upgrades so that your cart can move even faster. <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/custom-golf-carts/" target="_blank">Electric golf carts</a> are typically a bit slower. Having more horsepower can also help getting over steep hills so consider where you will be driving your cart when deciding how much power you will need.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How Important is Sound?</h4>For obvious reasons, gas carts make a little more hum when they are running and are a bit nosier. Electric cars are quieter and a more popular option for people looking to drive them within their communities.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How Handy Are You?</h4>Golf cart maintenance does not take much training, although gas powered carts are similar to cars. The engine has a lot of working parts that need to be maintained. Electric carts have much less maintenance required. The only real major checkups that need to be done on electric carts is checking the batteries and monitoring its water levels.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How Eco-Friendly Do You Need to Be?</h4>Electric carts emit no exhaust fumes into the atmosphere while gas carts do. Newer gas models produce less exhaust, although some communities have rules about gas carts being used in specific areas. Those restrictions could also extend to parks and golf courses. Make sure you know the rules before you buy.<br /><br />Golf cart sales are made easy at Carolina Golf Cars as there is an option for customers on all kinds of budgets.

That is why it is important to be in the know when buying used golf carts. Older model or <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/refurbished-carts/" target="_blank">used golf carts for sale</a> can still provide a lot of life, although there are certain things buyers should look for.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Refurbishing</h4>Refurbished is a word buyers should really get to know. Many older model golf carts are refurbished and still run like new. However, other carts may not be modified as well. That is why it is critical to examine the level of refurbishment. First, ask for the extent of all repairs. Then, take the time to examine the cart. Grip the roof and give the cart a good shake. While doing this, listen for any strange noises. Also, examine the tread on the tires and try to find rust spots on the body. And be sure to check every feature on the cart while taking it for a test drive.<br /><h4 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;">Brand names</h4>Just as it is with making any other major purchase, certain brand names have more credibility. Some lesser known golf cart brands might seem to operate just as well as a more recognizable name brand, such as <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/new-golf-carts/yamaha/" target="_blank">Yamaha Golf Carts</a>. But think ahead to the future. If there is a need for replacement parts, Yamaha parts will be more readily available, making any repairs cheaper and easier. <br /><h4 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;">Batteries</h4>One of the most common and costly repairs to golf carts comes with having to replace the battery pack. Various models can require anywhere from four to ten batteries to power the cart. Check the level of fluid within each battery. A number of dry cells in the battery means that it is on the decline. Dark battery acid is another indicator that there is not many miles left on that particular battery. Also check the battery connections and stay clear of ones that are corroded or green in color. <br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Wear and tear</h4>A good used golf cart will not show a lot of wear and tear. However, if the previous owner beat up that cart, it will show. The seat upholstery is a good sign of how well a cart was taken care of. And carts that have been kept outside will generally have rooftops that are faded. The thickness of the rubber on the gas and brake pedal is another sign of just how much a cart has been driven. Also, be sure to check the brakes and the parking brake. Carts that pull to one side when braking mean that it?s almost time for some break repair. A simply visit <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">CarolinaGolfCars.com</a> will allow you to order the quality parts you need or schedule an appointment at their service center.<br /><br /><br />Carolina Golf Car provides professionally refurbished and used golf carts for sale that still have lots of life left in them. Buying a used golf cart at Carolina Golf Cars comes with quality service, competitive prices, honesty and integrity.<br /></div>";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6350081566167736342/posts/default/9167409398127831557";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6350081566167736342/posts/default/9167409398127831557";s:4:"link";s:80:"http://carolinagolfcars.blogspot.com/2017/11/tips-for-buying-used-golf-cart.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Ricky Haidar";s:10:"author_uri";s:45:"https://plus.google.com/100378077812297189188";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:3;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6350081566167736342.post-269547581083023462";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-10-11T10:49:00.001-04:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-10-11T10:49:43.726-04:00";s:5:"title";s:36:"How to Properly Clean Your Golf Cart";s:12:"atom_content";s:3908:"<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X-NjyqclK-0/Vp1aAAN1z0I/AAAAAAAABLk/rQm8UO6e7UY/s1600/xrt1550sediesel.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="143" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X-NjyqclK-0/Vp1aAAN1z0I/AAAAAAAABLk/rQm8UO6e7UY/s200/xrt1550sediesel.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Maintaining your golf cart comes with the task keeping it clean so that it remains in top-notch working condition. Routine golf cart cleaning will also wash away any signs of rusting or rotting so that your golf cart will last for a long time. Here are some tips to follow when it comes time to clean your <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/refurbished-carts/" target="_blank">golf cart</a>.<br /><br /><h4>Remember the Battery</h4>It might not strike you as the first thing to clean on your golf cart, but it may be the most important. Battery connections can experience a buildup of dirt, grime and corrosion. Regular cleanings are fairly easy and can be done with baking soda and something with bristles, such as a toothbrush. Also, make sure no metal is contacting your terminals before cleaning as you want to always maintain safety first.<br /><h4><br />Go Soft On the Seats</h4>Many golf carts are equipped with vinyl seats, which are not very difficult to clean. A combination of water and a mild soap should do the trick, but make sure not to use too much water and soak the seats. Doing so could cause water to settle inside the cushion and that could lead to a buildup of mildew, which will eventually destroy the seats. Golf carts that are equipped with seat covers can have those covers washed separately and some can also be machine washed. Follow the cleaning instructions accordingly.<br /><h4><br />Mind the Wiring</h4>When cleaning the outside of your cart, it is important to keep water from getting into the electrical system. So just don?t spray the hose on full blast for extended spurts. Get familiar with your cart and look for any place where electrical components are exposed. Be cautious of any wiring and wash around those places very carefully. Soaking your wiring could lead to high and otherwise unnecessary repair bills.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Fx1ooqurLc/Wd4vGv3AgyI/AAAAAAAAEO0/6PWJyyQaL_k_QJPBW4rWt_HiizuP7I6ewCLcBGAs/s1600/raindrops-1516632_1920.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1063" data-original-width="1600" height="212" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Fx1ooqurLc/Wd4vGv3AgyI/AAAAAAAAEO0/6PWJyyQaL_k_QJPBW4rWt_HiizuP7I6ewCLcBGAs/s320/raindrops-1516632_1920.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Remember the Clear Coat</h4>Golf carts are very similar to automobiles when it comes to cleaning as each are made with a protective clear coat on the exterior. What that essentially means is that owners should not use any abrasive cleaning products. Waxing is also recommended and it is important to use a brand of clear coat wax that will not damage the exterior surface. <br /><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank"><br /></a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars</a> is your one-stop shop for new, used and custom golf carts for sale, golf cart repairs and much more.

But sometimes, there are ways of upgrading your golf cart and bringing better functionality to it. This can be done with a number of add-on features and here is a look at some of the ways to improve upon your golf cart.<br /><br /><h4>Off-Road Accessories</h4>A cargo box is a great addition to any <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/4x4s-consumer-utility-vehicles/" target="_blank">off-road golf cart</a> as it provides the capability for more storage and hauling. A brush guard for the front of your golf cart is a nice addition when it comes to traveling through rough terrain. It is also a good idea to lift your golf cart to accommodate with any unexpected clearance issues.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jBgXhrqpWYU/Vo1R91hR9HI/AAAAAAAABGc/-hvMe6fbs70/s1600/custom%2BGEM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="custom golf cart, customized golf car" border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jBgXhrqpWYU/Vo1R91hR9HI/AAAAAAAABGc/-hvMe6fbs70/s320/custom%2BGEM.jpg" title="custom golf cart, customized golf car" width="320" /></a></div><h4>Street Legal Golf Cart Accessories</h4>There are a number of features to add onto <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">street legal golf carts</a>, including a dash cover. There are also ways to make your golf cart more practical and that comes with adding a cell phone holder or beverage holder inside. There is even the option of installing a charger port so that your devices maintain plenty of life. Bluetooth options are also available.<br /><br /><h4>Safety Accessories</h4>Safety should always be a priority no matter where you drive your golf cart. Adding seat belts along with headlights and taillights will make for safer travels. A safety grab bar is also a way of ensuring safe passage for riders in the backseat. Safety decals and warning labels can also be applied to various parts of your golf cart.<br /><br /><h4>Heating Accessories</h4>Not every day is going to be a warm one. To compensate for a lack of natural warmth, electric heaters are available for mounting on the front of your golf cart. These work even better in golf carts that are equipped with an enclosure.

Prospective buyers can really have anything they want. These accessories include lift kits, stereos, upgraded motors, fender flares and more. Custom paint is also available as there is no such thing as a conventional golf cart anymore. When wading through the selection process, deciding on customizations is an integral step for buyers. What features, upgrades and accessories you want is an important question to ask.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Permissions</h3></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bkGzbOzHdWg/VmnNSpi8MtI/AAAAAAAAA_M/_uGK55JKmSk/s1600/FreedomRXV_IS_2013.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="133" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bkGzbOzHdWg/VmnNSpi8MtI/AAAAAAAAA_M/_uGK55JKmSk/s200/FreedomRXV_IS_2013.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Not all golf carts are driven on golf courses nowadays. Some are used in communities while others are used on actual roads. It?s a good idea to check the township laws regarding golf carts. Those buyers not looking to play golf will need to purchase a street legal golf cart. These can also be defined as low speed vehicles, <i>which means the max speed is around 25 mph</i>. Certain municipalities define <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">street legal golf carts</a> as ones that are built that way and not standard models which have received upgrades. Check out all the rules and regulations while also making sure that the street legal golf cart has the necessary functions, such as headlights, turn signals etc. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Necessities</h3></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Being as though golf carts pose a threat to drivers, passengers and pedestrians, it is wise to purchase insurance. In the event of an accident, drivers could be held liable and that could lead to costly expenses. Some homeowner?s policies cover golf cart usage while there are also providers who offer the option of adding golf carts to an auto insurance policy. Furthermore, there are safety practices golf cart users should become acquainted with when driving. That pertains to using hand signals on turns, yielding to pedestrians, and reducing speed on hills and declines.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Carolina's premier <b>golf cart super center</b>, Carolina Golf Cars, has the selection and experience to help customers buy the right cart for them.

Here is a look at some not so commonly known tidbits about the golf cart.<br /><br />Golf carts actually paved the way for the creation of other kinds of personal transportation vehicles, such as NEVs (Neighborhood Electric Vehicles). The low cost and easy maintenance were two major selling points, not to mention affordability.<br /><br />Golf carts save a lot of time and effort. Golfers who use a golf cart instead of walking through 18 holes of golf save themselves a walk of approximately four miles.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7EtcmGl74uM/WWfQd9IGhcI/AAAAAAAADok/zQEpsbS5j18nREG-r4W0arNXHia6nbzhwCLcBGAs/s1600/golfers-1956592_1920.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1063" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7EtcmGl74uM/WWfQd9IGhcI/AAAAAAAADok/zQEpsbS5j18nREG-r4W0arNXHia6nbzhwCLcBGAs/s320/golfers-1956592_1920.jpg" width="212" /></a></div>The gas vs. electric debate has continued for quite some time. However, most experts believe electric golf carts are better for golfers or short cruises through a community. <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/4x4s-consumer-utility-vehicles/" target="_blank">Gas-powered golf carts</a> are considered to be the best option for longer trips. <br /><br />Golf cart drivers can receive a DUI if operating their cart under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Golf cart laws differ from state to state, but causing damage while driving under the influence usually subjects operators to the same penalties they would suffer if they were driving a car. <br /><br />The most common serious types of golf cart injuries are concussions followed by neck injuries. These injuries are brought about most often by hanging outside the vehicle or by putting the cart in reverse while going downhill. <br /><br />Golf cart insurance covers a wide array of areas, including collision, damage liability, uninsured motorist bodily injury, and there is even the option of roadside assistance. It is becoming more popular for every golf cart owner to purchase an individual insurance policy for their cart. <br /><br />Almost half of all golf cart accidents are caused by someone falling out of the cart. Turning a corner at just 10 mph is enough to throw someone from the golf cart. Every year, there are approximately 10,000 emergency room visits caused by golf cart injuries. It is important to remember that most of these accidents are avoidable if basic safety guidelines are followed at all times.<br /><br />Carolina Golf Cars is the nation?s one-stop shop that provides every golf cart owner with everything they need.

Regardless of how much is invested in a golf cart, it is important to keep it in proper working order. Here are some helpful hints when it comes to maintaining your golf cart.<br /><br /><h4>Battery Maintenance</h4>Maintaining your battery is an important part of keeping your golf cart running efficiently. However, be careful not to overcharge your battery since that could cause damage. Using an automatic charger is the best way to charge your golf cart battery because it automatically shuts down once the battery has received a full charge.<br /><br />Monthly checking of the batteries? water levels is extremely important to ensure that the batteries do not die prematurely. Always check and add to the water level when they are fully charged.&nbsp; Distilled water is recommended by all major battery manufacturers.<br /><br /><h4>Wash Right</h4>Just like cars, golf carts are going to get dirty with normal usage. It is important to use an automotive wash instead of something like dishwasher detergent or an ordinary household soap. There?s a need to use some type of cleaner that is designed for an automotive wash. Waxing is recommended occasionally, but it?s a good idea to stay away from waxes containing abrasive compounds. <br /><br /><h4>Other Monthly Checks</h4>You do not have to be a mechanic to perform some important monthly checks on your golf cart. Check your battery for any sign of corrosion, which can be eliminated with baking soda. Air pressure in the tires should also be checked. There should be a reading of 18-20 psi in four-ply tires and 30-34 psi in six-ply tires.<br /><br /><h4>Clean the Windshield</h4>Windshields are generally made of acrylic or polycarbonate, although Windex should never be used on either kind. Stay away from using paper towels as well. A soft cloth is best to clean a <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/parts-accessories/" target="_blank">golf carts windshields</a> and it is recommended to blot a windshield dry instead of wiping it dry. There are also cleaners that can remove smaller scratches in the windshield. <br /><br /><h4>Brake Cleanings</h4>Brakes are integral to any vehicle, especially golf carts. Brakes should be cleaned twice a year. That means cleaning the cables, drums and pads. A low brake pedal or squealing noises are also two signs that it is time for brake replacement.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nOk_4_bmoMQ/VkULkGSmQkI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/50kFFPkSlKo/s1600/8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Golf Cart for sale North Carolina South Carolina" border="0" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nOk_4_bmoMQ/VkULkGSmQkI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/50kFFPkSlKo/s320/8.jpg" title="Golf Cart for sale North Carolina, South Carolina" width="320" /></a></div><br />When it comes time to find the right parts for your <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">golf cart, Carolina Golf Cars</a> has everything you need.

While certain rules differ from one municipality to the next, here?s a look at some basic guidelines <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/" target="_blank">golf cart</a> drivers can follow.<br /><br />While a license is not needed to operate golf carts, states have minimum age requirements. Most states require a driver to be at least 14 years of age and a handful of others have set that minimum age at 13.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4Jrfuqin9pM/Vh0Pbh6LoGI/AAAAAAAAAqY/73S-BglK15k/s1600/rental_light.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="122" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4Jrfuqin9pM/Vh0Pbh6LoGI/AAAAAAAAAqY/73S-BglK15k/s200/rental_light.jpg" width="200" /></a><br />Operators should also watch how much alcohol they drink before driving. In most states, operators can be arrested for a DUI. There have been numerous incidents all over the country in which drivers have been arrested for a DUI and suffered the same consequences as regular motorists. Simply because a golf cart functions at lower speeds does not mean drivers are exempt from obeying motor vehicle laws. <br /><br />Basic rules should also be followed, such as no standing while the cart is in motion and keeping all riders? arms and legs inside the cart while it is in motion. Failing to obey traffic signs can also lead to the issuing of a ticket. Golf cart operators in many states receive tickets for not stopping at a stop sign and some can even be penalized for not having the proper registration.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JE4GnDsrupM/WSg27Wi-vCI/AAAAAAAADYs/2b-T7PA8SEsLYqZgA6_OTslHXxuX4P3hACLcB/s1600/Terrain1000_1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="343" data-original-width="447" height="245" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JE4GnDsrupM/WSg27Wi-vCI/AAAAAAAADYs/2b-T7PA8SEsLYqZgA6_OTslHXxuX4P3hACLcB/s320/Terrain1000_1.png" width="320" /></a></div>It is also important to note that most communities do not permit golf cart travel on its sidewalks. And when it comes to intersection crossings, golf cart drivers are expected to yield to motor vehicles as they have the right of way. <br /><br />The bottom line is that golf cart owners have a responsibility to familiarize themselves with the rules of the road in their particular municipality. A failure to do so could lead to more than a warning, but costly fees and penalties as operators are not immune to moving violations.<br /><br /><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars</a> has something for everyone including a huge selection of <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">street legal golf carts</a>.

Will it be used strictly on a golf course or out in the community, maybe for off road adventures? Golf cars can be used for driving around neighborhoods, hunting, and even hauling equipment. Before you are ready to buy, decide exactly how you are going to use your golf cart. That will help you decide whether you need a street legal golf cart, utility car or a certain variety of custom golf carts.<br /><span id="goog_1948395154"></span><span id="goog_1948395155"></span><br /><h4>Test Drive</h4>Don?t just test drive for cruising purposes, feel how the cart handles. If it is a bit bumpy, then you may want to consider a cart that features an independent front suspension. Much like automobiles, golf carts offer several driving features, which makes for a much smoother ride. Further comfortability can be achieved with the addition of custom parts and accessories.<br /><br /><h4>Explore the Options</h4>Some <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">golf carts for sale</a> come with limited options. Think of it as buying a car without power locks, power windows or a host of other perks. More esteemed companies offer a wide variety of accessories, options and add-on features. Brands like this make it easy to customize your cart with a large selection of upgrades.<br /><br /><h4>Know Your Terms</h4>Factor in the cost of running a gas-operated car as opposed to an electric cart and be sure to inquire about a warranty. Also, contact your insurance agent to see how much it will cost to insure your new cart. Quality dealerships, like <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars in Charlotte North Carolina</a>, offer a great range of financing options to make buying your dream golf cart that much easier.<br /><br />Carolina Golf Cars will walk you through the buying process, presenting you a wide selection of new and used golf carts for sale.

However, the entire sticker price does not have to be doled out all at once. Golf cart owners can pay as they go, without setting themselves back financially. <br /><br />Golf carts have quickly become a very popular item and depending on the model you purchase, it can add up to be a costly expense. Paying out of pocket for a golf cart is not always feasible for working-class families and retired senior citizens. Financing options are now available to help all different kinds of buyers get the golf cart they truly want. <br /><br />Options for <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/financing/" target="_blank">golf cart financing in Charlotte</a> have become as customary as obtaining a car loan. Many typical golf cart loans come with up to 100% financing while rates and monthly payments can be calculated prior to signing the deal. As is the case with car loans, an individual?s credit rating ties in with their specific APR.<br /><br />Another benefit that comes with the finance option is that owners can pay off their new golf carts earlier than their loan term stipulates. In the event that you come into any new money or experience a hefty payday, there is the option of wiping out any outstanding debt regarding your golf cart. <br /><br />When it comes to financing a golf cart, it does not mean you have to always buy a brand new model. Used golf carts for sale also qualify for financing depending upon the dealer. Many people may assume that the term financing implies that they must purchase a new cart. That is not at all the case as some used golf carts can demand high prices. Often times though the car manufacturers will offer finance incentives that are only available on new cars.<br /><span id="goog_1433191496"></span><span id="goog_1433191497"></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CfCpFJ5V4gk/WMBg4kvnsUI/AAAAAAAAC-c/gr714sao3RwWreLLiJIfXcA1WHZWJg6OQCLcB/s1600/8618105989_bf2be6a353_k.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="street legal golf carts, golf cars, club car, mobility" border="0" height="356" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CfCpFJ5V4gk/WMBg4kvnsUI/AAAAAAAAC-c/gr714sao3RwWreLLiJIfXcA1WHZWJg6OQCLcB/s640/8618105989_bf2be6a353_k.jpg" title="USF Health in The Villages, Ted Eytan, Taken on April 1, 2013 " width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Photo: "USF Health in The Villages" by Ted Eytan (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CC-licensed work</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/" target="_blank">Street legal golf carts</a> are also available for financing and can function just like an automobile in some communities.

Citizens are also able to operate golf carts in various state parks as each one adheres to its own set of rules and regulations regarding off road vehicles.<br /><br /><h4>Sporting Events</h4>Major and even smaller sporting events now employ the use of golf carts. Sports teams often use a golf cart as a way of transporting their mascots around. Inside a sporting event, golf carts help older or disabled people find their seats.

In fact, small urban vehicles are perceived by many to be the way of the future in Canada.<br /><br />Customizations, whether functional or purely appearance, have made golf carts something that can be very chic and cool. There are innumerable <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/parts-accessories/" target="_blank">ways to personalize golf carts</a> and that even applies to women. One look at social media sites like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/carolinagolfcar/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> will showcase hundreds of different golf carts for both women and men. <br /><br />The bottom line is that golf cart use and popularity are both on the rise as these vehicles look to be the wave of the future. <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Carolina Golf Cars specializes in all types of golf cart sales and golf cart repair.

Here?s a look at some of the accepted forms of golf cart etiquette that drivers can take onto the course.<br /><br /><b>Stay clear of the fairways</b><br />A general rule is not to just cruise down a fairway in your <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/rentals/" target="_blank">rental golf cart in Charlotte NC</a>. Another accepted rule is known as the 90-degree rule. Drivers are expected to drive alongside the fairway and then make a 90-degree turn when they come up to where their ball has landed, taking a perpendicular route. <br /><br /><b>Under construction</b><br />It is not uncommon to come across parts of a golf course that are being upgraded. When you see an area that is undergoing any type of repairs, drive around it. Your tires could damage some grass or turf that is in mid-construction. <br /><br /><b>Stay out of the sand</b><br />Sand bunkers can prove to be a problem area for more than just golfers. Not only is driving through the sand frowned upon, but it could also get you stuck. <br /><br /><b>Quiet please</b><br />Golf is a game of concentration, so remember to be mindful of other golfers while riding along a course. Try to avoid making any loud noises or pumping up the volume of your music. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5kGCoS7R7xE/WGL1mJRjQAI/AAAAAAAACpM/TEhDBnFr53wOKZRu1HPh8djDyQuV79-0gCLcB/s1600/golf-cart-1669772_1920.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5kGCoS7R7xE/WGL1mJRjQAI/AAAAAAAACpM/TEhDBnFr53wOKZRu1HPh8djDyQuV79-0gCLcB/s320/golf-cart-1669772_1920.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><b>Watch wet grounds</b><br />Wet ground is a prime candidate for damage due to the fact that the excess moisture causes it to lose some of its firmness. Tires could do a lot of damage to the ground when it is wet. Try to steer golf carts away from these wet patches. <br /><br /><b>Stay safe</b><br />More and more golf cart accidents occur each year, leaving drivers and passengers with all types of injuries. To avoid these issues, keep all limbs inside the cart when it is in motion, slow down on sharp turns, brake when going downhill, and try to always stay on the golf cart paths.<br /><br /><b>Stay behind</b><br />It is recommended that drivers always stay behind other golfers. Even when you are playing with another golfer who is walking, proper etiquette would be to never drive ahead and retrieve your ball first. It is also a danger to be way out in front of another golfer who is ready to swing.<br /><br />Carolina Golf Cars provides a long line of new and custom golf carts for sale.

That means getting familiar with all the important terms and parts associated with a golf cart. This plays a huge part when it comes to buying, <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/service-3/" target="_blank">maintaining and servicing your golf cart in Charlotte</a>.</span></h4>Certain terms are pretty self-explanatory, but something like <b>curb weight</b> carries a different meaning. Curb weight is a term used to define the overall weight of the cart that is equipped with all the standard equipment. That includes a full tank of gas along with all the other necessary fluids, but it does not include any type of cargo. <b>Dry weight</b> is the term that refers to the weight of a car without any fluids or fuel.<br /><br />Golf cart sales all require the buyer to choose an electronic or gas-powered cart. Electronic cars obviously have some different features and one of those is a <b>controller</b>. This is an important component because it makes it possible for power to travel from the battery to motor.<span id="goog_1349770771"></span> <br /><div style="text-align: right;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfr6GS1B-SE/WDe4cW78akI/AAAAAAAACjs/SEZD4DM2TQMxdSLKPqH0hGK7_IoxuQ06gCLcB/s1600/FB%2Bad%2Bimage%2B2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="148" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfr6GS1B-SE/WDe4cW78akI/AAAAAAAACjs/SEZD4DM2TQMxdSLKPqH0hGK7_IoxuQ06gCLcB/s400/FB%2Bad%2Bimage%2B2.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Some electronic carts are called <b>NEVs</b>, which stands for Neighborhood Electronic Vehicle. These qualify as <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">low speed vehicles</a> that are considered street legal golf carts.<b> LSVs</b> (legal street vehicles) are a little different in that they can be powered by fuels other than electricity. LSVs also require a top speed minimum of 20 mph.<br /><br />In both electric and gas-operated cars, the <b>wheelbase</b> is the name given to the space that lies between the center of the rear and front wheels. And in carts with a bed, the <b>cargo bed height</b> measures the amount of distance that lies between the platform of the bed and the ground.<br /><br />The <b>drive system</b> of a golf cart refers to the amount of wheels that receive engine torque all at the same time. <b>Bore and stroke</b> is another engine term that describes the distance traveled by the pitons in each engine cycle.<br /><br />No matter what purpose a golf cart serves, it is recommended to obtain <b>golf cart insurance</b>. There are different policies that exist to protect drivers as well as their golf cars. A quick consult with an insurance agent will shed more light on the finer parts of this area. <br /><br /><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars</a> is the leading distributor of new, refurbished and custom made golf carts.

Here?s a look at some interesting facts about the golf cart.</blockquote><br /><h4>Golf Cart Etiquette</h4><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eqwPPZeUz5A/VWSKVQmbIVI/AAAAAAAAAN8/nRpXJkMXW2Q/s1600/bigstock-Golf-Club-Cars-At-Golf-Field-52763674.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Golf carts, used golf carts at golf course" border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eqwPPZeUz5A/VWSKVQmbIVI/AAAAAAAAAN8/nRpXJkMXW2Q/s400/bigstock-Golf-Club-Cars-At-Golf-Field-52763674.jpg" title="Golf carts, used golf carts at golf course" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Golf carts lined up at the course. </td></tr></tbody></table>When playing on a course, there is an expected level of golf cart etiquette that goes beyond not driving like a maniac. Always remember to stay behind other golfers. Wet turf is also a problem area as it can cause carts to get stuck, or cause the turf to tear when being driven over. Try to avoid these wet spots. Some courses have a 90-degree rule which permits golfers to drive out onto the grass to retrieve their ball. However, golfers are expected to turn onto the grass at a 90-degree angle when they locate their ball and are not expected to just cruise up the fairway.<br /><br /><h4>The World?s Fastest Golf Cart</h4>Some people decided to push boundaries with their <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">custom golf carts</a>. The world?s fastest golf cart has now reached a whopping speed of 118 mph. The record time was recorded in November of 2014. While playing on the golf course, most carts are equipped with a governor which tops out speeds usually around 12 mph. But the golf cart has now notched a place in the Guinness Book of World Records with a blazing speed of 118.76 mph.<br /><br /><h4>History of the Golf Cart</h4>Golf carts were first introduced in the early 1930's as a means of helping disabled golfers get around the course. It was not until the 1950's that golf carts were mass produced and began gaining acceptance among golfers. However, people not fond of the idea labeled golf carts as the ?arthritis special' during that era. These earliest models had only one tire in the front and two in the back. Big changes would not arrive until the 1970's and 1980's when gasoline powered golf carts hit the market. This came with the addition in most cases of a fourth wheel as seen traditionally in today's models. Still being built with the choice of gasoline or electric powered motors, golf carts today are more versatile than ever. <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars</a> has established a long history of providing quality golf carts for sale. Custom-made golf cars are part of the long line of inventory along with new, refurbished and used golf carts.

People have come to rely heavily on these products as the economical, convenient and practical utility cars that they are. Truly, golf cars can have a world of uses:</div><br /><ul><li>Easy and safe mobilization of persons with disabilities and senior citizens in self-contained communities and retirement areas. </li><li>Transport of people, equipment, produce and other goods within airports, spacious buildings, campuses, seminaries, dealerships, warehouses, farms, villages and other private or commercial properties. </li><li>Security patrolling and maintenance of the aforementioned properties </li><li>Convenient transport within construction site</li><li>Gardening and other yard work and navigate the entire vicinity conveniently. </li><li>Event transportation, such as in weddings. </li><li>Snow plowing. </li><li>Hobbies and recreation, such as 4x4 driving and off-road activities.</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sCnSDOPiYgI/VT_T0hixqDI/AAAAAAAAAKc/xCNhdkMtDIE/s1600/xrt800gas.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sCnSDOPiYgI/VT_T0hixqDI/AAAAAAAAAKc/xCNhdkMtDIE/s1600/xrt800gas.jpg" /></a></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>What the Law Says About Golf Cars on the Road</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In 1998, when the number of electric-powered golf carts and small vehicles frequenting the streets like any other vehicle skyrocketed, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, operating under the Department of Transportation, promulgated the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 500 ((49 CFR 571.500).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Originally, the use of <span style="color: blue;"><u><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">street legal golf carts</a></u></span> and similar small vehicles were subject to local and state approval, as long as they did not exceed the speed limit of 20 miles per hour. Golf carts manufactured or modified to go faster than that are considered motor vehicles under the Federal law and should therefore comply with existing motor vehicle safety standards.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AseAzy36L38/VT_TZkMg1wI/AAAAAAAAAKU/LXhweIfqp1I/s1600/2five_4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="189" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AseAzy36L38/VT_TZkMg1wI/AAAAAAAAAKU/LXhweIfqp1I/s1600/2five_4.jpg" width="320" /></a>It was clear, however, that compliance with the motor vehicle safety standards under the Federal law was not feasible for golf carts and similar smaller vehicles. Consequently, the NHTSA reclassified golf carts with top speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour as ?low-speed vehicles.?  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: blue;"><u><a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">LSVs</a></u></span> are required under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 500 ?to be equipped with headlamps, stop lamps, turn signal lamps, tail lamps, reflex reflectors, parking brakes, rear view mirrors, windshields, seat belts, and vehicle identification numbers? for safety purposes. At present, each golf cart should have a displayed warning label confirming that they cannot be driven on public roads at a speed of more than 25 miles per hour.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Federal Highway Administration, as detailed in its Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, also allowed states to utilize warning signs about golf carts and other LSVs sharing the road with automobiles and other slow-moving transport utilities such as mopeds and bikes.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Presently, State laws govern on-road use of golf carts in their jurisdiction. Street legal golf carts, which are widely used at present in many places all over the country, should meet all safety equipment requirements, as well as operational and speed limits ? in full compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 500. <br /><br />Specifically, the government of the state of North Carolina has opened up these decisions and allowed each municipality to determine their own golf car street legal requirements; which do not have to adhere to federal guidelines on the subject.

In some instances that can enhance safety, but other times it can just slow you down. If you choose to operate your golf cart somewhere other than a golf course, you might need to get where you are going a little quicker.

If your cart is anywhere near cars, it is important that you are noticed. Adding taillights, headlights and turn signals are excellent ways to maintain safety standards when operating a golf cart.

There are important safety measures every person should take when driving their golf cart as it will protect them and the people around them. Here?s a look at some safety tips that will help you maintain your golf cart etiquette.<br /><br /><h4>Set the Parking Brake</h4>Whenever you step out of your <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/new-golf-carts/" target="_blank">Charlotte NC golf cart</a>, remember to set the parking brake. Neglecting this important safety function could send your cart rolling away and endangering everyone in its path. <br /><br /><h4>Don?t Drink and Drive</h4>Just because golf carts move at slower speeds does not mean they cannot do harm. Operators can also receive a DWI for driving while intoxicates as it is not only frowned upon, but it is also illegal. <br /><br /><h4>Use Hand Signals When Turning</h4>Not all golf carts are equipped with turn signals. As a safety precaution and form of courtesy, drivers should always use hand signals when making a turn. Also, keep in mind that turn signals are not always noticed by other drivers, so it?s a good idea to always use hand signals. <br /><br /><h4>Slow Down On Sharp Turns</h4>Most <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/4x4s-consumer-utility-vehicles/" target="_blank">Charlotte golf carts for sale</a> do not come with doors which makes falling out on a sharp turn a distinct possibility. Start to brake before making a sharp turn so that your speed is minimal and everyone in your car is safe. <br /><br /><h4>Ride the Brake</h4>When going down a hill, operators should always remember to ride the brake. This will slow the speed of your golf cart and not only make the ride safer for passengers, but safer for any golfers who may be randomly passing by. <br /><br /><h4>Stay Out of Bad Weather</h4>Golf carts tend to skid on wet surfaces and are also susceptible to lightning strikes. When the weather turns bad, head for a safer spot indoors as there a number of things that could go wrong.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4VkFkbMAtDE/V5d1FkdKyMI/AAAAAAAACII/RD__HoaMe24hqy9XCrE69bi7uT_evyxKwCLcB/s1600/4%2Bgolfcarts%2Bblurred%2Bbackground.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4VkFkbMAtDE/V5d1FkdKyMI/AAAAAAAACII/RD__HoaMe24hqy9XCrE69bi7uT_evyxKwCLcB/s640/4%2Bgolfcarts%2Bblurred%2Bbackground.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Carolina Golf Cars can help you find the right golf cart for you.

One of the more popular items thieves tend to look for when breaking into a home is actually golf carts. Don't make your golf cart anymore of a target by parking out in the open and unattended.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Proper Cleaning</h4>Owners may want to provide their golf cart with the best cleaning possible and that could lead to the use of a pressure washer. Avoid this method as a pressure washer can actually damage your golf cart. Stick with an ordinary wash using a simple garden hose. <br /><br /><br /><h4>Purchase an Alarm</h4>There are alarm systems that are designed for golf carts. They work the same way as a car alarm and sound when someone attempts to start the cart without a key. Sometimes, the presence of an alarm is enough to dissuade thieves as it means a lot of extra hassle for them. <br /><br /><br /><h4>Routine Inspection</h4>It?s a good idea to inspect your golf cart every now and then. This can be just a quick and simple check. For the most basic safety needs, make sure your brake pedal and accelerator pedal are not obstructed and can be pressed down with ease. For a more rigorous inspection and maintenance work, schedule an appointment with a <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/service-3/" target="_blank">golf car service center</a>.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Overnight Storage</h4>To make sure your battery does not inadvertently drain, check to ensure that all devices are powered off when storing your golf cart for the night. Also, make sure the parking brake is set. For long-term storage, be sure to change the tow/run switch from run to tow.  <br /><br /><br /><h4>Check Lights</h4>Being out in your golf cart after sunset means that you will have to rely on your lights and turn signals. That is why it is recommended to always check your lights each week to make sure they are working properly. Driving at night without lights could be dangerous for you and it also makes your golf cart more susceptible to damage. <br /><br /><br />Carolina Golf Cars is stocked with a long line of accessories to make sure your golf cart is fully protected. Our <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/custom-golf-carts/" target="_blank">Charlotte custom golf carts</a> can meet your exact specifications as well.

Here?s a look at some of the choices from <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte's Carolina Golf Cars</a> of the more popular accessories on a golf cart.<br /><br /><br /><h4><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SXPqm9POcTY/VwPh9Uv1psI/AAAAAAAABkU/QHjKJYyy3yQGIn9j07w5Pu75WcMO7xzPA/s1600/%255E31C7EA8F8FB222A8A36EF182D9F877475A0B8EE36694D80274%255Epimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="276" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SXPqm9POcTY/VwPh9Uv1psI/AAAAAAAABkU/QHjKJYyy3yQGIn9j07w5Pu75WcMO7xzPA/s320/%255E31C7EA8F8FB222A8A36EF182D9F877475A0B8EE36694D80274%255Epimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg" width="320" /></a>Headlights</h4>LED bulbs are gradually edging out halogens and becoming a more popular choice. One reason is because LED lights last up to five times longer than halogen bulbs. However, halogens are significantly lower in price, so it will initially save you money at the register. LED lights also use less energy and shine much brighter than halogens. The benefits of LED now greatly reign over the benefits of halogens, except when it comes to price. <br /><br /><br /><h4>Seat Kits</h4>There are many different kinds of seat kits to choose from, some of the steel and some of the aluminum varieties. Steel is the more durable of the two, although it is heavier which could have an effect on your top speed. One of the drawbacks with steel is that it is prone to rust whereas aluminum seats are free of any rust problems. Those who live in areas by the beach, where there is a lot of salt in the air, may want to go with the aluminum variety.<br /><br /><br /><h4>OEM or Custom-made</h4>When buying most types of <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/parts-accessories/" target="_blank">golf cart accessories</a>, it is important to be familiar with the term OEM which stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. This refers to parts and accessories made by the original cart manufacturer. There is also the option of choosing from custom accessories, which are made to your specific liking. This option is generally the more expensive of the two. Many times, options are greater in the custom made variety, but be prepared to pay.<br /><br /><br /><div><h4>Speakers</h4>Speakers can be just as important in a golf cart as they are in a car. And it is important to remember that quality matters when it comes to speakers. Quality extends beyond sound as some speakers are equipped with hardware that will not rust. Some speakers also have components that are sealed. This will protect the speakers from the unforgiving elements of nature. Speakers with a little flexibility also impact exactly where they can be mounted.<br /><br /><br />Parts and accessories from the leading manufacturers are widely available at Carolina Golf Cars, which is also a top choice for golf carts rentals,<a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/" target="_blank"> new/used golf carts for sale</a> and much more.

However, it does not come without following a certain protocol. Here is a look at all of the areas that need to be addressed before your golf cart can be considered legal to drive in the street.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Paperwork</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/" target="_blank">buy a golf cart</a> you will need the proper documentation, which includes all the pertinent information you will need to make it legal. There will be an ID number issued, which is similar to a VIN number on a motor vehicle. There will also be paperwork provided by the golf cart manufacturer which states its speeds. That is a requirement to classify it as a low-speed vehicle since that is how it will be registered.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Safety Functions</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Headlights are required as they provide safety at night, dusk, damn, and during times of bad weather. Taillights are also a must as they alert any vehicles travelling behind the golf cart of its presence on the road. Turn signals are another requirement, just as they would be in any other kind of motor vehicle. Seat belts are one more safety function that is mandatory. There must be enough seat belts for each passenger, which generally tops off at four.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Visibility&nbsp;</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to be considered <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/cart-sales/street-legal-lsvs/" target="_blank">street legal, golf carts</a> have to be equipped with side view and rear view mirrors. There also has to be a windshield installed, one that is durable enough to maintain the safety of the passengers while also providing clear visibility for the driver.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Brakes</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Front and rear brakes are required and they must also be independent brakes.

With some upgrades you can better tailor your cart to your needs and desires, whether they be functional or aesthetic. Not all golf cart upgrades require major engine or body work and not all upgrades have to cost a fortune. Here is a look at some affordable upgrades that can change the entire look of your golf cart from <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/" target="_blank">Carolina Golf Cars of Charlotte</a>.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Lift Kits</h4>Having a lift kit added to your golf cart is an easy way to make a bold statement. By raising the body of the golf cart further from the ground you will gain more ground clearance. This means there is less risk of bottoming out and potential damaging your carts, especially when driving off-road or on uneven terrain. Lift kits are also beneficial to those operating a street legal golf cart, A.K.A low speed vehicle. The added height a lift kit creates will make the golf cart more visible to regular motor vehicles, certainly those with their own lift kits.<br /><br /><br /><h4><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-me5EQZWqAbg/Vtcsmeo7J-I/AAAAAAAABcI/thwL17d0_Mw/s1600/bigstock-Golf-Car-2082643.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-me5EQZWqAbg/Vtcsmeo7J-I/AAAAAAAABcI/thwL17d0_Mw/s320/bigstock-Golf-Car-2082643.jpg" width="320" /></a>Hubcaps and Rims</h4>The selection of hub caps and rims for golf carts is just as extensive as it is for cars. Turbine hubcaps or chromed rims are just a couple of varieties that can really make your golf cart stand out from the rest of the pack. <a href="http://carolinagolfcars.com/parts-accessories/" target="_blank">http://carolinagolfcars.com/parts-accessories/</a> has a variety of hubcaps, rims, and tires to select from.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Seat Cushions </h4>Deluxe seat cushions can provide your golf cart with a completely different look. These are available in a wide array of colors. Brightening up the inside if your golf cart is a cheaper alternative to getting a custom paint job. But combining colored seat cushions with a custom paint job will really enhance the look of your cart. <br /><br /><br /><h4>Steering Wheel</h4>There are lots of different steering wheels you can incorporate to your golf cart. A wood-grain steering wheel can provide a more elegant look while camouflage steering wheels go great with off-road custom golf carts used for hunting. Steering wheel covers are also available in wide varieties. <br /><br /><br /><h4>Custom Paint</h4>Why settled for any ordinary color golf cart when your cart can truly stand out? Custom paint jobs are pretty much unlimited. If you can think it, someone can paint it. This is not only limited to color, but it extends to designs as well. If you want a golf cart with flames on the side, there is no reason you cannot have it.<br /><br /><br />Carolina Golf Cars has the capability to provide you with the golf cart of your dreams.
