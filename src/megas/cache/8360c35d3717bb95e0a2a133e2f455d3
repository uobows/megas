<p>Can one improve upon the Ferrari Enzo?</p>
<p>This was the question Maserati faced when they decided to produce their own supercar. As Maserati was again coming into its own in the early 2000s, the company looked to make waves in the industry with an incredible, world-beating machine. Like Ferrari, Maserati was owned by Fiat S.p.A., so it only made sense for them to utilize the platform of the incredible 2002 Enzo, the gold standard of supercars, to their advantage. But the question was, how could they improve upon a car that was already so spectacular in all regards?</p>
<p>Beginning with Enzo underpinnings, Frank Stephenson swathed the MC12 in its own unique bodywork. The design shared little of that of the Enzo and offered the car a look and character that were dramatically all its own. Furthermore, the MC12 featured a removable hardtop, allowing its driver to get that much closer to the sound and fury of the car?s incredible engine, which sat just inches behind their fortunate ears. Thanks to its newer proportions and especially large rear spoiler, the MC12 also created more downforce than an Enzo. It was only natural that it would be geared towards racing.</p>
<p>Unlike the Enzo, Maserati campaigned the MC12 in the FIA?s GT and GT1 World Championship series and saw considerable success. The MC12 helped Vitaphone racing secure five consecutive Team Championships and a sixth for the first season of GT1 in 2010. Additionally, Maserati won the Manufacturer?s Cup in 2005 and 2007 and six Drivers? Championships, four in the FIA GT Championship from 2006 to 2009, one for the 2006 Italian GT Championship, and another within the newly formed FIA GT1 class in 2010.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/2005-Maserati-MC12/2005-Maserati-MC12-38.jpg" width="3840" height="2561" /></p>
<p>NUMBER 31 OF 50</p>
<p>As was the case at Ferrari with the Enzo, Maserati essentially hand-selected the MC12?s original owners, limiting them to the most loyal supporters of the factory. Among those was the late Benny Caiola, a well-known New York-based enthusiast and collector of Italian supercars, to whom the MC12 offered here was originally delivered, which he in turn had federalized for use as a street car in the U.S.</p>
<p>The MC12 created a clamor among Maserati enthusiasts to own what was, unequivocally, the greatest road going automobile that the company had ever built, as well as Maserati?s first mid-engined street-legal car. The company had intended for the car to make an impact, and it did so, in true Ferrari fashion, by strictly limiting the number that would be built to only 25 cars. Each vehicle was hand-finished, with exacting attention to detail, and finished in a brilliant two-tone blue and white color scheme. However, apparently the urging of customers proved too much for Maserati to resist. Looking to not only please their demanding customers but also to celebrate the car?s racing success, Maserati eventually produced a second run of 25 cars, for a total of a still very limited 50 examples.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/2005-Maserati-MC12/2005-Maserati-MC12-37.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>Mr. Caiola was well known for driving his cars on the track and in various events with skill and vigor, including his Ferrari FXX in the company?s Corse Clienti program. He could no doubt handle the car?s 6.0-liter V-12 and 630 horsepower with ease, hence why Maserati selected him for the MC12. However, this MC12 saw little road use and was instead often shown at various concours events, even taking Best in Class honors at the Manhasset Concours d?Elegance in 2007. It was always subject to the best of care while in Mr. Caiola?s ownership, including proper and routine service, ensuring that it would remain ?like-new? throughout. Caiola intended his prized example, the 31st of 50, to be preserved exactly as it had come from the factory for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Caiola?s unfortunate and untimely passing, the current and only second owner acquired the MC12 through Autosport Designs, of Huntington Station, New York, in 2011. He has continued the process of preservation and regular service that had been started by his predecessor. From the time of purchase, the MC12 has traveled under 40 kilometers, all from transit and the occasional short drive to ensure that everything remains in proper running condition. Most recently, Maserati of Central Florida completed an engine-out service in 2013, which involved replacing the clutch, and the MC12 has accumulated just over 10 kilometers since; as a result, it remains ready to drive at a moment?s notice. The MC12 is accompanied by a complete set of books, its proper car cover, and service records from its current ownership.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/2005-Maserati-MC12/2005-Maserati-MC12-46.jpg" width="3840" height="2106" /></p>
<p>The MC12, undoubtedly the most desirable and most exciting car Maserati has produced to date, not only gave Maserati a firm foothold in the supercar arena, but it also reintroduced the Trident to international racing with exceptional results. As a result, it is also one of the most significant modern Italian supercars.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as superb examples of the Ferrari Enzo, of which 400 were produced, have rocketed past the $3-million mark, one should consider that the MC12 is substantially rarer still. The model, with only 50 examples built, is statistically faster around a race track, and very importantly, it offers open-top motoring. This car?s offering, with 767 original kilometers on its odometer, marks an almost unbelievably attractive opportunity, not only for the driving enthusiast but also for the collector in search of rarity and value. Add to all that the distinguished provenance and documented care and service that came from Benny Caiola?s ownership, and the astute motorist is left with a desirable supercar, one with a portfolio that is nothing short of perfect.</p>

<p>?Get down!?</p>
<p>Gunfire erupts and James Bond jumps into a white Japanese sports car. The car speeds onto the streets of Tokyo, its twin-cam straight-six wailing away as Bond tries to escape the gunmen in hot pursuit. From the city streets, the car heads up the mountain roads, showcasing not only its straight-line speed but its finesse around the corners.</p>
<p>That was how the world was introduced to Toyota?s first true sports car, the 2000GT. Even though the 2000GT featured in You Only Live Twice was a convertible (a one-off built for the movie, to allow the 6?2? Sean Connery to fit inside), the 2000GT clearly left a lasting impression on the millions of viewers. Toyota had never produced a car like this, one designed to compete with Europe and America?s best GT cars, but it was a gamble that paid off.</p>
<p>While the majority of 2000GT production remained in Japan, a handful of cars made their way to other countries around the globe. The United States received only 15 percent of said production and perhaps would have received more if Toyota had built the 1,000 examples that it initially intended to. Ultimately, only 351 examples were constructed by the time production ceased, as sales were limited largely due to the cost of the car, which was $7,000, when buyers could have a Jaguar E-Type or Porsche 911 at the time for $1,000 less. Justifying the cost of the 2000GT was difficult, as there were much more established marques and models on the market. Regardless, Toyota proved that Japan could build a sports car that was capable of competing with the West.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1967-Toyota-2000GT/1967-Toyota-2000GT-03.jpg" width="3840" height="1904" /></p>
<p>CHASSIS NUMBER 10083: AMERICA?S FIRST 2000GT</p>
<p>Keen historians will be quick to note that two pre-production, left-hand-drive 2000GTs were constructed before chassis 10083?chassis 10081 and 10082. Both were originally built as right-hand-drive examples but were later converted to left-hand drive, eventually selling to Belgium and Denmark, respectively. Chassis 10083, on the other hand, was the first 2000GT designated as type 36011 (designating left-hand drive), with production code 20 (designating U.S. delivery).</p>
<p>The car was destined for the West Coast and shipped new by special-order to Toyota of San Francisco. It was purchased by Scott Pfefer, a well-known sports car enthusiast living in the Bay Area, and was registered on California ?black plates? VOH 932. It is reported that Pfefer drove the car frequently and had it regularly serviced at Toyota of San Francisco. During his 10 years of ownership, he drove this 2000GT nearly 66,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>The car was then purchased in the late 1970s by Oggie Davis, an authorized Toyota dealer in California, and was then acquired by Alex Sokoloff, of Palo Alto, sometime thereafter, until it eventually joined the collection of Jim Thelan, who amazingly owned another 2000GT. Several years later, the car was sold by Thelen to a Japanese enthusiast, who retained it for some 20 years before its acquisition by the present owner.</p>
<p>The 2000GT has never been fully restored or involved in an accident, and it remains in excellent condition to this day. After being purchased by its current custodian, the original wheels were fitted with new tires, the wheel bearings were replaced, and the Solex carburetors were rebuilt. The car, showing 68,953 kilometers at the time of cataloguing, which could very well be original, appears in remarkable condition considering its age, which is clearly a direct result of careful maintenance in the hands of enthusiastic owners. Aside from a repaint early in its life, the car appears to be almost completely original.</p>
<p>Chassis number 10083, presented in vastly unrestored and original condition and boasting known history as the very first U.S.-specification example, is undoubtedly one of the nicest 2000GTs in existence and among the most significant for an American buyer. The opportunity to add this exceptional example to one?s collection will likely not present itself again anytime soon.</p>

<p>A full-size styling mock-up was developed after consultation with four professional stylists, who included Don Johnson, the former GM stylist who was responsible for the final version of the Zimmer automobile. The sub-structure is an all-aluminum space-frame chassis and body, making extensive use of proprietary high-strength, heat-treated aluminum extrusions. The special aluminum suspension A-frames and knuckles are heat-treated, then X-rayed and dye-penetrant tested to detect any porosity. Anti-squat and anti-dive geometry are included, along with 13.2-inch four-wheel disc brakes. The completed car weighs in at a comparatively light 3,750 pounds.</p>
<p>Power is supplied by a 573 horsepower, 525-cubic inch, all-aluminum OHV V-12. The engine was tested over a five-year period and is equipped with Delco electronic-port fuel injection, dual catalytic converters and oxygen sensors, and Delco powertrain control modules. Full-time all-wheel drive is managed by a Borg Warner transfer case with a viscous clutch and a 35/65 torque split front/rear. A GM 4L80E four-speed electronic-shift automatic transmission was chosen for effortless touring. Performance is quoted at 0?60 mph in 4.8 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.5 seconds.</p>

<p>Inside, you?ll find fine leather upholstery, hand-finished dark walnut veneers with aluminum backing, power front seats, and power windows and locks. Comfort items also include automatic temperature control, full instrumentation, and an AM-FM radio with a CD player and changer.</p>
<p>Included in the purchase of the vehicle are spare parts, such as door glass, suspension knuckles and A-frames, and taillight lenses, along with a list of components with part numbers and suppliers? names. Historical notes and materials will be provided with the car, as well as many additional photographs and original artwork.</p>

<p>Looking to reinvigorate sales and interest in the Aston Martin brand, Ford once again teamed up with Zagato in 2002 to create a limited-production, coachbuilt grand touring car in the spirit of the DB4GT Zagato of the 1960s and the V8 Vantage Zagato of the 1980s.</p>

<p>As the United States market was not offered the DB7 Zagato coupe, it was only right that Aston Martin and Zagato offer another limited-production product for their American clients, and thus, the DB AR1 was born. First shown at the 2003 Los Angeles Auto Show, the DB AR1 was an exciting fully open roadster that remained largely similar to its closed sibling, and it was instantly regarded as one of the best designs that both Aston Martin and Zagato had ever produced.</p>
<p>Finished from new in Tungsten Silver over Light Tan, the beautiful example offered here was the 37th of the 99 DB AR1 roadsters built. With only 800 actual miles, it remains in excellent condition throughout. It is complete with the original pair of umbrellas (mounted inside of the trunk lid).</p>
<p>The DB AR1 remains as popular and iconic today as when it was first built, and opportunities to acquire one are few and far between. This example, in excellent colors and with low original mileage, would be a superb addition to any Aston Martin connoisseur?s stable.</p>

<p>Although Lincoln decided to include Zephyr in the lineup for 1937, the company continued to offer its prestigious Model K in 17 custom body styles. Perhaps influenced by Cord, the stylists saw simplicity as a key feature. The front headlamps were now of an art deco teardrop design that had been streamlined into the front fenders, and the V-front windscreens were fitted on all standard bodies.

From an engineering standpoint, the V-12 engine was fitted with hydraulic lifters and a different cam contour, and it was placed further forward, sitting on altered engine mounts.</p>
<p>The car offered here, chassis number K-7816, is one of only forty-eight factory aluminum-bodied two-window sedans built to style number 354A on the 1937 Model K chassis. Today, it is one of only two known to survive. According to the owner, its production card, as provided by the Benson Ford Research Center, identifies it as having been originally delivered on January 22, 1937, in Richmond, Virginia, and finished in special-order Brewster Green DK (Dark). Speculation that has long traveled with the Lincoln suggests that it was originally delivered to the State Department; while documentation of this has never been located, Model Ks were certainly a favorite of the U.S. government during the FDR years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1937-Lincoln-ModelK-Sedan/1937-Lincoln-ModelK-Sedan-16.jpg" width="3840" height="2559" /></p>
<p>The car?s known history indicates that in the late 1940s it made its way to California, and in the 1960s, it was purchased by Owen Owens for his famous Ragtime Museum in Emeryville. It remained in the Owens Collection until shortly before Mr. Owens?s passing in 1978. It was then acquired by a Mr. Milliken, who had the paint refreshed, the front seat reupholstered, and a mechanical restoration performed. In the early 1980s, the car became an award winner at several Northern California concours d?elegance and was enjoyed by several other West Coast caretakers.</p>
<p>The current owner notes that the car?s 88,520 miles are original and that it has all of its original equipment, including its engine, transmission, the entire interior upholstery and woodwork (except for the front seats), tools, and exterior components; also, all interior lights and accessories are reported to function well. There is an extensive file of all repair and restoration documents on the car, which goes back many decades, as well as historical production records. The car received new tubes and tires in January 2007, and extensive work was performed to restore shine to the paint, much of which was original. The engine compartment was refinished, new polished aluminum heads were installed, exhaust manifolds were recently redone with new ceramic, the entire car was properly rewired with a completely new harness, and a high-speed rear end gear set was installed in the differential, as was a new clutch. The Lincoln reportedly scored 98.25 points at the 2009 CCCA Grand Classic in Scottsdale and received its Primary First. The owner notes that it runs and drives well, and he uses it regularly, including in a 2011 CCCA CARavan to the Grand Canyon and back.</p>
<p>This is a very special and very functional car. It is a perfect car for either an entry into the classic car hobby or to add to any Lincoln collection.</p>

<p>A particular highlight of the mid-1930s, and arguably the height of the French coachbuilt era, was Figoni et Falaschi?s introduction of the Goutte d?Eau, or teardrop streamliners, which were built as coupes and cabriolets on both Delahaye and Talbot-Lago chassis.</p>
<p>Both pre- and post-war, Figoni et Falaschi?s stand at the Paris Salon was a ?must-see? attraction. Although teardrop cars were made in relatively small numbers, they were so immediately eye-catching that they became instant icons, and they remain so today. This particular example of Figoni coachwork was built on Delahaye?s Type 135 chassis, a model that was introduced in 1935 at the Paris Salon and was enthusiastically received. It proved delightful to drive, producing 160 horsepower in this most-powerful MS configuration. Of its performance, <i>The Motor</i> wrote in 1938, ?There are few cars with such superb roadholding and steering, such performance, and such instantly responsive controls.?</p>
<p>CHASSIS NUMBER 60112</p>
<p>The Delahaye 135 MS Coupe on offer here, chassis number 60112, was clothed with Figoni body number 729 for the 1938 Paris Salon, where it shared the Figoni et Falaschi stand with a fabulous V-12-powered Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe-61.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>It seems likely that this Delahaye was hidden from occupying forces during World War II, as it was not discovered until 1964, in the ownership of its second known owner, Madame Michele Gautier of La Seyne-sur-Mer, a few miles from the Mediterranean port of Toulon in Southern France. The car was hidden behind a hedge of bulrushes and discovered by none other than Antoine Raffaelli, the most well-known enthusiast for prying Bugattis out of their pre-war hiding places, particularly around Europe and France. At the time of the discovery, it was wearing registration 308 M 6, which was from the nearby Alpes-Maritimes region. Given that the number is so low, it is likely that it dates back to the original ownership. Only in 1983 was it registered to Madame Gautier, under 740 AN 83, likely to establish her ownership of the car prior to its pending sale.</p>
<p>Rafaelli finally acquired chassis 60112 from Madame Gautier in 1985, and it was again registered in Alpes-Maritimes, this time as 3506 VJ 06. He then delivered the Coupe to the workshops of Jacques Conforti, of the Quartier du Port in Nice, for a meticulous restoration, which took place between 1986 and 1987. The find was documented in the French publication <i>La Vie de l?Auto</i>, when the restorer was reaching out to confirm that this was indeed the 1938 Paris salon car. During the restoration, it was found that the skin and wood had suffered from exposure to the elements, so the wood framing was largely replaced and the sensuous shape of the skin was recreated in steel. Minor styling updates, which are presumed to have been performed in the 1940s, include a restyled narrower grille, and chrome embellishments that were added to the leading edges of the front bumpers were retained.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe-22.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>Raffaelli sold the car in 1990, and it was in the care of two owners until 1998. That year, the car joined Peter Kaus?s renowned Rosso Bianco Collection in Aschaffenburg, Germany, where it remained until 2006, when it was purchased by American collector John O?Quinn.</p>
<p>RESTORATION</p>
<p>In its new American ownership, the restoration on the Delahaye was found to be aging and a fresh one was commissioned. Mr. O?Quinn hired Parisian Delahaye expert Benoit Bocquet as a consultant on the restoration, who recommended Atelier Automobiles Anciennes Dominique Tessier to assume the task. They embarked on a two-year restoration, which was truly a labor of love, with the strictest attention to detail being paid.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe/1938-Delahaye-135MS-Coupe-14.jpg" width="3840" height="2559" /></p>
<p>The car was brought down to its bare chassis before a meticulous rebuild was conducted on the body, chassis, engine, transmission, and interior, with work being performed on quite literally every single nut and bolt. From the running gear to the beautifully retrimmed upholstery, the results were spectacular. As a result of period photographs provided to Bocquet by Mr. Claude Figoni, Tessier was able to restore the nose and grille back to its configuration as seen at the 1938 Paris Auto Salon, complete with vee?d front bumper and tri-color grille.</p>
<p>The grille is particularly important and unique to this car, as Joseph Figoni, an Italian national who immigrated to France years earlier, designed it to show his patriotism toward his adoptive homeland of France, particularly during the tumultuous build-up leading to World War II.</p>
<p>The provided photos also helped determine that the exterior was originally finished in a light Ivory color, as paint limitations at the time would have never produced a truly white car. Correspondingly, the interior was determined to be a deep red leather interior with white piping and it was finished accordingly, as seen today.</p>
<p>Although the cosmetic appearance of the car was fabulous, the Delahaye had not been driven much following the completion of the restoration due to Mr. O?Quinn?s untimely passing in 2009. Since coming into possession of its current owner, who is also an astute collector, the restoration was thoroughly shaken down in an exhaustive four-month process to make sure that every element of its performance was as it should be.</p>
<p>Work performed on the car included the removal of the gearbox for the installation of a new flywheel ring gear, the rebuilding of the starter, and the cleaning and synchronization of the Solex carburetors. In addition, new wheels were manufactured using the original hubs, correct hose clamps were installed, and the door latches and window cranks were sorted for smoother operation. A number of parts were rechromed, including the grille, bumpers, rumble seat steps, hood hardware, hub knockoffs, and several other smaller pieces of hardware. All wiring and electrical elements were checked and sorted where necessary, including the instrumentation, horns, battery, and cables.</p>
<p>As Figoni et Falaschi Teardrop Coupes come to market, they always attract intense interest wherever they appear. With a combination of a perfectionist restoration with subsequent sorting, intriguing history, flamboyant bodywork, and 100-mph performance, this Delahaye is a perfect entrant for some of the most important concours events around the world.</p>

Brian Lister had the money and the engineering know-how, so his first racing car, built in the mid-1950s with the able assistance of Don Moore and Archie Scott-Brown, was an incredible success, collecting a 1st or 2nd place finish wherever it roamed. Its success with MG and Bristol power was such that Lister soon had the financial backing of Shell/BP and a deal with Jaguar to supply engines for a car that would be capable of winning the World Sports Car Championship. The result, the Lister-Jaguar, was also a world beater, and it was eventually developed into the now-legendary ?Knobbly,? nicknamed for its curvaceous but rather bumpy bodywork. Nothing performed like a Knobbly Lister?and nothing quite looked like one, either.</p>
<p>Eventually, as often happened in the 1960s, a U.S.-built engine was dropped into a British-built sports car. The result was the Lister-Chevrolet, which boasted hairy performance. More than competitive, it was, in fact, ?the car to beat.? The Listers swept the SCCA Championships in 1958 and 1959. Unfortunately, with the success of the Lister-Chevrolet, the ?ultimate? Lister came at the end of the company?s life, as production wound down in 1959 after fewer than 50 cars had been produced, only 16 of which were Chevrolet-powered.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://www.desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1959-Lister-Chevrolet/1959-Lister-Chevrolet-07.jpg" width="3400" height="2267" /></p>
<p>Virtually forgotten for many years, the car?s fame has recently caught a second wind, as a new generation of owners has come to appreciate the performance that once delighted friends and terrified enemies. Delightfully, the short supply of Listers when new, and the relatively few that have survived the hard life of track cars, has added to their increasing desirability. They are wonderful vintage racing machines, and they remain capable of holding their own against anything else Europe has to offer.</p>
<p>The Lister-Chevrolet offered here is BHL127, supplied new in 1959 as a Frank Costin-bodied car with a Chevrolet engine, and it was reportedly owned in its early years by Chuck Howard and Tracy Bird and raced at tracks like Road America and Elkhart Lake. Definitive records on Listers are in short supply for various reasons, with no factory documentation available for any car, but this car?s identity as BHL127 is fortunately supported by the lettering stamped into the chassis in Brian Lister?s unique, instantly identifiable font.</p>
<p>The car was definitively owned later by Jim Mullen, and documentation from the 1970s indicates that it was approved by the Vintage Sports Car Club of America. Not long afterward, it journeyed to England and was owned by Barry Simpson and David Clark, and later Walter Becker, of Switzerland. At some point, the car was rebodied with its present Knobbly-style bodywork, believed to date back to Simpson?s ownership and to have hailed from his shop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://www.desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1959-Lister-Chevrolet/1959-Lister-Chevrolet-26.jpg" width="3500" height="2333" /></p>
<p>Any lack of contemporary racing history was obliterated when the car, rebuilt by Mark Lewis Design Engineering, won the BRDC Championship outright, when it left such worthy competition as Cobras and E-Types in its dust at the British Grand Prix support race, and when it won the Sussex Trophy race at Goodwood twice. In the past 10 years, this car has achieved 34 top three finishes at some of the most prestigious races in the world, setting all-time lap records for a ?50s sports car at Oulton Park, Goodwood, and Spa. This car has seen serious racing and is a multiple winner with the BRDC, the Stirling Moss Trophy, the VSCC, and the HGPCA, never failing to leave without a place among the winners.</p>
<p>The engine of the car is presently built to produce about 435 horsepower at 6,400 rpm, as tuned for its most recent racing season. The lightweight Knobbly bodywork makes this a very, very fast automobile indeed. The car is accompanied by a dynamometer sheet that confirms the horsepower reading, as well as the proper FIA paperwork, a large binder of historical and technical information, and an extensive spares package, which includes, among many other things, a spare engine, a gearbox, two wheels, and an exhaust system.</p>
<p>Simply put, this Lister-Chevrolet made a lot of people in considerably more famous, considerably less quick racing cars very angry as it tore through the European racing circuit, and it has been called one of the fastest 1950s racing cars in existence. It is now positioned to possibly do the very same in historic racing in the States, from which its roaring engine came, and where it would both be eligible for many of the most prestigious events and fully capable of winning them.</p>

<p>Road &amp; Track magazine?s founder, John R. Bond, once said, ?A little knowledge about cars can be dangerous.? Preston Thomas Tucker was an industry veteran with a lot of knowledge about cars, and he used that knowledge to dream bigger than just about anyone else in the U.S. automobile industry after World War II. The reasons why he did not succeed remain controversial, but success is not only measured in dollars and production numbers. It is also measured in lasting memories, and for many, the Tucker 48 remains a rolling symbol of the American dream and one of the most advanced early post-war automobiles.</p>
<p>Tucker?s concept for his car was revolutionary. He intended to use a Ben Parsons-designed rear-mounted engine with all-independent Torsilastic rubber-sprung suspension and disc brakes on all four wheels. Drive was to be by twin torque converters, one at each rear wheel. The body design was penned by former Auburn Automobile Company designer Alex Tremulis, and it incorporated numerous safety features that Tucker promoted, including a windshield that would pop out in an accident, a wide space under the dash pad into where front seat passengers could duck before a collision, and a center-mounted third headlight that would turn with the front wheels.</p>
<p>Early in the production cycle, the Tucker saw some of those dreams evaporate. The safety features survived, but the Parsons 589 engine and direct torque converter drive proved impractical. Tucker purchased Air Cooled Motors, a New York manufacturer of small aircraft engines, and reworked their product for water cooling. He installed it in his car, along with a four-speed transaxle borrowed from the Cord 810 and 812.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1948-Tucker-48/1948-Tucker-48-16.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>Eventually, 51 examples of the Tucker 48 were assembled, and of those were the original ?Tin Goose? prototype and 50 pilot-production cars. Public acclaim and desire for the new design was at a fever pitch. Unfortunately, it was all for naught. The Tucker Corporation came under the scrutiny of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The wheels of government ground slowly, and by the time Tucker and his executives were eventually declared ?not guilty? in early 1950, the public had lost faith and Tucker had lost his factory. The car once nicknamed the ?Torpedo? had been, effectively, torpedoed.</p>
<p>A little knowledge about cars can be dangerous, but it can also result in something so full of passion and fascination that it can survive bureaucracy and time to become an icon of its age and the ultimate validation of its creator. It is the American dream on four wheels.</p>
<p>TUCKER NUMBER 1036</p>
<p>A factory report dated October 28, 1948, held in the Tucker archives at the Gilmore Car Museum, indicates that chassis number 1036 had been completed on October 20, with body number 33 and engine number 335-85, and it was one of a dozen cars painted Maroon (paint code 600). No transmission was listed, as it is believed that this was one of the over a dozen Tuckers that remained unfinished and were waiting for transmissions when the factory closed. This is confirmed by the final factory inventory, dated March 3, 1949, which shows the car being in factory building number four with no transmission and having a price/value of $2,000.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1948-Tucker-48/1948-Tucker-48-19.jpg" width="3840" height="2559" /></p>
<p>Along with the other cars, chassis number 1036 was eventually completed by faithful Tucker employees somewhat ?off the record.? On October 18, 1950, this car, along with the other Tuckers built and all the other contents of the factory, went to auction at a sale conducted by Samuel L. Winternitz and Company, which took place on site at 7401 South Cicero Avenue. The car is believed to have been sold to the St. Louis area, where it was finally outfitted with a transmission and made roadworthy.</p>
<p>Around 1951, this car and a second Tucker were given to Ova Elijah Stephens, of Denver, Colorado. Stephens was known to the Denver public as ?Smilin? Charlie,? a nickname bestowed because the well-known underworld figure was never known to smile. He accepted the two Tuckers as down payments on the sale of the Silver Star Saloon, a watering hole and brothel in the small Centennial State town of Flippin, as is documented in surviving IRS records, copies of which are on file.</p>
<p>Smilin? Charlie had no real use for the Tuckers, and chassis number 1036 was sold through Hugo Sills Motors, a Hudson dealer in the town of Littleton, to Rex McKelvy. In a lengthy interview for the August 12, 1988, issue of the Rocky Mountain News, McKelvy recalled the Tucker as ?a fabulous car and good performer,? which had only 20 miles recorded when he purchased it!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1948-Tucker-48/1948-Tucker-48-28.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>With Preston Tucker?s downfall still fresh in the public?s consciousness, one of his cars was a ?must? for the roadside antique automobile museums popping up all over America in the 1950s. Accordingly, when Denver businessman Arthur H. Christiansen opened his Colorado Car Museum at the foot of Lookout Mountain in 1958, he purchased Tucker number 1036 from McKelvy. Unfortunately, Christiansen?s museum lasted for only a year before its doors were shuttered and its cars were sold at auction.</p>
<p>Tucker number 1036 was acquired at the auction for $3,500 by Wayne McKinley, a successful Chevrolet dealer from O?Fallon, Illinois, and charter member of the Tucker Automobile Club of America. Mr. McKinley would be the Tucker?s longest-term owner, selling it after a quarter century in 1986 to Ken Behring?s Blackhawk Collection in Danville, California. In December 1989, the car was restored to its present appearance by Bob Holland?s Phaetons and Fins, of Menlo Park, California. A year later, it passed to Nobuyo Sawayama, of Osaka, Japan, for a figure widely reported as $500,000, which is believed to have been the highest price paid for a Tucker at the time.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Tucker was acquired by Bob Pond. For a decade, it remained as the centerpiece of his legendary collection, spending many years on prominent display, alongside his other most prized possessions, at the Palm Springs Air Museum.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1948-Tucker-48/1948-Tucker-48-39.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>The car is still wearing Mr. Holland?s restoration and is finished in an eye-catching shade of metallic bronze, which believed to be the 1966 Ford Emberglo. Its chrome and paint still have a nice shine, and the correct broadcloth interior shows only light wear; in fact, the broadcloth is believed to be the original material from 1948! Importantly, the car retains not only a proper Tucker Y-1 transmission?the gearbox that it was meant to have when new?but also the correct, proper late dashboard switchgear and Kaiser-sourced door handles. Only 1,914 miles are recorded, likely the actual mileage covered since new in the ownership of Smith, McKelvy, McKinley, Behring, and Pond.</p>
<p>To acquire one of the most legendary American cars is a rare opportunity. To acquire one with such well-known and utterly fascinating history is especially priceless. The saying remains as true today as in 1948: ?Don?t Let a Tucker Pass You By.?</p>

<p>The M1 was the most exotic BMW street car ever built. It was a limited-production, virtually hand-built car that was essentially a homologation special, and it featured a tube frame and utilized state-of-the-art technology underneath the radical Giugiaro-designed body. The road going M1 was built on the race-spec chassis, which was fitted with unequal length lateral links, alloy uprights, concentric coil springs, and anti-roll bars in the front and rear. Just 456 examples were built, including a number of race-prepared cars for rallying and the BMW M1 Procar Championship.</p>
<p>BMW Motorsport initially planned to build enough M1s to meet the regulation for Group 5; however, rule changes by Fdration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) required a minimum of 400 examples be built to meet Group 4 regulations before the car could be homologated for Group 5. Rather than delay their racing program, BMW decided to create a one-make series while they continued further development. The Procar Championship was announced in the spring of 1978, along with the official unveiling of the M1 road car.</p>
<p>While the Procar series only lasted two seasons, from 1979 to 1980, its popularity was undeniable. With their flared fenders, imposing front spoiler, massive rear wing, and incredible power, the M1?s presence on the race track left a lasting impression.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1980-BMW-M1-AHG-Studie/1980-BMW-M1-AHG-28.jpg" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>In 1982, after the series ended and production for the M1 was completed, Peter Gartemann, the president and owner of the German BMW dealer AHG, had the brilliant idea of creating a limited-design study that was based on the look of the Procar M1s but was intended for the street. This option, which was open to well-to-do BMW customers, involved having the AHG Motorsport division take an owner?s standard road going M1 and transform it into the ultimate Procar-style street fighter. From the outside, the changes are clearly apparent, but the modifications didn?t simply end with the race-inspired body.</p>
<p>The AHG M1 Studie cars received adjustable racing suspension and three-piece 16-inch BBS wheels, which were 8-inches wide up front and 9-inches wide at the rear. The engine was duly uprated to 350 horsepower and mated to a special racing clutch and a new exhaust system, to fall in line with the M1?s new looks. The car was still very much intended for the street, as its interior was swathed in leather and the stereo system was enhanced with additional speakers. However, it wasn?t the menacing body or the upgraded trim that made these cars truly unique. AHG commissioned the renowned German paint shop of Hermann Altmiks to finish each M1 in a unique scheme per the customer?s request.</p>
<p>This particular M1 started life much like any other standard version. According to BMW Classic, chassis 4301090 was built in 1979 and delivered on August 30 of that year to BMW dealer Schneider in Bielefeld, Germany. The original color was White (206). While its initial history is unknown, the owner of this M1 at the time must have decided that they wanted to further separate their already capable supercar from the other 455 examples, and AHG was just the place to do that. The M1 Studie package was added to the car, even though the cost was prohibitively expensive, and as the modifications were TV-certified in Germany, they required extensive testing and approvals, which only added to the cost of development. Allegedly, it was the rear spoiler that was the costliest part to get approved. Due to the limited nature of the AHG package, it is believed that only 10 such examples were created, with each one unique in their own right.</p>
<p>This AHG Studie is finished in the iconic BMW Motorsport livery, and it has led a well-cared-for life. It would ultimately find its way into the famous Ed Weaver Collection in Dalton, Georgia, where it resided until 1995. In 2011, it was purchased by renowned collector Don Davis. Soon thereafter, it was acquired by the AE Collection in Burbank, California. The collection is known for their rare Japanese and European sports cars, and this unique M1 was very much at home amongst the other low-mileage BMWs. This example, believed to be an original AHG M1 Studie, displays less than 7,000 kilometers on its odometer. The car features AHG M1 markings throughout the body, and the original ?altmiks lackdesign? signature is painted just below the taillight. The custom-finished exterior only shows minor signs of aging, while the leather-trimmed interior remains in excellent overall condition.</p>
<p>The incredible M1 in one of BMW?s scarcest and most iconic variations, and this awesome AHG Studie example is a German performance monster of its era.</p>

Well-documented history in the SAAC Shelby Registry Factory Le Mans stripe delete and black Magnum 500 wheels Factory four-speed transmission Wonderful presence and presentation Carroll Shelby&#8217;s initial street-going Mustang GT350s of 1965 sold briskly, but since they were essentially thinly disguised race cars, early buyers complained about harshness, noise, and rattles. As a result, the 1966 GT350 became more user-friendly, as it had a host of mechanical revisions that softened the edges and made the cars more tractable. Exterior changes included Plexiglas quarter windows and the scoops and ducting necessary to help cool the rear brakes. Mechanically, the engine remained the same: a Shelby-prepared, 306-brake horsepower, solid-lifter, 289-cubic inch Ford V-8 with a Holley four-barrel carburetor.

<p>Carroll Shelby&#8217;s initial street-going Mustang GT350s of 1965 sold briskly, but since they were essentially thinly disguised race cars, early buyers complained about harshness, noise, and rattles. As a result, the 1966 GT350 became more user-friendly, as it had a host of mechanical revisions that softened the edges and made the cars more tractable. Exterior changes included Plexiglas quarter windows and the scoops and ducting necessary to help cool the rear brakes. Mechanically, the engine remained the same: a Shelby-prepared, 306-brake horsepower, solid-lifter, 289-cubic inch Ford V-8 with a Holley four-barrel carburetor. The Borg-Warner T10 four-speed manual transmission remained standard, but an automatic was optional. The car featured a considerably quieter exhaust system, and the suspension was much closer to stock, which greatly improved the ride and comfort. All told, 1,365 of these menacing powerhouses were provided in 1966.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1966-Mustang-Shelby-GT350/1966-Mustang-Shelby-GT350-18.jpg" alt="" width="4868" height="3246" /></p>
<p>The car offered here, chassis number SFM6S2372, was ordered on June 27, 1966, and three days later, it was shipped to well-known Ford performance dealer Jack Loftus Ford, of Hinsdale, Illinois. The GT350 was ordered in black with a rear seat but without the usual Le Mans stripes along the hood, roof, and rear deck, which was a rather unusual specification that, aside from the throaty engine note, made for quite a sleeper.</p>
<p>The original owner, J.W. Mart, of Amsterdam, Ohio, purchased the car on January 6, 1967, and performed minor maintenance and repairs to the radio, steering, and exhaust systems, which is noted in the SAAC Registry. The car was then sold to Robert Doxy, of Des Plaines, Illinois, for whom the carburetor was replaced by his local dealer at 12,000 miles, under a policy adjustment, in which Shelby American paid for the carburetor and the owner paid for the labor.</p>

<p>Later, in 1987, the GT350 passed to Russell Thompson, of Marion, Iowa, and then to Daniel Green and Kristin Thomas, of nearby Cedar Falls, who completed its restoration. It was authenticated for the present owners by Howard Pardee, of the Shelby American Automobile Club, who issued a Shelby Serial Number Verification, and by Craig Conley, who examined the car and noted the numerous numbers stamped in the proper areas of the vehicle, which confirm its authenticity. Specifically, the car retains its original Ford VIN on the passenger-side inner engine bay apron and its unique hand-stamped Shelby serial number on the passenger-side shock tower area, as well as its original and unique Shelby Mustang aluminum VIN tag. The same documentation lists the original parts that are still with the car, all of which are date-coded to the build date of this particular GT350. Copies of this information are on file, along with an original owner&#8217;s manual and other paperwork relating to the car&#8217;s ownership history, including original invoices from Shelby American to Loftus Ford.</p>

<p>The Ferrari Challenge Series was established in 1993, and it sought to introduce more Ferrari customers to racing by offering a single-marque racing series with Ferrari?s then-current production mid-engine V-8 sports car, the 348. Utilizing a platform that is currently in production as a road car allowed Ferrari to offer drivers a car that was vastly similar to one they might already have in their garage, giving them a chance to venture out onto the track in a vehicle that is already inherently familiar. From its outset, the Challenge series proved to be quite successful, and Ferrari dealerships saw an influx of customers looking to compete from all over the world.</p>
<p>As the fifth and current model campaigned in the Challenge series, the 458 is, by far, the most technologically advanced of the series. It retains the same power output of a standard street-legal 458, but the gear ratios and calibration of the dual-clutch gearbox were changed in order to provide greater low-end torque. Performance was also increased due to a focus on reducing weight wherever possible, which was done by utilizing many carbon-fiber components and fitting thinner body panels. Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes and an advanced ABS system developed on Ferrari?s 599XX were also fitted to improve braking and handling performance. Yet another feature that differentiates it from its road-legal sibling is the Ferrari?s F1-Trac, which is a highly advanced traction-control system that continuously monitors grip to distribute the maximum amount of performance given the current track conditions. For cars destined for the American market, the standard Lexan side windows were completely removed and replaced with safety nets. This experience is normally reserved for just the driver, but the 458 Challenge comes equipped with a removable passenger seat for an instructor, or a lucky passenger, to ride along.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/2013-Ferrari-458-Challenge-Evoluzione/2013-Ferrari-458-Challenge-Evoluzione-07.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2601" /></p>
<p>The Evoluzione, or ?Evo,? package for the 458 Challenge, new for the 2014 season, introduced a host of welcome updates to the 458 platform. While the Evo kit retains the same engine and transmission of the original car, Ferrari?s Corse Clienti department went to great lengths to improve the aerodynamics and available downforce on the car. As such, the Evo package adds a revised rear bumper, diffuser, and spoiler, as well as a revised front bumper and splitter, which have all been derived from the GT3-spec 458 race car. These improvements have made the car more drivable overall and have brought greater stability at high speeds. For the upcoming seasons of the Ferrari Challenge Series, all 458 Challenge cars must be fitted with the Evoluzione package to be eligible for competition. Current owners of the standard 458 Challenge can purchase the package in order to upgrade their existing car, while new owners can purchase a 458 Challenge with the Evoluzione kit already installed at the factory prior to delivery.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/2013-Ferrari-458-Challenge-Evoluzione/2013-Ferrari-458-Challenge-Evoluzione-19.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>This specific 2013 example, finished in Nero, was delivered to its first and current owner in the summer of 2013. It was used for just two half-day sessions with the Ferrari Club of America at Watkins Glen and two four-hour ?shake-down? sessions over the course of two days at Daytona International Speedway in January 2014. In early May 2014, the Evo kit was installed, making this 458 eligible for the upcoming Challenge seasons. Since its upgrade to Evoluzione specifications, this car has yet to be driven and is essentially in as-new condition. The car comes complete with all the requisite accessories to compete in future Challenge events and includes a set of magnesium wheels with racing slicks, as well as onboard cameras and computers, which are necessary to record race telemetry.</p>

<p>The Ferrari Challenge Series has proven to be quite popular amongst tifosi well into its 21st year, as it provides an excellent entry for a Ferrari owner to experience the thrills of a new Ferrari at speed on the race track. This nearly new 458 Challenge Evoluzione is ready for the remainder of the 2015/2016 season, and it would be an exhilarating vehicle for either the dedicated track-day enthusiast or an individual new to racing.</p>

<p>The Mercedes-Benz 500 K was introduced at the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, more commonly referred to as the Berlin Motor Show, in March 1934. Although it was produced alongside the 380 K, it was planned as a successor model to satiate the expressed interest of Mercedes-Benz?s wealthy clientele for a luxury conveyance that produced more power.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet-01.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1893" /></p>
<p>The 500 K succeeded to this end, with the 380 being phased out by the end of 1934. It embodied a generously braced chassis with fully independent suspension and, of course, an engine with an increased bore and stroke, which created 4,984 cubic centimeters of displacement. Its output was 100 horsepower in normal operation and an impressive 160 horsepower with the supercharger engaged. This power unit was mated to a four-speed gearbox, with direct ratio in third gear and the fourth gear acting as an overdrive unit. The result was a sensation, and ultimately, 342 clients, mainly from Europe, England, and North America, visited their local Mercedes-Benz dealers to place an order for the new car.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet-03.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2561" /></p>
<p>One of those clients was Adolf Busch, of Hamburg, Germany. He placed an order for the Cabriolet A, which was logged under kommission number 12847 and eventually assigned to chassis 105384. Connoisseurs of supercharged Mercedes-Benzes understand this early Cabriolet A body style to be one of the most desirable open examples, short of the Spezial Roadster, as it retains the best elements of its predecessor, the SSK, with its long sweeping fenders, louvers on the top and sides of the hood, a low windshield and top, dual rear-mounted spare tires, and a passenger compartment set far back. This particular example is unique, with its leather bonnet strap harkening back to the heroic days of the six-cylinder steeds that had been driven by Stuck, Caracciola, and von Brauchitsch.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet-08.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2235" /></p>
<p>Mr. Busch only had this car for a few years, as a notation on the kommission paper, a copy of which is on file, indicates that on October 31, 1938, the ownership of the car was reassigned to Dr. Gavin, who was reportedly a director at Mercedes-Benz. It is believed that the engine upgrade to 540 K specification, which is well-known in this example, was completed at this time. This upgrade not only added torque and increased horsepower to 180 with the blower engaged, but it also created a more potent combination when being mated to the lighter and more flexible 500 K chassis.</p>
<p>During the war, the car ended up in France, and in the late 1950s, it was purchased by Dean Weihe, a captain in the U.S. Air Force. Mr. Weihe imported the car into the United States in 1961 and began performing a cosmetic restoration, which was completed around 1964. Scans from two Florida-area newspapers at the time make mention of Weihe?s debut of the Mercedes at a local old car outing. In the article, he notes his importation of the car from France, where it had lain dormant for a number of years in a village outside of Paris. Mr. Weihe retained the car at his home in Florida for the better part of three decades, finally selling it in the late 1980s or early 1990s. At this time, it was purchased by another collector from Florida and traveled with him overseas.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet-14.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>The car was reported to be largely original, but in 1999, the purchaser commissioned restorer Francois Cointreau, of France, to perform a high-quality concours restoration. The body was removed from the chassis so that the skin could be removed, and all necessary repairs were made to the original wood framing to ensure the continued integrity of the car. Cointreau?s work focused on the cosmetic aspects of the restoration, and between 2000 and 2001, Riefen-Wagner, of Landshut, Germany, performed all of the mechanical overhaul work. This included a complete engine overhaul and a rebuilding of the brakes, chassis, suspension, steering, and fuel systems. It was also the recipient of a new radiator core, which provides significant peace of mind for those familiar with the exorbitant cost of overhauling the intricate radiators on these cars. Within the cars history file are photos of Cointreau?s work, as well as receipts from Riefen-Wagner.</p>
<p>Its current caretaker of nine years has continued to fastidiously maintain the impressive quality of the fit and finish of his 540 K as part of his select collection of pre-war classics. In 2009, its mettle was tested on the rigorous 1000-mile journey through the mountain roads of the Colorado Grand, and it performed flawlessly. The successful completion of this rally is a testament to the strength and versatility of this automobile, the quality of Riefen-Wagner?s work, and the subsequent maintenance it has enjoyed since.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://desert-motors.com/cpg/albums/tempphotos/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet/1935_Mercedes-Benz_500-540K_Cabriolet-31.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2560" /></p>
<p>Only 33 examples of the Mercedes-Benz 500 K Cabriolet A were constructed, and it is believed that only 11 remain, with a small number of those having their more potent 5.4-liter engine being mated to the lighter 500 K chassis, as 105384 does. The car has benefitted from an outstanding restoration and excellent care and maintenance, making it not only a mere piece of sculpture that would be an exceptional contender for entry into any of the most prestigious concours around the world but also a driving machine that is capable of long-distance touring in the spirit for which it was originally built.</p>
