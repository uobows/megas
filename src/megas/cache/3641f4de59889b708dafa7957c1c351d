We already have the fourth most expensive alcohol prices in Europe. How high would it need to go before it wasn?t being sold at ?pocket-money prices?? <P>While it is true that it is possible to buy some very cheap beers for less per litre than some very expensive brands of bottled water, as a generalised statement <a href="http://curmudgeoncolumns.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/june-2010.html">alcohol is cheaper than water</a> is not far short of an outright lie. In my local Tesco, I can buy two litres of fizzy water for 17p. I?d really like to know where I can get beer cheaper than that. It?s about as accurate and meaningful as saying you can buy cars cheaper than pedal cycles. <P>And the claim that supermarkets are routinely <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/loss-of-brain-leading.html">selling alcohol as a loss-leader</a> doesn?t stand up to analysis. I?m not saying it doesn?t ever happen, but it simply makes no economic sense to sell something that makes up a substantial proportion of a shopping basket at a loss. There may be very little margin in those discounted slabs of Carling, but they?re not selling them for less than they paid for them. <P>The SLTA?s support for MUP might be understandable, if self-serving, if they actually stood to gain from it. But it won?t give anyone a single extra penny to spend in pubs, and if the price of a can of Carling goes up from 60p to 90p it?s not exactly going to encourage anyone to spend £3.50 on a pint in the pub. Indeed, as Christopher Snowdon <a href="https://velvetgloveironfist.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/supermarket-alcohol-giffen-good.html">argues here</a>, it could even lead to people spending less in pubs if they need to reallocate a fixed budget for spending on alcohol. <P>Plus, much off-trade alcohol consumption is not readily transferable to pubs anyway. The pensioner enjoying a nightcap of whisky, the family sharing a bottle of wine with their Sunday lunch, or the group of friends cracking open a few cans with their back-garden barbecue aren?t going to suddenly rush down to the pub if it costs more. It?s simply a question of making the everyday pleasures of ordinary people on limited budgets that bit less affordable. <P>The SLTA?s stance comes across as a nihilistic dog-in-the-manger attitude, taking the view that they have suffered, so why shouldn?t other parts of the drinks trade be made to suffer too? It?s certainly true that the Scottish on-trade has been hit very hard in recent years by the smoking ban and the reduction of the drink-drive limit. But they mounted a pretty feeble opposition to both measures, so in a sense have only themselves to blame. Taking it out on others, though, will achieve no more than a pointless venting of rage. Surely all parts of the drinks trade should take a united stand against the neo-Prohibitionists rather than allowing them to play divide and rule and being treated as useful idiots. <P>It should also be remembered that the study by the University of Sheffield  used to support the policy actually concludes that the most ?beneficial? results would come from setting differential minimum prices for on- and off-trades, with that for pubs and bars more than twice as high. Any advantage gained from minimum pricing could turn out to be short-lived, as the spotlight turns to on-trade pricing. And, when the guns of the neo-Prohibitionists are retargeted on the on-trade, the SLTA are likely to find themselves with very little sympathy from a Scottish public who they have been keen to see charged much more for their modest pleasures. <P>As Winston Churchill famously said, ?An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.? And the SLTA are getting very pally with an extremely dangerous reptile. Their stance is one of contemptible hypocrisy and, given that they are vanishingly unlikely to derive any benefit from minimum pricing, utterly delusional. <P>";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.com/2018/03/och-aye-what-nice-crocodile.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Curmudgeon)";s:7:"summary";s:5489:"<P>The introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol in Scotland is now less than two months away.

All Trade Assoc in these countries support MUP. <a href="https://twitter.com/HospUlster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HospUlster</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/VFIpubs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VFIpubs</a> <a href="https://t.co/freH6sB7ZV">https://t.co/freH6sB7ZV</a></p>&mdash; The SLTA (@SLTAssociation) <a href="https://twitter.com/SLTAssociation/status/968248991812128770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> But, as I have explained in the past, all of these claims are, at best, highly exaggerated and misleading. <P>Selling alcohol at <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/brass-in-pocket.html">pocket-money prices</a> is a largely meaningless statement, and carries a somewhat offensive insinuation that it is routinely being sold to children. We already have the fourth most expensive alcohol prices in Europe. How high would it need to go before it wasn?t being sold at ?pocket-money prices?? <P>While it is true that it is possible to buy some very cheap beers for less per litre than some very expensive brands of bottled water, as a generalised statement <a href="http://curmudgeoncolumns.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/june-2010.html">alcohol is cheaper than water</a> is not far short of an outright lie. In my local Tesco, I can buy two litres of fizzy water for 17p. I?d really like to know where I can get beer cheaper than that. It?s about as accurate and meaningful as saying you can buy cars cheaper than pedal cycles. <P>And the claim that supermarkets are routinely <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/loss-of-brain-leading.html">selling alcohol as a loss-leader</a> doesn?t stand up to analysis. I?m not saying it doesn?t ever happen, but it simply makes no economic sense to sell something that makes up a substantial proportion of a shopping basket at a loss. There may be very little margin in those discounted slabs of Carling, but they?re not selling them for less than they paid for them. <P>The SLTA?s support for MUP might be understandable, if self-serving, if they actually stood to gain from it. But it won?t give anyone a single extra penny to spend in pubs, and if the price of a can of Carling goes up from 60p to 90p it?s not exactly going to encourage anyone to spend £3.50 on a pint in the pub. Indeed, as Christopher Snowdon <a href="https://velvetgloveironfist.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/supermarket-alcohol-giffen-good.html">argues here</a>, it could even lead to people spending less in pubs if they need to reallocate a fixed budget for spending on alcohol. <P>Plus, much off-trade alcohol consumption is not readily transferable to pubs anyway. The pensioner enjoying a nightcap of whisky, the family sharing a bottle of wine with their Sunday lunch, or the group of friends cracking open a few cans with their back-garden barbecue aren?t going to suddenly rush down to the pub if it costs more. It?s simply a question of making the everyday pleasures of ordinary people on limited budgets that bit less affordable. <P>The SLTA?s stance comes across as a nihilistic dog-in-the-manger attitude, taking the view that they have suffered, so why shouldn?t other parts of the drinks trade be made to suffer too? It?s certainly true that the Scottish on-trade has been hit very hard in recent years by the smoking ban and the reduction of the drink-drive limit. But they mounted a pretty feeble opposition to both measures, so in a sense have only themselves to blame. Taking it out on others, though, will achieve no more than a pointless venting of rage. Surely all parts of the drinks trade should take a united stand against the neo-Prohibitionists rather than allowing them to play divide and rule and being treated as useful idiots. <P>It should also be remembered that the study by the University of Sheffield  used to support the policy actually concludes that the most ?beneficial? results would come from setting differential minimum prices for on- and off-trades, with that for pubs and bars more than twice as high. Any advantage gained from minimum pricing could turn out to be short-lived, as the spotlight turns to on-trade pricing. And, when the guns of the neo-Prohibitionists are retargeted on the on-trade, the SLTA are likely to find themselves with very little sympathy from a Scottish public who they have been keen to see charged much more for their modest pleasures. <P>As Winston Churchill famously said, ?An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.? And the SLTA are getting very pally with an extremely dangerous reptile. Their stance is one of contemptible hypocrisy and, given that they are vanishingly unlikely to derive any benefit from minimum pricing, utterly delusional. <P>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1519995360;}i:4;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5623537812609722663.post-2257980595199173158";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:49:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:35:"Following in the footsteps of Morse";s:11:"description";s:9728:"<p>Why don?t we have a day out in Oxford, asked someone on the <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/beerandpubs/">Beer & Pubs Forum</a>.

The owner of a community pub in Brighton has criticised craft beer for <a href="https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2018/02/21/Craft-beer-pricing-out-poorer-consumers-claims-community-pub-owner">?pricing out? poorer consumers</a>, while Dave S of Brewing in a Bedsitter has mused on <a href="https://brewinabedsit.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/getting-what-you-pay-for.html">all the different factors</a> that make up the price of beer over the bar, and Boak &amp; Bailey have posed the question whether it is possible to get <a href="https://boakandbailey.com/2018/02/quick-post-one-practical-thing/">a decent pint of craft for £3</a>. <p>Most consumer markets have a premium segment where consumers are willing to pay more for what is, or is perceived to be, higher quality. But, in general, this is ?similar but better? rather than something completely different, and is done to some degree as an assertion of social or financial status. That is, at least partly, why people buy Audis rather than Skodas. This is something that brewers have always struggled to pull off ? while some beers are classified as ?premium?, it tends to be because they are stronger. There are some undeniably premium brands, such as Peroni and Guinness, but they?re not craft. Possibly Punk IPA is now breaking out the craft straitjacket to join them. <p>Craft, on the other hand, is something that is chosen as a means of expressing one?s individuality and discernment rather than status as such. If you?re out in a mixed group, and shun the Peroni or Punk on the bar in favour of that can of Gopherville murk skulking at the back of the fridge, frankly you?ll come across as a bit of an oddball. This doesn?t just apply to beer ? Boak &amp; Bailey have recently commented on <a href="http://boakandbailey.com/2017/06/not-just-beer-craftication-everything/">the craftification of everything</a>. The traditional market stratification is breaking down and people are seeing consumer choices as a means of self-definition. <p>Where a premium does exist in beer, is is much more between establishments than between brands. Wetherspoon?s is, across the board, markedly cheaper than Brunning &amp; Price or the Port Street Beer House, and this is reflected in the clientele they attract. The status-conscious pubgoer is much more likely to say they frequent gastropubs than that they drink Brand X. <p>Of course it?s a truism that, broadly speaking, there is a trade-off between price and quality. However, <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/does-dearer-mean-better.html">as I discussed here</a>, the actual cost of ingredients is a pretty small proportion of the price you pay over the bar, and with a small brewery you?re often paying more for less efficient production, distribution and administration too. The whole issue is clouded by the question of strength, as very often that shock £9 pint turns out to be 10.5%, and thus not directly comparable with a session beer. And the biggest factor affecting the price to the consumer is retail markup, not brewery gate price. It?s very easy to find pubs charging 33% more for the same product within a couple of miles of each other. <p>In pretty much every consumer market, there?s a range of products at a wide range of price points, and it?s accepted that the more expensive ones are going to be beyond the mean of consumers of modest incomes. Most people, though, do have a little to set aside for luxuries or self-indulgences, and if they choose to spend that on expensive malt whiskies, or theatre trips, or restoring a classic car, that?s up to them, and they do it in the full knowledge that they?re sacrificing something else, possibly that Sky TV subscription, to pursue it. But it?s not typical behaviour of their peer group. <p>If someone is interested in craft beer, and chooses to buy four craft cans for a tenner rather than a slab of Carling, there?s nothing to stop them.

For much of its lifetime, CAMRA was the only game in town when it came to ?beer enthusiasm? in the UK. However, more recently, this has been challenged by a new wave of brewers, often influenced by the American craft beer movement. They have introduced a much greater amount of innovation in beer, and often done it by presenting their products in the keg format not approved by CAMRA. This has met with widespread success, especially amongst younger drinkers. And, very often, the narrative, most notably that of BrewDog, has been one of kicking against the established real ale culture. <p>There has been a growing amount of interesting, high-quality beer being brewed entirely outside the orbit of CAMRA, and in the process making the organisation look old-fashioned and stick-in-the-mud. So surely it should be looking at widening its scope to encompass all good beer and beer enthusiasts, rather than sticking within a narrow, pedantically-defined box. And thus was born the impetus for the Revitalisation project. <p>Now, I am certainly no cask zealot who doesn?t think any other kind of beer is worth drinking. I?m entirely relaxed about drinking non-real beers, and do from time to time, although in general I tend to visit pubs where cask is well-kept so there?s no need to. CAMRA has often been ill-served by the narrow dogmatism that bleats on about ?chemical fizz? and ?sealed dustbins?. It has always been much too reluctant to recognise merit in beers that fall outside its remit. But that isn?t the same as ?promoting? or ?embracing? them. On the other hand, I fail to summon up much enthusiasm for the new wave of ?craft keg? beers, and to be honest my interest is more likely to be piqued by spotting obscure old brands of keg mild on the bar of trad pubs. <p>The basic underlying principle of CAMRA is that, for draught ales in the British tradition, cask-conditioning, when done properly, is the best way of presenting them. I?m entirely happy with that. But, in a sense, you don?t even need to sign up to that view to believe it?s a tradition worth holding on to. I have always seen CAMRA as essentially a preservationist organisation, stemming from the same wellspring of sentiment as steam railways and restoring historic buildings. It is about championing a unique aspect of British heritage ? cask beer, the breweries that produce it and the pubs and other licensed premises that sell it. What it isn?t is a modern movement supporting ?all good beer?, however defined, and to want to turn it into that would be for it to become something of a markedly different character. As one blog commenter very perceptively said:  <br /><blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><i>CAMRA is a people-powered cultural heritage organisation in all but name. Traditional drinking culture is what links real ale, real cider/perry, historic pub interiors and community pubs. Embrace it! By all means show craft more respect (the same respect shown to Belgian beers and quality German and Czech lagers, for instance), but don?t water down the central purpose of CAMRA.</i></span></blockquote>That doesn?t mean you need to be <i>against</i> other forms of beer, just as the steam enthusiast doesn?t refuse to travel on electric trains, or the champion of Victorian architecture doesn?t do his best to avoid modern buildings. But they?re not something you want to pursue as a leisure interest. As I?ve said in the past, <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/a-taste-of-tradition.html">you can?t expect everyone to be interested in everything</a>. <p>I?m not saying there?s anything wrong with wanting to be a modern, all-encompassing beer enthusiast, just that that?s not what CAMRA?s fundamentally about. And trying to fit both into the same big tent is likely to be fraught with problems and pull in different directions. <p>It?s not really as if modern keg beer needs campaigning for anyway ? it seems to be doing perfectly well for itself as a purely commercial product. What exactly would CAMRA bring to the party that is any different? And, while it?s sometimes said that real ale has been ?saved?, that?s a very complacent and blinkered viewpoint. The absolute amount of real ale sold now is far less than it was when CAMRA was formed. The only places where real ale can exist - pubs and clubs - continue to close at an alarming rate. And there are plenty of ?real ale deserts?, often in places where, thirty or forty years ago, many of the pubs sold real ale. So there?s still plenty of work to be done without diluting the message. Arguably the biggest threat to real ale?s future is complacency. <p>We haven?t had sight of the precise wording of the motions yet. But my feeling is that I will be strongly inclined to vote against the main thrust of the revitalisation project. If you care about the protection of our beer, brewing and pub heritage, I would urge you to do likewise. CAMRA, in my view, should draw in its horns a bit and stick to the knitting of its core principles. I?m a Life Member, and to resign would just be an exercise in cutting off my nose to spite my face. But, if the resolutions are passed, I will need to question whether it is still an organisation that deserves a substantial chunk of my leisure time. <p>The whole process has already proved divisive, with a lot of fur and insults flying on CAMRA?s Discourse forum. Nobody knows what the outcome is going to be, and I can?t see the likes of YouGov carrying out opinion polls of CAMRA members to give us any idea. But there must be a risk that what was put forward, with good intentions, with the aim of saving CAMRA, could end up killing it, or at least permanently diminishing its influence and credibility. For example, Ian Thurman on his thewickingman blog has questioned whether it might expose CAMRA to <a href="https://thewickingman.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/perfect-storm-approaching/">hostile media scrutiny</a> if it seems equivocal about its purpose. <p>It is a high-risk strategy on the part of CAMRA?s leadership. It?s not difficult to imagine the scenario where the Special Resolutions are passed by the necessary majority of the membership as a whole, but defeated in the hall by the physical attendees at the AGM, which would create a lot of bad blood.

For much of its lifetime, CAMRA was the only game in town when it came to ?beer enthusiasm? in the UK. However, more recently, this has been challenged by a new wave of brewers, often influenced by the American craft beer movement. They have introduced a much greater amount of innovation in beer, and often done it by presenting their products in the keg format not approved by CAMRA. This has met with widespread success, especially amongst younger drinkers. And, very often, the narrative, most notably that of BrewDog, has been one of kicking against the established real ale culture. <p>There has been a growing amount of interesting, high-quality beer being brewed entirely outside the orbit of CAMRA, and in the process making the organisation look old-fashioned and stick-in-the-mud. So surely it should be looking at widening its scope to encompass all good beer and beer enthusiasts, rather than sticking within a narrow, pedantically-defined box. And thus was born the impetus for the Revitalisation project. <p>Now, I am certainly no cask zealot who doesn?t think any other kind of beer is worth drinking. I?m entirely relaxed about drinking non-real beers, and do from time to time, although in general I tend to visit pubs where cask is well-kept so there?s no need to. CAMRA has often been ill-served by the narrow dogmatism that bleats on about ?chemical fizz? and ?sealed dustbins?. It has always been much too reluctant to recognise merit in beers that fall outside its remit. But that isn?t the same as ?promoting? or ?embracing? them. On the other hand, I fail to summon up much enthusiasm for the new wave of ?craft keg? beers, and to be honest my interest is more likely to be piqued by spotting obscure old brands of keg mild on the bar of trad pubs. <p>The basic underlying principle of CAMRA is that, for draught ales in the British tradition, cask-conditioning, when done properly, is the best way of presenting them. I?m entirely happy with that. But, in a sense, you don?t even need to sign up to that view to believe it?s a tradition worth holding on to. I have always seen CAMRA as essentially a preservationist organisation, stemming from the same wellspring of sentiment as steam railways and restoring historic buildings. It is about championing a unique aspect of British heritage ? cask beer, the breweries that produce it and the pubs and other licensed premises that sell it. What it isn?t is a modern movement supporting ?all good beer?, however defined, and to want to turn it into that would be for it to become something of a markedly different character. As one blog commenter very perceptively said:  <br /><blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><i>CAMRA is a people-powered cultural heritage organisation in all but name. Traditional drinking culture is what links real ale, real cider/perry, historic pub interiors and community pubs. Embrace it! By all means show craft more respect (the same respect shown to Belgian beers and quality German and Czech lagers, for instance), but don?t water down the central purpose of CAMRA.</i></span></blockquote>That doesn?t mean you need to be <i>against</i> other forms of beer, just as the steam enthusiast doesn?t refuse to travel on electric trains, or the champion of Victorian architecture doesn?t do his best to avoid modern buildings. But they?re not something you want to pursue as a leisure interest. As I?ve said in the past, <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/a-taste-of-tradition.html">you can?t expect everyone to be interested in everything</a>. <p>I?m not saying there?s anything wrong with wanting to be a modern, all-encompassing beer enthusiast, just that that?s not what CAMRA?s fundamentally about. And trying to fit both into the same big tent is likely to be fraught with problems and pull in different directions. <p>It?s not really as if modern keg beer needs campaigning for anyway ? it seems to be doing perfectly well for itself as a purely commercial product. What exactly would CAMRA bring to the party that is any different? And, while it?s sometimes said that real ale has been ?saved?, that?s a very complacent and blinkered viewpoint. The absolute amount of real ale sold now is far less than it was when CAMRA was formed. The only places where real ale can exist - pubs and clubs - continue to close at an alarming rate. And there are plenty of ?real ale deserts?, often in places where, thirty or forty years ago, many of the pubs sold real ale. So there?s still plenty of work to be done without diluting the message. Arguably the biggest threat to real ale?s future is complacency. <p>We haven?t had sight of the precise wording of the motions yet. But my feeling is that I will be strongly inclined to vote against the main thrust of the revitalisation project. If you care about the protection of our beer, brewing and pub heritage, I would urge you to do likewise. CAMRA, in my view, should draw in its horns a bit and stick to the knitting of its core principles. I?m a Life Member, and to resign would just be an exercise in cutting off my nose to spite my face. But, if the resolutions are passed, I will need to question whether it is still an organisation that deserves a substantial chunk of my leisure time. <p>The whole process has already proved divisive, with a lot of fur and insults flying on CAMRA?s Discourse forum. Nobody knows what the outcome is going to be, and I can?t see the likes of YouGov carrying out opinion polls of CAMRA members to give us any idea. But there must be a risk that what was put forward, with good intentions, with the aim of saving CAMRA, could end up killing it, or at least permanently diminishing its influence and credibility. For example, Ian Thurman on his thewickingman blog has questioned whether it might expose CAMRA to <a href="https://thewickingman.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/perfect-storm-approaching/">hostile media scrutiny</a> if it seems equivocal about its purpose. <p>It is a high-risk strategy on the part of CAMRA?s leadership. It?s not difficult to imagine the scenario where the Special Resolutions are passed by the necessary majority of the membership as a whole, but defeated in the hall by the physical attendees at the AGM, which would create a lot of bad blood. And, given that normal policy motions are simply approved by a straight majority of AGM attendees, it?s possible that ?traditionalists? may seek to chip away at the revitalisation changes through future AGM motions. It could lead to more explicit ?culture wars? in beer. <p>If the resolutions fail to win the necessary majority, or are even defeated outright, then there will a lot of egg on faces and serious soul-searching to be done. Will it be a case of ?one more heave?, or trying to sneak changes in through the back door, or will there need to a fundamental shift to a more back-to-basics approach? <p> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>(The graphic, which seemed highly appropriate, was borrowed from Kirst Walker?s <a href="https://ladysinksthebooze.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/a-tiny-camra-rebellion-in-23-pages/">Lady Sinks the Booze</a> blog.)</i></span><p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1518165600;}i:8;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5623537812609722663.post-7022139358913012542";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 13:19:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:22:"Swings and roundabouts";s:11:"description";s:1045:"<p>The British Beer & Pub Association have published their latest <a href="http://www.beerandpub.com/news/beer-sales-rise-at-the-end-of-2017-chancellor-s-duty-freeze-a-timely-boost-to-sales-says-bbpa">Quarterly Beer Barometer</a> statistics, bringing the series up to the end of 2017.

To draw a Manichean distinction between real=good and non-real=bad is silly and ignorant. And, for many of them, especially the stronger ones, the ?East Sheen Tennis Club? argument applies, that they allow beers to be sold on draught that would not be viable in cask because of their niche appeal. But, broadly speaking, they would still be improved if they could be sold in well-kept cask form. And to suggest otherwise is to question what has been the point of CAMRA?s efforts over the past 45 years. Maybe we should go back to 1977 and happily drink that top-pressure London Pride. <p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1517488260;}i:11;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5623537812609722663.post-1426726741993903112";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 12:35:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:33:"The best is the enemy of the good";s:11:"description";s:3797:"<p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KEtOX0bb0yo/Wm4-ftIkEAI/AAAAAAAAGJQ/PeaL1Olpt_UxAaB5NoOwEdMG73KMVC2DgCLcBGAs/s1600/cask%2Bbreather.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KEtOX0bb0yo/Wm4-ftIkEAI/AAAAAAAAGJQ/PeaL1Olpt_UxAaB5NoOwEdMG73KMVC2DgCLcBGAs/s1600/cask%2Bbreather.jpg" data-original-width="247" data-original-height="204" /></a></div>The cask breather has for long been a bone of contention within CAMRA.

Some of the objections seem spurious, such as arguing that the flavour actually benefits from exposure to the atmosphere after the cask has been tapped. It all seems to boil down to a generalised dislike of CO2 in any form, and a suspicion that sanctioning the use of breathers will represent the thin end of the wedge. <p>A cask breather should only really be necessary for pubs without sufficient trade to empty a cask within three days. Clearly, beer stored under a breather will be much preferable to either no beer at all, keg beer, or rancid cask beer. In ideal conditions, there should be no need for it if the pub can shift its beer quickly enough, but in the real world that is often not the case. The objection is a case of the best being the enemy of the good. <p>One concern, though, is that if CAMRA gave the green light to cask breathers, some pubs might take it as an encouragement to use them to further increase an already over-extended beer range. If a cask will last seven days rather than three, then you can have twice as many different beers on. However, while a seven-day-old cask under a breather will be far better than one exposed to the atmosphere, it?s still going to have a touch of staleness about it, and not be a patch on one that?s just been tapped.

If anything, I?d say that?s a surprisingly low figure, as it?s a subject that is potentially far more of a minefield than <a href="https://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/nobody-else-has-complained.html">returning unsatisfactory beer to the bar</a>. <p>Looking at the figures in more detail, the first two reasons, of getting the wrong meal and the food being undercooked, are fairly clear-cut, and you should have a strong case. Indeed you have to wonder who the 8% of people are who wouldn?t send the wrong meal back. But, after that, it becomes more problematical. The range of potential faults in food is much greater than that in beer, and very often it becomes a matter of subjective judgment. <p>I freely admit to being a distinctly fussy and eccentric eater, but in general I simply try to avoid ordering dishes where there may be an issue, as I wouldn?t feel at all comfortable about returning a meal just because it wasn?t cooked to my liking. How fatty or gristly would a steak need to be before you deemed it unacceptable? And what would be your expectations of getting a better one? There have also been several occasions where a dish, while maybe not objectionable in its own right, turned out to be something very different from what the menu had led me to believe. <p>Plus there is the question of what happens to a meal if you send it back. With beer, it?s simply a case of replacing it with another one, but if your food is undercooked, are they going to cook it a bit more, and if they did would that overall be a satisfactory cooking process anyway? Or are they going to start again from scratch, which will cost them money, and cost you time? That may not be a good solution if you have something else to do later.  <p>If a pub can?t provide you with an acceptable replacement beer, then it?s not really a major problem if you have to forgo a drink. But if there?s nowhere else suitable to eat nearby then you may be forced to go hungry, hence why people may often decide that struggling through unappetising food is the less bad option. And there?s always the suspicion that the kitchen staff may feel affronted by seeing their carefully-prepared dish sent back and end up spitting in it ? or worse. The whole business of returning food is always likely to leave a sour taste in the mouth. <p>Looking back, I can think of a few occasions where I?ve returned dishes because they were grossly undercooked, although with at least one of those it seemed to be taken with ill grace. And there was the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/ploughbaby-and-ploughmoron.html">notorious ploughman?s incident</a> in Tewkesbury. ?This is ham, I asked for cheese.? Then, when it came back, ?Er, isn?t a ploughman?s meant to include bread??

If anything, I?d say that?s a surprisingly low figure, as it?s a subject that is potentially far more of a minefield than <a href="https://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/nobody-else-has-complained.html">returning unsatisfactory beer to the bar</a>. <p>Looking at the figures in more detail, the first two reasons, of getting the wrong meal and the food being undercooked, are fairly clear-cut, and you should have a strong case. Indeed you have to wonder who the 8% of people are who wouldn?t send the wrong meal back. But, after that, it becomes more problematical. The range of potential faults in food is much greater than that in beer, and very often it becomes a matter of subjective judgment. <p>I freely admit to being a distinctly fussy and eccentric eater, but in general I simply try to avoid ordering dishes where there may be an issue, as I wouldn?t feel at all comfortable about returning a meal just because it wasn?t cooked to my liking. How fatty or gristly would a steak need to be before you deemed it unacceptable? And what would be your expectations of getting a better one? There have also been several occasions where a dish, while maybe not objectionable in its own right, turned out to be something very different from what the menu had led me to believe. <p>Plus there is the question of what happens to a meal if you send it back. With beer, it?s simply a case of replacing it with another one, but if your food is undercooked, are they going to cook it a bit more, and if they did would that overall be a satisfactory cooking process anyway? Or are they going to start again from scratch, which will cost them money, and cost you time? That may not be a good solution if you have something else to do later.  <p>If a pub can?t provide you with an acceptable replacement beer, then it?s not really a major problem if you have to forgo a drink. But if there?s nowhere else suitable to eat nearby then you may be forced to go hungry, hence why people may often decide that struggling through unappetising food is the less bad option. And there?s always the suspicion that the kitchen staff may feel affronted by seeing their carefully-prepared dish sent back and end up spitting in it ? or worse. The whole business of returning food is always likely to leave a sour taste in the mouth. <p>Looking back, I can think of a few occasions where I?ve returned dishes because they were grossly undercooked, although with at least one of those it seemed to be taken with ill grace. And there was the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/ploughbaby-and-ploughmoron.html">notorious ploughman?s incident</a> in Tewkesbury. ?This is ham, I asked for cheese.? Then, when it came back, ?Er, isn?t a ploughman?s meant to include bread?? There were also a few others which, with hindsight, I really should have sent back.  <p>So it?s hardly surprising that, overall, many diners tend to stick to dishes where the scope for making a mess of them is limited. And it has to be said that independently-run pubs, while they can serve up some excellent food, also seem to have a knack for putting their own spin on dishes and coming up with some <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/lost-in-translation.html">truly bizarre and unappealing interpretations</a>.

It can?t denied that it?s in need of a shot in the arm, with a high proportion of vacant shop units, many of those that are trading occupied by rather downmarket, low-rent businesses, and a general air of neglect and tattiness hanging over the whole place. As one of the commenters says, ?The town centre is somewhere that people from Stockport's wealthier suburbs shun on an increasing basis.? <p>We?ve been here before, of course, and I wrote on the same subject <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/take-me-to-pilot.html">back in 2012</a>. Stockport was nominated as a ?Portas pilot? town, but Mary?s magic touch doesn?t seem to have made much difference. (Did it anywhere?) Obviously if there was any kind of instant formula, plenty of towns around the country would already have seized upon it, but it?s a complex and challenging issue. I claim no professional expertise on the subject, but I thought it would be worth offering some musings. <p>With the rise of out-of-town retail parks and internet shopping, a large chunk of the business once enjoyed by traditional town centres has disappeared, and realistically it?s never coming back. If you want a specific, high-value item, it?s far easier to buy it from somewhere you can easily collect it, or have it delivered to your door. But that doesn?t mean that people end up sitting in isolation in their own homes, and town centres need to concentrate on areas where they can make a difference, either in giving a personal touch or where impulse buying and actually handling goods are important. That means sectors like fashion and jewellery, hands-on services like opticians and hairdressers, eating and drinking, and entertainment. <p>The role of local councils in urban regeneration can often be overstated. They can create the conditions for it to happen, but the bureaucratic and entrepreneurial mindsets are ultimately poles apart. In particular, they can?t dictate what kind of businesses they want to open. What councils can easily do, though, is make town centres less attractive places to visit and do business. A few years ago, I <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/failure-breeds-failure.html">made a post</a> in which I included a long list of ways in which one particular council had made their shopping centre less attractive, and were then surprised when people stopped using it. Depressingly, some loon in the comments thought that many of these were actually good ideas. <p>The most significant area in which councils can make a difference is that perennial bugbear, parking. All too often they have regarded it as a cash cow without any regard to its contribution to the wider economy of the town centre. Clearly it isn?t possible in a major town centre to provide unlimited free parking, but if it is to compete with locations like the Trafford Centre, it is important that it is both convenient and reasonably-priced.  <p>There isn?t really an absolute shortage of parking in central Stockport, but there are several ways in which it could be improved. The longer-stay car parks should be converted to pay-on-exit, so people don?t have to guess how long they?re going to be there, and there is no longer any risk of incurring a fine for overstaying. And it?s hardly user-friendly in this day and age that parking machines don?t give change, and don?t accept notes or cards. There should be a limited amount of short-stay free parking as close to the centre as possible, and all parking should be free after 6 pm. It would also be desirable to provide more commuter parking on the fringes of the town centre at say £4 a day to encourage employment.  <p>It?s all very well to preach that people should be using the bus, but in reality it has to accepted that decent parking is key to attracting more visitors, especially the more affluent who are going to spend more. The fact that the council offered free parking on Sundays and after 3 pm in their own car parks in the run-up to Christmas shows that they are well aware it is a disincentive. <p>Another area where council policies have an effect is the provision of public toilets. This is not a statutory obligation, and many councils, including Stockport, have taken advantage of this to literally slash the number they provide. But, without toilets, people may feel the need to curtail their visit, or take their business elsewhere to out-of-town supermarkets where facilities are available. There are some decent toilets in Merseyway, albeit provided by the shopping centre operators, not the council, but the town centre would also benefit from a high-quality set on or close to the Market Place. <p>This raises another issue, that of connectivity. The town centre is on two levels, connected by a variety of steep banks and steps. Even if you don?t find them physically challenging, they form a psychological barrier. You could easily spend all your time in and around Merseyway and Princes Street and never realise that the Market Place and St Petersgate even existed. Likewise, the station is a fair distance from the heart of the town, and at a much higher level. It?s not immediately obvious when arriving by train that there even is a town centre, let alone how to get to it. Possibly the two could be linked better by installing an all-weather travelator between the station approach and the bus station, and another connecting Warren Street and the Market Place. <p>The council also has a role in maintaining the quality of the environment ? clearing litter, providing adequate bins, fixing broken paving, removing growths of weeds. Small things can have a big effect on visitors. A place that looks cared for comes across as more welcoming. And the collection of tacky ?Christmas market? stalls that adorned the Merseyway precinct over the festive season didn?t exactly give an upmarket impression. <p>The area around the Market Place and the Underbanks represents what must be the best-preserved historic townscape in the whole of Greater Manchester and, although of limited extent, in quality it stands comparison with many of the well-known architectural show towns. The bridge carrying St Petersgate over Little Underbank is a particularly unusual and distinctive feature. This has potential as a tourist destination which surely could be exploited more than it is at present. Putting informative signboards up pointing out noteworthy features would be a start. As more visitors were attracted, the footfall would generate the demand to open up businesses in some of the currently vacant units, thus creating a virtuous circle. There are areas within Greater Manchester that manage to support a variety of independent, upmarket businesses, and if Ramsbottom can do it, surely this part of Stockport can too.  <p>To their credit, the council have produced a pub trail of the town centre in conjunction with the local CAMRA branch, and the town?s appeal as a venue for pub and beer tourism should be shouted more loudly, particularly with the opening of the Robinson?s Brewery Visitor Centre. The council should also be very careful to avoid the loss of any more of the town?s historic buildings, such as when the future of the Midland pub on Wellington Road North was threatened by a few inches of cycle lane as part of a new road scheme. Fortunately, after public protest, it was saved. <p>As outlined in the post I linked to above, employment is a key factor in ensuring the vitality of town centres. Workers will provide business to coffee and sandwich shops, buy gifts, cards and top-up shopping and patronise pubs and restaurants after work. They provide additional footfall and in a sense are a captive audience for retailers. Plus, if they like what they see, they may return at other times for more serious shopping trips. This is why the encouragement of employment, and providing the necessary facilities, is an important element in the mix. A town centre should not be solely seen as a retail destination. <p>On the other hand, while it?s sometimes claimed that increasing the amount of housing in or near town centres is a good way of reviving them, in fact, <a href="http://curmudgeoncolumns.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/december-2013.html">as I argued here</a>, that only has a very limited effect and can indeed be an admission of defeat.   <br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><i>While there may be ten thousand people living in Manchester City Centre now, when thirty years ago there were only a few hundred, that is still only the population that would support the handful of pubs in a typical small market town, and in terms of the centre?s overall pub trade is a drop in the ocean. Pubs thrive in the centre of Manchester, and other large cities, because they function as retail, employment, business, cultural and entertainment hubs for a wide surrounding area and thus attract large numbers of people for a wide variety of reasons.</i></span></span></blockquote>It?s their attractiveness as a hub that makes town centres thrive, not people living close by. And, in general, people, especially those with families, much prefer to live in leafy suburbs than cramped town-centre flats. <p>Just as small changes can easily set off a cycle of decline, it?s possible that things can go the other way. I?ve expressed a certain amount of scepticism about the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/red-elephant.html">Redrock development</a>, in being unsightly and poorly integrated with the rest of the town centre.

It can?t denied that it?s in need of a shot in the arm, with a high proportion of vacant shop units, many of those that are trading occupied by rather downmarket, low-rent businesses, and a general air of neglect and tattiness hanging over the whole place. As one of the commenters says, ?The town centre is somewhere that people from Stockport's wealthier suburbs shun on an increasing basis.? <p>We?ve been here before, of course, and I wrote on the same subject <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/take-me-to-pilot.html">back in 2012</a>. Stockport was nominated as a ?Portas pilot? town, but Mary?s magic touch doesn?t seem to have made much difference. (Did it anywhere?) Obviously if there was any kind of instant formula, plenty of towns around the country would already have seized upon it, but it?s a complex and challenging issue. I claim no professional expertise on the subject, but I thought it would be worth offering some musings. <p>With the rise of out-of-town retail parks and internet shopping, a large chunk of the business once enjoyed by traditional town centres has disappeared, and realistically it?s never coming back. If you want a specific, high-value item, it?s far easier to buy it from somewhere you can easily collect it, or have it delivered to your door. But that doesn?t mean that people end up sitting in isolation in their own homes, and town centres need to concentrate on areas where they can make a difference, either in giving a personal touch or where impulse buying and actually handling goods are important. That means sectors like fashion and jewellery, hands-on services like opticians and hairdressers, eating and drinking, and entertainment. <p>The role of local councils in urban regeneration can often be overstated. They can create the conditions for it to happen, but the bureaucratic and entrepreneurial mindsets are ultimately poles apart. In particular, they can?t dictate what kind of businesses they want to open. What councils can easily do, though, is make town centres less attractive places to visit and do business. A few years ago, I <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/failure-breeds-failure.html">made a post</a> in which I included a long list of ways in which one particular council had made their shopping centre less attractive, and were then surprised when people stopped using it. Depressingly, some loon in the comments thought that many of these were actually good ideas. <p>The most significant area in which councils can make a difference is that perennial bugbear, parking. All too often they have regarded it as a cash cow without any regard to its contribution to the wider economy of the town centre. Clearly it isn?t possible in a major town centre to provide unlimited free parking, but if it is to compete with locations like the Trafford Centre, it is important that it is both convenient and reasonably-priced.  <p>There isn?t really an absolute shortage of parking in central Stockport, but there are several ways in which it could be improved. The longer-stay car parks should be converted to pay-on-exit, so people don?t have to guess how long they?re going to be there, and there is no longer any risk of incurring a fine for overstaying. And it?s hardly user-friendly in this day and age that parking machines don?t give change, and don?t accept notes or cards. There should be a limited amount of short-stay free parking as close to the centre as possible, and all parking should be free after 6 pm. It would also be desirable to provide more commuter parking on the fringes of the town centre at say £4 a day to encourage employment.  <p>It?s all very well to preach that people should be using the bus, but in reality it has to accepted that decent parking is key to attracting more visitors, especially the more affluent who are going to spend more. The fact that the council offered free parking on Sundays and after 3 pm in their own car parks in the run-up to Christmas shows that they are well aware it is a disincentive. <p>Another area where council policies have an effect is the provision of public toilets. This is not a statutory obligation, and many councils, including Stockport, have taken advantage of this to literally slash the number they provide. But, without toilets, people may feel the need to curtail their visit, or take their business elsewhere to out-of-town supermarkets where facilities are available. There are some decent toilets in Merseyway, albeit provided by the shopping centre operators, not the council, but the town centre would also benefit from a high-quality set on or close to the Market Place. <p>This raises another issue, that of connectivity. The town centre is on two levels, connected by a variety of steep banks and steps. Even if you don?t find them physically challenging, they form a psychological barrier. You could easily spend all your time in and around Merseyway and Princes Street and never realise that the Market Place and St Petersgate even existed. Likewise, the station is a fair distance from the heart of the town, and at a much higher level. It?s not immediately obvious when arriving by train that there even is a town centre, let alone how to get to it. Possibly the two could be linked better by installing an all-weather travelator between the station approach and the bus station, and another connecting Warren Street and the Market Place. <p>The council also has a role in maintaining the quality of the environment ? clearing litter, providing adequate bins, fixing broken paving, removing growths of weeds. Small things can have a big effect on visitors. A place that looks cared for comes across as more welcoming. And the collection of tacky ?Christmas market? stalls that adorned the Merseyway precinct over the festive season didn?t exactly give an upmarket impression. <p>The area around the Market Place and the Underbanks represents what must be the best-preserved historic townscape in the whole of Greater Manchester and, although of limited extent, in quality it stands comparison with many of the well-known architectural show towns. The bridge carrying St Petersgate over Little Underbank is a particularly unusual and distinctive feature. This has potential as a tourist destination which surely could be exploited more than it is at present. Putting informative signboards up pointing out noteworthy features would be a start. As more visitors were attracted, the footfall would generate the demand to open up businesses in some of the currently vacant units, thus creating a virtuous circle. There are areas within Greater Manchester that manage to support a variety of independent, upmarket businesses, and if Ramsbottom can do it, surely this part of Stockport can too.  <p>To their credit, the council have produced a pub trail of the town centre in conjunction with the local CAMRA branch, and the town?s appeal as a venue for pub and beer tourism should be shouted more loudly, particularly with the opening of the Robinson?s Brewery Visitor Centre. The council should also be very careful to avoid the loss of any more of the town?s historic buildings, such as when the future of the Midland pub on Wellington Road North was threatened by a few inches of cycle lane as part of a new road scheme. Fortunately, after public protest, it was saved. <p>As outlined in the post I linked to above, employment is a key factor in ensuring the vitality of town centres. Workers will provide business to coffee and sandwich shops, buy gifts, cards and top-up shopping and patronise pubs and restaurants after work. They provide additional footfall and in a sense are a captive audience for retailers. Plus, if they like what they see, they may return at other times for more serious shopping trips. This is why the encouragement of employment, and providing the necessary facilities, is an important element in the mix. A town centre should not be solely seen as a retail destination. <p>On the other hand, while it?s sometimes claimed that increasing the amount of housing in or near town centres is a good way of reviving them, in fact, <a href="http://curmudgeoncolumns.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/december-2013.html">as I argued here</a>, that only has a very limited effect and can indeed be an admission of defeat.   <br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><i>While there may be ten thousand people living in Manchester City Centre now, when thirty years ago there were only a few hundred, that is still only the population that would support the handful of pubs in a typical small market town, and in terms of the centre?s overall pub trade is a drop in the ocean. Pubs thrive in the centre of Manchester, and other large cities, because they function as retail, employment, business, cultural and entertainment hubs for a wide surrounding area and thus attract large numbers of people for a wide variety of reasons.</i></span></span></blockquote>It?s their attractiveness as a hub that makes town centres thrive, not people living close by. And, in general, people, especially those with families, much prefer to live in leafy suburbs than cramped town-centre flats. <p>Just as small changes can easily set off a cycle of decline, it?s possible that things can go the other way. I?ve expressed a certain amount of scepticism about the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/red-elephant.html">Redrock development</a>, in being unsightly and poorly integrated with the rest of the town centre. But one thing it does bring is aspirational eating places, something that previously was singularly lacking. Some may sneer at ?chain restaurants?, but it was noticeable on a bright day between Christmas and New Year that Pizza Express was pretty full of fairly young and affluent people who previously might not have found anywhere to eat to their liking.

One of the biggest changes has been all-day opening, which was introduced in 1988 but took some time to become widespread. In principle, you can?t really argue against this, but it?s undeniable that it has transformed the drinking landscape. Before then, there was a clear division between drinking and non-drinking time, and the afternoon break defined the rhythm of the pub day. Very often, the approach of closing time at 2.30 or 3 concentrated the mind on getting that final pint in. <p>Nowadays, opening all day has become general in town and city centres, but many pubs in locations where there is less footfall have instead responded by ceasing to open at all at lunchtimes during the week. Oddly, this seems more common in the North than the South, where many pubs still keep to the traditional afternoon closure. But one phenomenon it has led to is a busy period of drinking in the afternoon, from 3 or 4 pm, onwards, something often noticed by Martin Taylor on his GBG-ticking travels. This is associated with the common knocking-off time of self-employed tradespeople. Many pubs are now opening their doors at exactly the time in the afternoon when they were once closing them. <p>The session where the effects of all-day opening have been most acutely felt is Sunday lunchtime. When it was restricted to a couple of hours, it was often one of the busiest and most convivial of the week, a time when people could relax and let their hair down before going home for a good lunch and a snooze. But, with the extension to 3 pm and then to all day, this unique, concentrated period has been progressively eroded and now, except in dining pubs, it is often completely dead. The introduction of Sunday trading in shops from the early 90s onwards has also been a factor here. I've written in the past about <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/sunday-lunchtime-through-years.html">the changing face of Sunday lunchtime drinking</a> in my local pub. <p>Sunday has also become the biggest day of the week for televised football, which inevitably changes the dynamics of pubs. As you will have gathered from reading this blog over the years, I?m not the greatest fan of football in pubs, but given that Sky Sports exists they can?t really afford to ignore it. But it has to be recognised that, when the big match is on, all other activities in pubs go out of the window, in particular just popping in for a quiet drink and a chat. <p>Another major change in pubs has been the ever-growing presence of food. Despite what some claim, there was no shortage of pub food in the 1970s, and in fact I?d suggest that, in absolute terms, there may well have been more food sold on weekday lunchtimes then than there is now. But it has steadily encroached into the evenings and weekends, and more and more pubs now present themselves as essentially eating houses where few go just for a drink, and would feel out of place if they did. Of course to a large extent this is a response to changing market conditions, and pubs can?t really be criticised for embracing food, but it has dramatically changed them. <p>In the past, there used to be plenty of pubs that had a mix of drinking and dining customers, which led to a wide-ranging customer base and could product a good atmosphere. But, as pubs have gone one way or the other, that kind of multi-purpose pub, while it can still be found, is becoming ever rarer. And a noticeable difference is that diners in pubs are much less likely to talk to other groups than drinkers. This is exacerbated by the redesign of interiors to replace wall benches, which face into the centre of the room and promote sociability, with individual tables surrounded by loose chairs, where customers only focus on the other members of their own group.  <p>In a wider context, it is noticeable that a lot fewer people now just go to the pub for a drink, as opposed to going out drinking. A good pub can provide a valuable ?third space? where people can engage with each other more freely and intimately than they can at home or in the workplace. It used to be commonplace to see various groups ? friends, workmates, couples, family members ? just enjoying a pint or two, but it?s now seen much less often. While this was perhaps a particular feature of the lunchtime session, it applies in the evenings too ? I?ve remarked before how at one time it was common for established married couples to just go to the pub for a drink as a change of scene, but it?s much less so now. The best conversations I ever had with my father were in the pub over a pint, but how many fathers and sons do you now see there? Martin Taylor has remarked on his travels how you still see this kind of thing in city centres, particularly with reference to Sheffield, but in other areas it?s increasingly rare. And the ?smart? pub, where better-off citizens would gather over a drink to discuss their BMWs, investments and foreign holidays, is pretty much entirely dead. The solid middle classes may eat in pubs, but they don?t drink in them much any more. <p>Now, you may say that this is just an exercise in nostalgia. Of course pubs, like everything, change over time, and perhaps I?m just lamenting that things are no longer the same as they were in the years when my view of the world was formed. And that?s really the point ? to reflect on just how the dynamics of pubs have changed. I?ve enjoyed many late afternoon sessions myself, which I could never do before 1988, and the tradespeople gathering in pubs at that kind of time are finding fulfilment in pubs in a way that was once impossible. Readers will no doubt point out examples where the old-fashioned conviviality still prevails. In my experience, very often it?s in the Sam Smith?s estate that pubs still work like they used to do. But it can?t be denied that, overall, the drinking trade in pubs is much thinner and less rich and varied than it once was ? the statistics on closures and the collapse of beer sales speak for themselves. <p>";s:4:"link";s:72:"http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.com/2017/12/that-was-then-this-is-now.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Curmudgeon)";s:7:"summary";s:6188:"<p>Over the past forty years, there have been dramatic and very noticeable shifts in the way pubs actually function, and in the ebb and flow of customers through the day.

Of course to a large extent this is a response to changing market conditions, and pubs can?t really be criticised for embracing food, but it has dramatically changed them. <p>In the past, there used to be plenty of pubs that had a mix of drinking and dining customers, which led to a wide-ranging customer base and could product a good atmosphere. But, as pubs have gone one way or the other, that kind of multi-purpose pub, while it can still be found, is becoming ever rarer. And a noticeable difference is that diners in pubs are much less likely to talk to other groups than drinkers. This is exacerbated by the redesign of interiors to replace wall benches, which face into the centre of the room and promote sociability, with individual tables surrounded by loose chairs, where customers only focus on the other members of their own group.  <p>In a wider context, it is noticeable that a lot fewer people now just go to the pub for a drink, as opposed to going out drinking. A good pub can provide a valuable ?third space? where people can engage with each other more freely and intimately than they can at home or in the workplace. It used to be commonplace to see various groups ? friends, workmates, couples, family members ? just enjoying a pint or two, but it?s now seen much less often. While this was perhaps a particular feature of the lunchtime session, it applies in the evenings too ? I?ve remarked before how at one time it was common for established married couples to just go to the pub for a drink as a change of scene, but it?s much less so now. The best conversations I ever had with my father were in the pub over a pint, but how many fathers and sons do you now see there? Martin Taylor has remarked on his travels how you still see this kind of thing in city centres, particularly with reference to Sheffield, but in other areas it?s increasingly rare. And the ?smart? pub, where better-off citizens would gather over a drink to discuss their BMWs, investments and foreign holidays, is pretty much entirely dead. The solid middle classes may eat in pubs, but they don?t drink in them much any more. <p>Now, you may say that this is just an exercise in nostalgia. Of course pubs, like everything, change over time, and perhaps I?m just lamenting that things are no longer the same as they were in the years when my view of the world was formed. And that?s really the point ? to reflect on just how the dynamics of pubs have changed. I?ve enjoyed many late afternoon sessions myself, which I could never do before 1988, and the tradespeople gathering in pubs at that kind of time are finding fulfilment in pubs in a way that was once impossible. Readers will no doubt point out examples where the old-fashioned conviviality still prevails. In my experience, very often it?s in the Sam Smith?s estate that pubs still work like they used to do. But it can?t be denied that, overall, the drinking trade in pubs is much thinner and less rich and varied than it once was ? the statistics on closures and the collapse of beer sales speak for themselves. <p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1514276520;}i:20;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5623537812609722663.post-9201796972235079463";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 08:01:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:18:"Not so dirty dozen";s:11:"description";s:3675:"<p>Following my <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/highlights-of-2017.html">general review of 2017</a>, here?s a selection of my most significant posts from throughout the year.

Last year?s is <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/highlights-of-2016.html">here</a>. It can?t really be called ?Golden Pints? as it?s really much more about pubs, pussycats, people and policies. During 2017 I have visited 183 different pubs, of which 95 were new to me, compared with 154 and 64 in 2016. In the remaining days of the year I?ll be adding a few to the total, most notably on the legendary <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/staggering-uphill.html">Hillgate Stagger</a> this coming Friday, but I don?t think I?ll be going to any more pubs that I haven?t already visited. <p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBCyn2m91gU/WjYkNsAd4YI/AAAAAAAAGEs/o_jxRdOIzJ8pcCGvwe89CKCSJcTzFglvwCLcBGAs/s1600/holly-bush-makeney.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBCyn2m91gU/WjYkNsAd4YI/AAAAAAAAGEs/o_jxRdOIzJ8pcCGvwe89CKCSJcTzFglvwCLcBGAs/s320/holly-bush-makeney.jpg" width="320" height="287" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="917" /></a><p>Best New Pub Visited ? the <b>Holly Bush at Makeney</b> in Derbyshire. Although it isn?t too far from me, for some reason I?d never previously got round to visiting it, possibly because it?s a bit off the obvious Peak District tourist track. It?s a great example of how a superb unspoilt pub interior, that appears on CAMRA?s <a href="http://pubheritage.camra.org.uk/pubs/historic-pub-interior-entry.asp?NatPubID=AMV/411&Detail=full">National Inventory</a>, can be combined with a thriving, enterprising pub offering high-quality beer and food. It?s also one of the rare pubs still offering beer from the jug. <p>An honourable runner-up was the <b>Hop Pole in Crewe</b>, a classic community local with a warm welcome and a largely unspoilt multi-roomed interior, plus that increasingly rare feature, its own bowling green. <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJZTfW5htXQ/WjYk2i_kISI/AAAAAAAAGE0/d101qbw5WA4Qp9QlNnllvsa_Ucb9O_JYACLcBGAs/s1600/olde%2Bblue%2Bbell%2Bhull.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJZTfW5htXQ/WjYk2i_kISI/AAAAAAAAGE0/d101qbw5WA4Qp9QlNnllvsa_Ucb9O_JYACLcBGAs/s320/olde%2Bblue%2Bbell%2Bhull.jpg" width="320" height="240" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="768" /></a><p><b>Best Pub Revisit</b> ? a couple of classic unspoilt Sam Smith?s pubs in East Yorkshire, the <b>White Horse (Nellie?s) in Beverley</b> and the <b>Olde Blue Bell in Hull</b>, neither of which I had been to for thirty years. The photo shows an archetypal group of pub codgers in the Olde Blue Bell. ?If it weren?t for all these modern medical treatments, most of us?d be dead,? one of them said, cheerfully. <p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p19lsfACW3I/WjYlBREpqJI/AAAAAAAAGE4/6OTeBtqT4BA3vKQWrXz7my84ncXG0OGeACLcBGAs/s1600/felix-020317.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p19lsfACW3I/WjYlBREpqJI/AAAAAAAAGE4/6OTeBtqT4BA3vKQWrXz7my84ncXG0OGeACLcBGAs/s320/felix-020317.jpg" width="320" height="240" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="768" /></a><p><b>Best Pub Cat</b> ? has to be <b>Felix of the Boar?s Head in Stockport</b>, who was a close runner-up last year. Big, elderly, fluffy and cantankerous, he?s a real character. I haven?t in general come across a huge number of pub cats on my travels, but I did encounter <a href="http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/meet-leicester-feline-chairman-meow-408447">Chairman Meow</a> in the King?s Head in Leicester, who has something of a claim to fame. <p><b>Sobering News of the Year</b> was being diagnosed with <b>Type 2 diabetes</b> at the end of February. This wasn?t a total surprise, given that my father had it, but even so it gives cause to think and reflect. I wrote about it in more detail <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/sugaring-pill.html">here</a>. It doesn?t debar you from drinking, and indeed I?ve visited more pubs, both new and in total, this year than last. However, it makes it more important to take general care of your health, and I have succeeded in reducing my beer consumption during the March-November period, compared with last year, by over 20%, mostly by drinking less at home and cutting out the odd extra pint that didn?t add much to the experience. There?s also a problem in distinguishing the genuine health advice specific to diabetics from the general messages which, as I?ve extensively dissected over the past ten years, are often highly questionable. <p>2017 saw the <b>Tenth Anniversary of This Blog</b>, which <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/now-we-are-ten.html">I reflected on here</a> with a summary of some of my favourite posts. I was also honoured to be awarded third place amongst British beer blogs by <a href="http://www.vuelio.com/uk/social-media-index/beer-blogs-uk-top-10/">Vuelio</a>, as shown in the sidebar. I?ve not managed as many posts as in 2016, but I?ve continued to address a variety of meaty subjects. If I had to pick one post from the year, it would be <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/the-undercutting-fallacy.html"><b>The Undercutting Fallacy</b></a>, about the delusional argument that ?cheap supermarket alcohol? is a major factor in the decline of pubs. The number and quality of comments continues to be very gratifying. However, sadly, I have had to reiterate the point that ?The comment facility is not provided as a platform for personal attacks on the blog author.? If you want to disagree in a cogent and polite manner, fine; if you want to have a go, you will be doing it elsewhere.  <p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RRFa4olvgvc/WjYmhR0mY0I/AAAAAAAAGFE/Q0aaNHDFS8smWApjfXKnxAHhBsYdP_x1QCLcBGAs/s1600/bottle-beer-twitter-bird.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RRFa4olvgvc/WjYmhR0mY0I/AAAAAAAAGFE/Q0aaNHDFS8smWApjfXKnxAHhBsYdP_x1QCLcBGAs/s200/bottle-beer-twitter-bird.jpg" width="200" height="199" data-original-width="480" data-original-height="477" /></a><p>My <b>Twitter Account</b> has gone from strength to strength. In May I passed 3500 followers, which I wrote about <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/the-lark-ascending.html">here</a>, and the figure is now approaching 4000, so plenty of people seem to like it. I was nominated as the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/a-rare-accolade.html">Worst Person on Beer Twitter</a> which, considering the source, I consider something of an accolade. It was also in relation to a tweet praising the use of traditional customary measurements, one of my favourite themes. As I said in the linked post, success on Twitter is as much about what you don?t say as what you do. Again, I?m happy to engage in intelligent debate, but if you start getting abusive you?ll be unfollowed and muted. <p>I was instrumental in setting up the <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/beerandpubs/"><b>Beer and Pubs Forum</b></a>, which was intended as a replacement for the now defunct CAMRA Forum. Yes, CAMRA have now created the new Discourse Forum, but that is an entirely different animal that is focused on CAMRA policy and admin and eschews any general or lighthearted discussion. It may not be the busiest forum in the world, but it ticks over nicely, and allows the stalwarts from the old forum, plus a few newcomers, to enjoy general discussions about their beer and pub experiences. Why not give it a go ? we don?t bite! <p>A great success of this forum has been in organising several trips out, to Macclesfield, Birmingham and <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/life-outside-bubble.html">Crewe</a>. The Birmingham one in particular attracted people from as far apart as Stockport, Stafford, Cambridge, Reading and Frome in Somerset. It?s always good to meet people you?ve only previously encountered via the Internet, and without exception they turn out to be nicer and less combative than their online personae. We?re hoping to arrange further meets in the New Year, with one pencilled in for Oxford in February. <p>It was also a good year for <b>Networking</b> in a wider sense. I met fellow bloggers <a href="https://pubmeister.wordpress.com/">Duncan Mackay</a>, <a href="http://pubsthenandnow.blogspot.co.uk/">Peter Allen</a> and <a href="https://beerleeds.co.uk/">Richard Coldwell</a> for the first time, although I haven?t yet managed to engineer an encounter with Simon Everitt of <a href="https://brapa-4500.blogspot.co.uk/">BRAPA</a> fame, despite having offered to drive him to some of the less accessible pubs in Cheshire and North Wales. I?ve also met quite a number of people, too many to list, who I?ve only previously encountered via Twitter. Richard Coldwell, Martin Taylor and I, together with Paul Mudge, did a memorable <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/loafing-around-leicester.html">Three Bloggers' Trip to Leicester</a>. <P><b>Best Ploughman?s ? the Anchor in Sevenoaks, Kent</b>. Nothing fancy ? just cheese, crusty roll, a bit of salad and a selection of pickles including a whole gherkin, and excellent value at a mere fiver. Other noteworthy pub food included a good straightforward cheese & pickle sandwich in the Black Swan, Devizes, steak in the Bowling Green in Leicester, and two meals in Mandarina in Macclesfield. But I encountered the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/sandwich-course.html">perennial problems</a> of being unable to find decent lunchtime sandwiches, and having to fall back on Wetherspoon?s, and of pubs failing to display menus outside. <p><b>Worst Service</b> ? every year produces a spectacular example of truly terrible service, generally in an independently-run restaurant. There seems to be something about being a single diner that leads to being completely forgotten. Last year was the Istanbul Turkish restaurant in Shrewsbury, while this year?s crown goes to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.edwardson.7/posts/1357240827726605">La Lanterna pizza house</a> in Banbury. Read it and weep, then go to Pizza Express instead. <p><b>Beer and Pub Blog ? <a href="https://lifeafterfootball839.wordpress.com/">Life After Football</a></b>. Written by former professional footballer Ian Clarkson, this concentrates on visting proper pubs in the Midlands. Although he likes his cask beer, especially Bass and Pedigree, it stands aside from the usual perspective of the ?beer world?.  Also a shout out to indefatigable pub crawler Alan Winfield of <a href="http://neverendingpubcrawl.blogspot.co.uk/"><b>The Never Ending Pub Crawl</b></a>, who managed to annoy a lot of people with some forthright comments on a craft beer encountered in Falmouth, but is now facing serious health problems. Best wishes to Alan that everything?s sorted out. <P><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lTO5J2qfi2M/WjYoGIJnUFI/AAAAAAAAGFQ/5UMEO7nMxXEBZNqyYGM_sfhaEK5eJVK2wCLcBGAs/s1600/20th_century_pub_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lTO5J2qfi2M/WjYoGIJnUFI/AAAAAAAAGFQ/5UMEO7nMxXEBZNqyYGM_sfhaEK5eJVK2wCLcBGAs/s200/20th_century_pub_cover.jpg" width="200" height="200" data-original-width="650" data-original-height="650" /></a><p><b>Beer and Pub Book ? </b><b>20th Century Pub by Jessica Boak and Ray Bailey</b>.

Let?s hope it goes from strength to strength in 2018. <p><b>Worst Public Policy ? Minimum Pricing in Scotland</b>, which was approved by the Supreme Court and is planned to come into force at the beginning of May next year. It represents an ill-thought-out, one-size-fits-all approach that is unlikely to be effective in addressing alcohol abuse and will make the lives of many people of limited means just that bit more miserable. It was depressing to see many people who claim to be supporters of pubs welcome it, even though they?re likely to be next on the list.

Last year?s is <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/highlights-of-2016.html">here</a>. It can?t really be called ?Golden Pints? as it?s really much more about pubs, pussycats, people and policies. During 2017 I have visited 183 different pubs, of which 95 were new to me, compared with 154 and 64 in 2016. In the remaining days of the year I?ll be adding a few to the total, most notably on the legendary <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/staggering-uphill.html">Hillgate Stagger</a> this coming Friday, but I don?t think I?ll be going to any more pubs that I haven?t already visited. <p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBCyn2m91gU/WjYkNsAd4YI/AAAAAAAAGEs/o_jxRdOIzJ8pcCGvwe89CKCSJcTzFglvwCLcBGAs/s1600/holly-bush-makeney.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBCyn2m91gU/WjYkNsAd4YI/AAAAAAAAGEs/o_jxRdOIzJ8pcCGvwe89CKCSJcTzFglvwCLcBGAs/s320/holly-bush-makeney.jpg" width="320" height="287" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="917" /></a><p>Best New Pub Visited ? the <b>Holly Bush at Makeney</b> in Derbyshire. Although it isn?t too far from me, for some reason I?d never previously got round to visiting it, possibly because it?s a bit off the obvious Peak District tourist track. It?s a great example of how a superb unspoilt pub interior, that appears on CAMRA?s <a href="http://pubheritage.camra.org.uk/pubs/historic-pub-interior-entry.asp?NatPubID=AMV/411&Detail=full">National Inventory</a>, can be combined with a thriving, enterprising pub offering high-quality beer and food. It?s also one of the rare pubs still offering beer from the jug. <p>An honourable runner-up was the <b>Hop Pole in Crewe</b>, a classic community local with a warm welcome and a largely unspoilt multi-roomed interior, plus that increasingly rare feature, its own bowling green. <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJZTfW5htXQ/WjYk2i_kISI/AAAAAAAAGE0/d101qbw5WA4Qp9QlNnllvsa_Ucb9O_JYACLcBGAs/s1600/olde%2Bblue%2Bbell%2Bhull.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJZTfW5htXQ/WjYk2i_kISI/AAAAAAAAGE0/d101qbw5WA4Qp9QlNnllvsa_Ucb9O_JYACLcBGAs/s320/olde%2Bblue%2Bbell%2Bhull.jpg" width="320" height="240" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="768" /></a><p><b>Best Pub Revisit</b> ? a couple of classic unspoilt Sam Smith?s pubs in East Yorkshire, the <b>White Horse (Nellie?s) in Beverley</b> and the <b>Olde Blue Bell in Hull</b>, neither of which I had been to for thirty years. The photo shows an archetypal group of pub codgers in the Olde Blue Bell. ?If it weren?t for all these modern medical treatments, most of us?d be dead,? one of them said, cheerfully. <p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p19lsfACW3I/WjYlBREpqJI/AAAAAAAAGE4/6OTeBtqT4BA3vKQWrXz7my84ncXG0OGeACLcBGAs/s1600/felix-020317.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p19lsfACW3I/WjYlBREpqJI/AAAAAAAAGE4/6OTeBtqT4BA3vKQWrXz7my84ncXG0OGeACLcBGAs/s320/felix-020317.jpg" width="320" height="240" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="768" /></a><p><b>Best Pub Cat</b> ? has to be <b>Felix of the Boar?s Head in Stockport</b>, who was a close runner-up last year. Big, elderly, fluffy and cantankerous, he?s a real character. I haven?t in general come across a huge number of pub cats on my travels, but I did encounter <a href="http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/meet-leicester-feline-chairman-meow-408447">Chairman Meow</a> in the King?s Head in Leicester, who has something of a claim to fame. <p><b>Sobering News of the Year</b> was being diagnosed with <b>Type 2 diabetes</b> at the end of February. This wasn?t a total surprise, given that my father had it, but even so it gives cause to think and reflect. I wrote about it in more detail <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/sugaring-pill.html">here</a>. It doesn?t debar you from drinking, and indeed I?ve visited more pubs, both new and in total, this year than last. However, it makes it more important to take general care of your health, and I have succeeded in reducing my beer consumption during the March-November period, compared with last year, by over 20%, mostly by drinking less at home and cutting out the odd extra pint that didn?t add much to the experience. There?s also a problem in distinguishing the genuine health advice specific to diabetics from the general messages which, as I?ve extensively dissected over the past ten years, are often highly questionable. <p>2017 saw the <b>Tenth Anniversary of This Blog</b>, which <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/now-we-are-ten.html">I reflected on here</a> with a summary of some of my favourite posts. I was also honoured to be awarded third place amongst British beer blogs by <a href="http://www.vuelio.com/uk/social-media-index/beer-blogs-uk-top-10/">Vuelio</a>, as shown in the sidebar. I?ve not managed as many posts as in 2016, but I?ve continued to address a variety of meaty subjects. If I had to pick one post from the year, it would be <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/the-undercutting-fallacy.html"><b>The Undercutting Fallacy</b></a>, about the delusional argument that ?cheap supermarket alcohol? is a major factor in the decline of pubs. The number and quality of comments continues to be very gratifying. However, sadly, I have had to reiterate the point that ?The comment facility is not provided as a platform for personal attacks on the blog author.? If you want to disagree in a cogent and polite manner, fine; if you want to have a go, you will be doing it elsewhere.  <p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RRFa4olvgvc/WjYmhR0mY0I/AAAAAAAAGFE/Q0aaNHDFS8smWApjfXKnxAHhBsYdP_x1QCLcBGAs/s1600/bottle-beer-twitter-bird.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RRFa4olvgvc/WjYmhR0mY0I/AAAAAAAAGFE/Q0aaNHDFS8smWApjfXKnxAHhBsYdP_x1QCLcBGAs/s200/bottle-beer-twitter-bird.jpg" width="200" height="199" data-original-width="480" data-original-height="477" /></a><p>My <b>Twitter Account</b> has gone from strength to strength. In May I passed 3500 followers, which I wrote about <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/the-lark-ascending.html">here</a>, and the figure is now approaching 4000, so plenty of people seem to like it. I was nominated as the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/a-rare-accolade.html">Worst Person on Beer Twitter</a> which, considering the source, I consider something of an accolade. It was also in relation to a tweet praising the use of traditional customary measurements, one of my favourite themes. As I said in the linked post, success on Twitter is as much about what you don?t say as what you do. Again, I?m happy to engage in intelligent debate, but if you start getting abusive you?ll be unfollowed and muted. <p>I was instrumental in setting up the <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/beerandpubs/"><b>Beer and Pubs Forum</b></a>, which was intended as a replacement for the now defunct CAMRA Forum. Yes, CAMRA have now created the new Discourse Forum, but that is an entirely different animal that is focused on CAMRA policy and admin and eschews any general or lighthearted discussion. It may not be the busiest forum in the world, but it ticks over nicely, and allows the stalwarts from the old forum, plus a few newcomers, to enjoy general discussions about their beer and pub experiences. Why not give it a go ? we don?t bite! <p>A great success of this forum has been in organising several trips out, to Macclesfield, Birmingham and <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/life-outside-bubble.html">Crewe</a>. The Birmingham one in particular attracted people from as far apart as Stockport, Stafford, Cambridge, Reading and Frome in Somerset. It?s always good to meet people you?ve only previously encountered via the Internet, and without exception they turn out to be nicer and less combative than their online personae. We?re hoping to arrange further meets in the New Year, with one pencilled in for Oxford in February. <p>It was also a good year for <b>Networking</b> in a wider sense. I met fellow bloggers <a href="https://pubmeister.wordpress.com/">Duncan Mackay</a>, <a href="http://pubsthenandnow.blogspot.co.uk/">Peter Allen</a> and <a href="https://beerleeds.co.uk/">Richard Coldwell</a> for the first time, although I haven?t yet managed to engineer an encounter with Simon Everitt of <a href="https://brapa-4500.blogspot.co.uk/">BRAPA</a> fame, despite having offered to drive him to some of the less accessible pubs in Cheshire and North Wales. I?ve also met quite a number of people, too many to list, who I?ve only previously encountered via Twitter. Richard Coldwell, Martin Taylor and I, together with Paul Mudge, did a memorable <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/loafing-around-leicester.html">Three Bloggers' Trip to Leicester</a>. <P><b>Best Ploughman?s ? the Anchor in Sevenoaks, Kent</b>. Nothing fancy ? just cheese, crusty roll, a bit of salad and a selection of pickles including a whole gherkin, and excellent value at a mere fiver. Other noteworthy pub food included a good straightforward cheese & pickle sandwich in the Black Swan, Devizes, steak in the Bowling Green in Leicester, and two meals in Mandarina in Macclesfield. But I encountered the <a href="http://pubcurmudgeon.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/sandwich-course.html">perennial problems</a> of being unable to find decent lunchtime sandwiches, and having to fall back on Wetherspoon?s, and of pubs failing to display menus outside. <p><b>Worst Service</b> ? every year produces a spectacular example of truly terrible service, generally in an independently-run restaurant. There seems to be something about being a single diner that leads to being completely forgotten. Last year was the Istanbul Turkish restaurant in Shrewsbury, while this year?s crown goes to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.edwardson.7/posts/1357240827726605">La Lanterna pizza house</a> in Banbury. Read it and weep, then go to Pizza Express instead. <p><b>Beer and Pub Blog ? <a href="https://lifeafterfootball839.wordpress.com/">Life After Football</a></b>. Written by former professional footballer Ian Clarkson, this concentrates on visting proper pubs in the Midlands. Although he likes his cask beer, especially Bass and Pedigree, it stands aside from the usual perspective of the ?beer world?.  Also a shout out to indefatigable pub crawler Alan Winfield of <a href="http://neverendingpubcrawl.blogspot.co.uk/"><b>The Never Ending Pub Crawl</b></a>, who managed to annoy a lot of people with some forthright comments on a craft beer encountered in Falmouth, but is now facing serious health problems.

But that doesn?t mean I gained any pleasure from the <a href="http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/17212/Portman_panel_rules_against_Tiny_Rebel_s_Cwtch_can_design.html">decision of the Portman Group</a> to require Tiny Rebel Brewery to change the design of the cans for their Cwtch Welsh Red Ale on the supposed groups that they had undue appeal to under-18s. And nor, it would seem, did my Twitter followers. That?s by far the biggest response I?ve ever gained for any Twitter poll.  <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">POLL: Were the Portman Group right to censure <a href="https://twitter.com/tinyrebelbrewco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tinyrebelbrewco</a> over their "juvenile" can designs?</div>?

The brewery have now <a href="https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/news/cwtch-vs-portman-group-the-lowdown/">responded in detail</a> to their decision, setting out clearly their concerns about the potential wider implications.  <br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><i>We?re not the victim here. The industry is. <p>This sets a precedent, but the boundaries on that precedent aren?t clear and the decisions are enormously subjective, and take in a very limited view of the world. How the hell do you not appeal to under 18s?! There is no clear difference between what is and isn?t allowed, and that?s a major problem. <p>It forces companies to be over-cautious in design, which is inherently limiting. Instead of designing something for what consumers would like, companies have to design bearing what the most prudish among us wouldn?t like.</i></span></span></blockquote>Taken in isolation, the matter is relatively trivial, and it doesn?t stop anyone from selling or drinking a can of Cwtch. The photo above clearly shows the relatively minor nature of the changes that were required. But the case does raise a number of more general issues. <p>The first is that the investigation was triggered by just a single complaint. Can we be confident that was from a genuine member of the public rather than some purse-lipped professional health zealot? And is it reasonable that one vexatious miseryguts can cause a relatively small business having to incur ? as they say themselves on their site ? costs in excess of £31,000? The potential scope for mischief is boundless. <p>It is absolutely clear than there was no deliberate intention on the part of Tiny Rebel to target children, and is it really credible that any child would genuinely mistake it for a soft drink? One point made in the adjudication was that 330ml cans are widely associated with soft drinks, but they have been used for many years for beers such as Gold Label and Mackeson, and are now commonplace for craft beers. The major soft drink brands tend to use minimalistic designs highlighting the brand name and completely eschewing cartoon characters. Might we see in future particularly types and sizes of packaging being mandated for alcoholic drinks to distinguish them from soft ones? <p>It?s also not hard to see this as a baby step on the road to plain packaging for alcoholic drinks, as suggested on Twitter:   <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Drip, drip, drip: <a href="https://t.co/OadTbFqSgW">https://t.co/OadTbFqSgW</a> ?

But that doesn?t mean I gained any pleasure from the <a href="http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/17212/Portman_panel_rules_against_Tiny_Rebel_s_Cwtch_can_design.html">decision of the Portman Group</a> to require Tiny Rebel Brewery to change the design of the cans for their Cwtch Welsh Red Ale on the supposed groups that they had undue appeal to under-18s. And nor, it would seem, did my Twitter followers. That?s by far the biggest response I?ve ever gained for any Twitter poll.  <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">POLL: Were the Portman Group right to censure <a href="https://twitter.com/tinyrebelbrewco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tinyrebelbrewco</a> over their "juvenile" can designs?</div>? Ebenezer Mudge ? ? (@oldmudgie) <a href="https://twitter.com/oldmudgie/status/940539100834263040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Of course it?s something that is open to debate, and several voices were raised in the beer world arguing that the decision seemed reasonable enough, for example by <a href="https://boakandbailey.com/2017/12/portman-group-v-infantile-can-designs/">Boak &amp; Bailey</a>. <p>The full text of the adjudication, including Tiny Rebel?s exhaustive attempts to defend their position, can be read <a href="http://www.portmangroup.org.uk/complaints/complaint-decisions/complaint-decision-details/2017/12/11/cwtch">here</a>. The brewery have now <a href="https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/news/cwtch-vs-portman-group-the-lowdown/">responded in detail</a> to their decision, setting out clearly their concerns about the potential wider implications.  <br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><i>We?re not the victim here. The industry is. <p>This sets a precedent, but the boundaries on that precedent aren?t clear and the decisions are enormously subjective, and take in a very limited view of the world. How the hell do you not appeal to under 18s?! There is no clear difference between what is and isn?t allowed, and that?s a major problem. <p>It forces companies to be over-cautious in design, which is inherently limiting. Instead of designing something for what consumers would like, companies have to design bearing what the most prudish among us wouldn?t like.</i></span></span></blockquote>Taken in isolation, the matter is relatively trivial, and it doesn?t stop anyone from selling or drinking a can of Cwtch. The photo above clearly shows the relatively minor nature of the changes that were required. But the case does raise a number of more general issues. <p>The first is that the investigation was triggered by just a single complaint. Can we be confident that was from a genuine member of the public rather than some purse-lipped professional health zealot? And is it reasonable that one vexatious miseryguts can cause a relatively small business having to incur ? as they say themselves on their site ? costs in excess of £31,000? The potential scope for mischief is boundless. <p>It is absolutely clear than there was no deliberate intention on the part of Tiny Rebel to target children, and is it really credible that any child would genuinely mistake it for a soft drink? One point made in the adjudication was that 330ml cans are widely associated with soft drinks, but they have been used for many years for beers such as Gold Label and Mackeson, and are now commonplace for craft beers. The major soft drink brands tend to use minimalistic designs highlighting the brand name and completely eschewing cartoon characters. Might we see in future particularly types and sizes of packaging being mandated for alcoholic drinks to distinguish them from soft ones? <p>It?s also not hard to see this as a baby step on the road to plain packaging for alcoholic drinks, as suggested on Twitter:   <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Drip, drip, drip: <a href="https://t.co/OadTbFqSgW">https://t.co/OadTbFqSgW</a> ?
