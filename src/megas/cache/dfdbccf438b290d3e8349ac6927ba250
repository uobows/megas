How on earth did we manage in pre mobile/internet times?<br /><br />First the great potato crisp debate, as referenced by our two Anglo-Saxon kings. I would agree that Walkers do make a fine crisp, and who better to advertise them than local football legend, Gary Lineker.  In my view though, Walkers have been supplanted at the top of the crisp tree by Pipers, whose crisps are heavenly. Pipers are not that widely available, but then I remember, neither were Walkers, 40 year ago.<br /><br />Now the nostalgia bit. Bryan, I didn?t get close enough to the flower stall to say hello. I didn?t really know Michael anyway, apart from him being my Nan?s friend?s son. I do remember the family having a rather fierce dog which used to scare the hell out of my sister and I, when Nan used to take us round to their flat.<br /><br />Liam K, thank-you for updating me on the North Star. I?m sure my granddad would be delighted to know it is still a pub worth drinking in. I?m pretty certain it was a Watney?s pub, back in the day; I may even have sneaked in there with my friend from school, but the memories not what it once was.<br /><br />The Swiss Cottage is a fine looking building, and it must have cost the owners a pretty penny, when it was re-built, back in the 60?s. The interior is rather sparse though; I would even say it is non-descript. Humphrey may have to stick his hands in his pockets, before long, as I thought the decor was looking very tired.<br /><br />Mudge, I was surprised to discover cask on sale at the Swiss Cottage. Whatpub put me right on that score. I would still have gone in though, as a pint of Pure-Brewed Lager would have been in keeping with the delights from Budvar, which I enjoyed later in the day.<br /><br />Russ, there still are plenty of decent pubs in London, it?s just a case of knowing where to look.

There are still thousands of people retiring or being made redundant in their fifties and sixties every year who suddenly have more time on their hands (I was made redundant a decade ago and have only worked sporadically since, which while not financially great means I&#39;ve been able to do more voluntary stuff, including for CAMRA). The only real problem facing us with that is that while life expectancy generally, and especially amongst the better off, is increasing, so inexorably is the pension age.";s:9:"link_edit";s:105:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6722137562852954269/4944765130433677472/comments/default/1573671811176956010";s:9:"link_self";s:105:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6722137562852954269/4944765130433677472/comments/default/1573671811176956010";s:4:"link";s:114:"http://baileysbeerblog.blogspot.com/2018/03/camra-is-not-alone.html?showComment=1521541994666#c1573671811176956010";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"Matt";s:10:"author_uri";s:52:"https://www.blogger.com/profile/00387170913578542671";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:24;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6722137562852954269.post-3152456662852902924";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-03-20T00:21:44.648+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-03-20T00:21:44.648+00:00";s:5:"title";s:53:"I should clarify that the work volunteering isn&#3...";s:12:"atom_content";s:150:"I should clarify that the work volunteering isn&#39;t &quot;required&quot;, but is &quot;strongly&quot; encouraged.
