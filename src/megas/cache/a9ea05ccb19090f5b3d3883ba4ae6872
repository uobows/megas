<p>Perfectly situated at the gateway to Sugarloaf, Sunday River and Saddleback, UMF is also smack in the middle of some of the best hiking, mountain biking, canoeing, kayaking, camping and rafting in the northeast.</p>

<p>Miles of trail running and mt. bike paths just off campus. Groomed Nordic skiing trails. Night skiing at Titcomb Mt. just on the other side of town. The swim-able, paddle-able, fly-fishing-able Sandy River running right beside its athletics fields. Flint Woods and Bonny Woods trails a short walk up the street from campus. And a quick drive takes outdoor enthusiast UMF students to the extensive Maine Huts &amp; Trails system, the Appalachian Trail, Mt. Blue State Park and Tumbledown Mountain.</p>
<p>But the University of Maine at Farmington and the great outdoors isn?t all just fun and games. The University also offers an <a href="http://www.umf.maine.edu/majors-academics/outdoor-recreation-business-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Recreation Business Administration program (ORBA)</a>, an innovative academic major with a four-season focus and an emphasis on the business side of recreation.</p>
<p>Developed with leaders in the industry, the ORBA program gives UMF students the skills and knowledge to succeed in a variety of outdoor recreation fields. Students develop a broad range of business knowledge, skills in writing and oral presentation, problem solving, decision-making, leadership and team building. ORBA also has a required internship, which provides students with valuable hands-on experience and a network of professional contacts.</p>
<p>UMF?s <a href="http://www.umf.maine.edu/majors-academics/alpine-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpine Operations Certificate program</a> is open to UMF students in any major and is designed to provide students with core skills for working in the skiing industry while also preparing them to earn PSIA Level 1 certification.</p>
<p>Alpine Operations uses Farmington?s Titcomb Mountain (just 7 minutes from campus) as its on-hill learning lab. Students run Titcomb?s successful UMF Snowcats children?s learn-to-ski program and also teach young adults, fellow UMF students and others how to ski and snowboard.</p>
<p>Both the ORBA program and Alpine Ops program not only bring students to the mountains ? they bring the mountains to the students. Industry experts from Sugarloaf, Sunday River, Copper Mountain (CO), Ski Maine, Winterstick Snowboards, Mountain Force Apparel and many others come to UMF classes as frequent guest speakers.</p>
<h2>MAINELY OUTDOORS ? ACTIVE OUTDOOR ADVENTURE!</h2>

A better plan is to get outside frequently on foot, on snowshoes or skis to enjoy some healthy exercise and beautiful scenery with friends and family. Winter hiking is challenging and has inherent risks, so you?ll need to be well prepared and self-sufficient. Here are some tips for comfort and safety in the winter woods and mountains.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e37107;"><strong>HYDRATE WELL</strong></span></h2>
<p>Winter air is dry and since you?re usually working pretty hard, you?re going to lose a lot of water through respiration and perspiration, and this lost fluid must be replenished. In cold situations, your body tends toward emergency mode, redirecting blood from extremities into your all-important core. Frostbitten fingers and toes, or worse?hypothermia, can be the result.</p>
<p>The solution is to drink a lot of water and drink often, as much as three to four liters in a day. Drink before you?re thirsty. Fill your bottles with hot water before setting out, and use insulated parkas around them. Take along a Thermos of tea, cocoa or soup for a much-appreciated hot drink at lunch.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e37107;"><strong>FOOD IS FUEL</strong></span></h2>
<p>For strenuous winter hiking, your body needs plenty of fuel for optimum performance. Food is fuel, and one of the joys for many winter hikers is the need to consume a lot more calories than normal. Eat before you?re hungry, and eat often. Carry a good mix of carbohydrates, proteins and fats in your pockets and pack, like jerky, cheese sticks, nuts, dried fruit, candy and granola bars.</p>
<div id="attachment_8645" style="max-width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8645" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acadia-snowshoeing-on-Beech-Mtn-07-CAREY-KISH-PHOTO-1-300x213.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing on Beech Mtn. in Acadia National Park.

Photo: Carey Kish</p></div>
<h2><span style="color: #e37107;"><strong>LAYER UP</strong></span></h2>
<p>Cold weather activities require dressing in layers so you can regulate your overall body temperature in response to changing environmental conditions and activity levels.</p>
<p>The base layer is worn right up against the skin. A good long sleeve top and long john bottom made of wool, polyester or a blend of the two will wick moisture away from your sweaty body and help keep you warm and dry. The initial mid or insulation layer consists of a fleece vest, sweater or jacket, worn on the move. At rest or in camp or if it?s really cold on the trail, add a main insulation layer, a down or synthetic fill jacket or parka. Finally, an outer shell layer of waterproof-breathable fabric keeps out the wind, snow and rain.</p>
<p>A ski hat and balaclava plus gloves or mittens and accompanying weatherproof shells help keep your upper extremities toasty. Spare gloves and hat and a second wicking shirt to change into are worthy extras.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #e37107;">TRANSPORTATION</span></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_8642" style="max-width: 405px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="responsive-image wp-image-8642 size-full" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hikers-on-Burnt-Mtn-near-Sugarloaf-JEFF-ACETO-PHOTO-f.jpg" alt="Hikers on Burnt Mtn near Sugarloaf.

Photo: Jeff Aceto</p></div>
<p>Your feet are your transportation, so be sure to treat them well with a warm pair of Pac-style or other insulated boots with a good tread. Wear liner socks under heavy wool or synthetic socks. Knee-high gaiters will keep the snow out. Ice traction devices like Microspikes or Stabilicers are a must for slippery trails. If you plan to venture above treeline, you?ll want plastic mountaineering boots and crampons. Trekking poles with wide baskets aid with stability.<br />
A quality pair of snowshoes will get you through the deep snow and require little more effort than regular walking, while backcountry Nordic skis require more skill but open up a whole new world of winter exploration.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #e37107;">PACK THE ESSENTIALS</span></strong></h2>
<p>For the winter trail, the ?Twelve Essentials? should always be in your pack: map and compass, ski goggles/sunglasses, extra clothing, headlamp/spare batteries, first aid kit, knife/multitool, lighter/waterproof matches, extra food, extra water, emergency shelter (bivouac bag or heavy-duty garbage bag), cell phone, and toilet kit (toilet paper, baby wipes, hand sanitizer).</p>
<p>Check the weather forecast before you go and leave a trip itinerary with someone responsible (or at least put a note on the driver?s seat of your vehicle). Pack along a healthy measure of common sense and good judgment and use both liberally on the trail. Have fun, but always remember that getting to the summit is optional, while returning to the car is mandatory.</p>

Photo: Carey Kish</p></div>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #e37107;">TAKE A HIKE!</span></strong></h2>
<p>With 120 miles of trails and 57 miles of carriage roads, Acadia National Park on Mt. Desert Island is an awesome place for a snowy hike. The Park Loop Road is closed in winter, but numerous public roads offer good access.</p>
<p>There?s more to the Bethel Region than downhill skiing at Sunday River and Mt. Abram. Tackle the high peaks of Old Speck or the Baldpates from Route 26 in Grafton Notch, or scamper up the open ridgeline of nearby Rumford Whitecap.</p>
<p>The Kennebec Highlands in and around Rome are home to more than a half-dozen easy to moderate hikes, like those on French Mountain, Mt. Phillip, Round Top, Sanders Hill, The Mountain and McGaffey Mountain.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:9534:"<h1>Unique ways to stay active, indoors and out</h1>
<p>Staying active in the summer is a breeze. Warm-weather bike rides, outdoor yoga, hiking, and paddling feel more like adventures than exercise. And waking up for that early-morning fitness class ain?t so hard when it?s 75 degrees out and sunny.</p>
<p>But during the winter ? when it?s not even close to 75 degrees and the sun isn?t anywhere to be found in the early morning ? we need a little more incentive. Embracing the snow is a solid way to start. Renting cross-country skis or snowshoes for an outdoor jaunt on the trails is a good way to work up a sweat and have a memorable winter adventure that?s worth posting about on Instagram. If you?re more of a ?stay inside where the snow and cold can?t reach me? kind of exerciser, there are a host of fun and unique classes around Maine. Slog away on a treadmill no more ? this winter, you can stay active with the help of a hula hoop, a jump rope, a paddleboard, and a pair of drumsticks.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #186096;">FOUR UNIQUE WAYS TO WORK OUT INDOORS</span></h3>

6:15 p.m. Thursdays at Body by John, 190 Riverside Street, Portland<br />
Jumping rope as an adult is way different than it was when we were kids. The equipment hasn?t changed, but our ability to jump effortlessly for hours on end HAS changed. This makes a punk rope class a challenging and sweat-inducing workout, which will have your calves aching for days. But jumping rope to loud tunes (plus all the burpees and high knees and planks in between) still retains that fun we remember years ago, which will keep you coming back. $10 drop-in, $60 for 10-class pass. Body By John also has spin, kettlebell, step and a bunch of other classes. <a href="http://bodybyjohn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bodybyjohn.com</a></p>

9:35 a.m. Tuesdays. Quest Fitness<br />
2 Livewell Drive, Kennebunk<br />
A couple of points we should get out of the way: 1. Yes, hula hooping is exercise. 2. Yes, you can hula hoop, even if you haven?t done it in decades. It might take a few weeks to get the hang of it, but you?ll have a grand time along the way during this class. There is plenty of time spent swinging your hips in the hoop, but the class also includes flexibility and strength, too, so you?ll get cardio and work those muscles. $20 day pass, $139 for 10-visit pass. Quest also has host of other great classes and an indoor saltwater pool!  <a href="http://questfitnessmaine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questfitnessmaine.com</a></p>

7:40-8:35 p.m. Tuesdays at Riverton Pool, 1600 Forest Ave., Portland<br />
Paddleboards are generally spotted on lakes, rivers and the ocean in warmer months, but this winter, the SUPs are coming inside for this indoor paddleboard yoga class. Yoga instructor Ashely Flowers leads the series, which is open to people who are new to paddleboarding or yoga. The SUPs will challenge your balance and the yoga will awaken your muscles. And if you fall in? No biggie. Just pretend you?re at a summer pool party. $125 Portland residents, $140 non-Portland residents for the series.  <a href="http://www.portlandmaine.gov/390/Recreation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.portlandmaine.gov/390/Recreation</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POUND</strong></span><br />
10:30 a.m. Thursdays and 10 a.m. Saturdays. Maine Pines Racquet &amp; Fitness, 120 Harpswell Road, Brunswick<br />
Pound is a cardio workout with drumsticks. It sounds peculiar at first, but once you start drumming those sticks on the floor and over your head to the rhythm of the loud music, you?ll feel why it?s such a fun workout. The sound of the sticks drumming in unison sounds cool, and it also feels really good to drum those sticks on everything. You?ll get your heart rate up and do lots of floor work too. $15 day pass, $100 for 10-class punch card. Memberships also available. In addition to all the tennis, Maine Pines offers a ton of fitness classes.  <a href="http://www.mainepines.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.mainepines.com</a></p>
<h3><span style="color: #186096;">THREE PLACES TO BE ACTIVE OUTSIDE</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BETHEL NORDIC SKI CENTER</strong></span><br />
Bethel Inn, 21 Broad St., Bethel<br />
You can rent cross-country skis and spend the day skiing the trails at the Bethel Nordic Ski Center (there?s even a dog-friendly loop trail). Or rent a fat bike or snowshoes, if you prefer. The 40 kilometers of trails here are groomed for classic and skate ski and include a mix of open fields with mountain views and woodsy trails with more challenging terrain. Even better, you can take advantage of the inn?s Ski, Swim and Sauna package. For $27, you?ll get access to the trails and the health club (which includes a couple of saunas), plus the outdoor heated pool. There?s also a tavern on site, so ski, swim, sauna, and drink.. Day pass for the trails costs $18 for adults, $15 for seniors, $12 for youth and kids 6 and under are free.  <a href="http://bethelinn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bethelinn.com</a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #21bad1;"><img class="size-full wp-image-8607 alignright" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RobertsFarmPreserve3_SBryanPhoto.jpg" alt="Roberts Farm Preserve.

64 Roberts Road, Norway<br />
There are 7.5 miles of trails winding through the woods at Roberts Farm Preserve in Norway, which are perfect for cross-country skiers and snowshoers in the winter. And there?s a steady stream of cross-country skiing clinics and snow-related events, including the annual Snowshoe Festival and Nordic biathlons. But what makes the place even more stupendous: You can borrow cross-country skiing and snowshoeing equipment out of the warming hut for free. Yep, free.<br />
<a href="http://wfltmaine.org/roberts-farm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wfltmaine.org/roberts-farm.html</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>TITCOMB MOUNTAIN</strong></span><br />
180 Ski Slope Road, Farmington<br />
Titcomb is a family-friendly place to ski ? downhill or cross-country. The mountain might be small compared to its bigger cousins in Bethel and Carrabassett Valley, but with day passes from $5-$22 and a kid-friendly atmosphere, it?s a cool little community ski area. The 16 kilometers of cross-country trails are pretty sweet, too, and Titcomb happens to be one of the few places in Maine where you can ski at night, under the trail lights. It?s generally pretty quiet out on the trails in the evening, so you can ski for hours and feel like you practically have the place to yourself. A day pass for Nordic skiing is $10. Rentals are also available. <a href="http://www.titcombmountain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.titcombmountain.com</a></p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:5803:"<p>FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUCKET LISTS ARE ARE ABOUT RESTAURANTS TO VISIT, OR BOOKS TO READ, OR CONCERTS TO GO TO. For skiers and snowboarders, they?re about checking off the best trails to be conquered. From massive resorts to small community hills, Maine has a wealth of terrain that you could spend a lifetime exploring. Here are five Maine ski trails that everyone should tackle at least once in a lifetime. They aren?t necessarily the most difficult trails in the state?there?s more to these experiences than an expression of raw skill?but they?re trails that are emblematic of the variety of skiing in Maine.</p>
<p><strong>SUGARLOAF</strong> offers a wealth of options, from multiple miles cruising down Tote Road, to the snowfields that top its iconic logo, to the relatively wild chutes and glades of the ever-expanding Brackett Basin and Eastern Territory. However, no trail says Sugarloaf to me quite like Widowmaker. It?s a perfectly cut trail, which rides the fall line as it curves from the King Pine Bowl toward the rest of the mountain. Since being cut in the early 1960s, the trail has been one of the Loaf?s premier expert runs, even used by the U.S. Ski Team for training at one time.</p>
<div id="attachment_8539" style="max-width: 471px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="responsive-image wp-image-8539 " src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/white-heat_sunday-river-resort.jpg" alt="White Heat trail at Sunday River" width="461" height="312" srcset="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/white-heat_sunday-river-resort.jpg 522w, http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/white-heat_sunday-river-resort-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of Sunday River Resort</p></div>
<p>At <strong>SUNDAY RIVER</strong>, there are almost too many runs to pick from, with eight peaks and more than 10 dozen trails. The cleverly advertised White Heat stands out to me. The trail, bisecting the White Cap peak on the resort?s eastern boundary, is a beast, to be sure. With an average pitch of about 30 degrees, and one side of the trail dedicated to burly moguls, it?s an exhausting and challenging run. But, more than just the terrain, I like the pitch that?s long been given for the trail??the longest, widest, steepest lift-serviced trail in the Northeast.? It?s a good reminder of English classes and sentence structure; while there are longer trails, wider trails and steeper trails, none beat Sunday River at the combo of long, wide, and steep on a single trail.</p>
<p>At the <strong>CAMDEN SNOW BOWL</strong>, the <span style="color: #000000;">Lookout trail</span> provides a view you can?t get anywhere else. The Atlantic Ocean and the islands beyond Camden Harbor, spread out like a canvas. It?s a view you can get from a few places on the hill, but it?s best experienced on the appropriately named Lookout. The trail swings to skier?s right from the summit, just a short shot from the top of the triple chair installed at the resort a few years ago. The trail, a black diamond, offers both steeps and scenery, dropping dramatically towards Hosmer Pond and the Atlantic beyond through thin stands of trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_8537" style="max-width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="responsive-image wp-image-8537" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lost-valley_brewster-burns.jpg" alt="Skiers on chair lift at Lost Valley.

Photo: Brewster Burns.</p></div>
<p>I?d argue that <span style="color: #000000;">Bull Moose</span> at <strong>LOST VALLEY</strong> is emblematic of the community roots of Maine skiing. To really get the full experience, you?ve got to ski the trail on a weekday afternoon, when hundreds from school ski groups descend on the mountain. Kids swarm all over the trails and fill the lift, which runs over Bull Moose. It?s iconic in the sense that it shows the importance of Maine?s community hills in growing the sport, and gives any skier an experience akin to those of us who learned to ski this way. It?s one of the few black diamonds on the hill, and doubles at the race slope for the Auburn resort. Short and steep (you?ll only link a few turns from top to bottom), but wicked fun.</p>
<p>If you feel like showing off at one of Maine?s ski areas, take a few runs right under the <span style="color: #000000;">Way Back Machine</span> at <strong>MT ABRAM</strong>. The Cliff, one of the two double diamonds at the resort, is just that?a serious drop that just happens to be right under the lift, in full view of everyone. If you?ve got an exhibitionist streak, it?s a run where you can show off your skills to the assembled crowds. Just make sure you have the talent to back it up ? otherwise, it?s a long trip down Fractured Fairy Tales under everyone on the lift.</p>
<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS<br />

";s:12:"atom_content";s:4702:"<h3>You wouldn?t forget your skis, your boots, or perhaps your poles when you head off to the mountains. You wouldn?t get far if you did. Ski area skiing is one thing ? heading out into the backcountry is another thing entirely. There are a few other essentials you should pack that can keep you safe and comfortable. Some things here may seem obvious, but then again maybe not. In any event, I never head out without these things packed safely away. You may not ever need them, but if you do, you?ll be mighty glad you packed wisely.</h3>
<p><span style="color: #d48f04;"><strong>1. DUCT TAPE:</strong> </span>Yep, good old duct tape. Now I don?t often take the whole darn roll (as much fun as that would be). I always have a full roll camping and banging around in the car, but when weight is an issue, I have to dial it down. Duct tape is like life insurance, property insurance and health insurance all in one. You never know when you might need it for equipment repair, to fashion a makeshift splint, to secure a bandage, or repair a tear in your jacket. Even just a small amount wrapped around a ski pole just below the handle is enough to power through. Be truly advanced and make it Gorilla tape. That stuff is virtually indestructible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #d48f04;"><strong>2. LEATHERMAN:</strong> </span>This is also akin to an insurance policy. While I?ve never had to use my Leatherman (which is actually named for the company founder and developer of the original?Tim Leatherman) for a medical issue, I wouldn?t hesitate to do so. It could be indispensable in fashioning a splint or crutch out of branches, or slicing off a piece of cord for a sling. It is far more frequently called into service for equipment repair. When I am trashing through the woods or getting ready to drop into something like the Left Gully at Tuckerman Ravine, I want to make darn sure my ski boot buckles and bindings are dialed in and perfectly adjusted. The Leatherman is a constant companion with just about any telemark bindings, which I find require a bit more love that alpine binders.</p>
<p><span style="color: #d48f04;"><strong>3. CLIF BARS:</strong> </span>I have friends who go on and on about the beauty of food, the pleasures of dining, how you only have a finite amount of meals in your life, so you might as well make them count. I don?t disagree. However, I am not going to bring an artisanal multi-grain crust Margherita pizza with fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella into the backcountry. When the priority is skiing (which only happens on days that end with ?Y? when there?s snow on the ground), I get by just fine with black coffee and a CLIF bar or two. If I really want to get fancy, and pump up the protein count, I?ll even pack a CLIF Builder bar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #d48f04;"><strong>4. SPACE BLANKET:</strong></span> I am not a worrier. I don?t panic easily. Yet I am often prepared, occasionally to just short of overprepared. Thankfully I have never had a serious incident while out in the woods backcountry skiing or snowshoeing, but if I did and had to wait it out and spend a night in the woods, it would be a whole lot more comfortable with one of these lightweight, reflective Mylar blankets. It can keep you off a damp surface and preserve precious body heat. It takes up minimal space and weighs next to nothing. If you?re carrying a pack into the woods, carry a space blanket</p>
<p><span style="color: #d48f04;"><strong>5. HEADLAMP:</strong></span> Like a space blanket, having a headlamp, or at the very least, a fully charged flashlight, can help prevent a minor emergency situation from developing into a colossal nightmare. Headlamps are great for hitting the trail super early, or can help ease the path home if you stay out in the woods a wee bit too long. And again, this small relatively lightweight item can truly save your bacon. If you try to hike Katahdin in any weather or any season, and a ranger stops you and finds you are not packing some sort of headlamp or flashlight, they will turn you around. Heed their wisdom and always pack some light.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:2893:"<h2>The investment you make in high-quality gear will pay off in the form of many safe, comfortable runs all winter long. It?s a matter of making safety a priority.</h2>
<p>In addition to tights, tops and a running jacket that protects you from the wind and the snow, make sure to stock your gear closet with these essentials.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>HATS ~ </strong></span>A hat or balaclava will help ensure that your face and ears are protected from biting-cold temperatures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>MITTENS AND GLOVES ~ </strong></span>Extremities are the first to freeze. High-quality mittens or gloves which keep you warm and protect you from the wind will reduce your risk of frostbite.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>EXTRA TRACTION ~ </strong></span>Products like Yaktrax, spikes, or even some heavier trail shoes can offer more traction in snowy conditions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>LIGHTS ~ </strong></span>A headlamp or hand-held flashlight will help ensure that approaching motorists, cyclists, and runners can see you, and that you are visible to them. Always assume that drivers have not seen you, and get out of the way.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>REFLECTIVE GEAR ~ </strong></span>To increase your visibility, make sure to wear a reflective vest, or clothing with reflective accents.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>DRY CLOTHES ~ </strong></span>Moisture will make you colder, so be sure to have dry clothes close at hand so you can change right away after a sweaty or snow-soaked run.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>IDENTIFICATION ~ </strong></span>Even if you don?t tune in on the run, it?s best to have a phone in case of an emergency, or carry identification that includes emergency contact information.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4999f5;"><strong>GO TO ROUTE</strong> ~ </span>It?s hard enough to trust cars when the weather is good. When the weather is bad and snow banks are obscuring sight lines, it can be dangerous to run on some of your normal summer routes. As boring as it sounds, having just one route you know you can run safely in any weather will keep you running outside this winter.</p>
<p>Last year, I had a 1.75 mile stretch of road that I knew was safe to run in any weather. I would go out my front door and run back and forth until I hit my goal for the day. For three months I ran that same route every day, going as far as 20 miles just back and forth. It wasn?t glamorous or exciting or all that fun, but it was one of the best winters of training I have ever had.</p>

<h2><strong>Take a tough Jersey girl with a tender spot for great beer, transplant her to Maine years later, and what do you get? A woman ready to take on the world of craft beer.</strong></h2>
<p>Meet Mia Strong, who with her husband Al, owns their tiny craft brewery in Sedgwick, Maine. Opened in 2013, Strong Brewing Company, whose motto is, ?Beer geeks to the core&#8230;we brew what we like and we like everything,? has already grown in small leaps and bounds, completing a third expansion just this March.</p>
<p>Strong Brewing Company was the product of hard work and crowd-sourcing, including a successful Kickstarter campaign and a Community Supported Brewery, similar to a CSA. While Mia currently runs the business/operations end and Al makes the beer, she will soon train to brew on their new system. One can only wonder what beer styles she has in mind.</p>
<p>I caught up with Mia recently and peppered her with questions about how her love affair with beer began. ?My mother was drinking <em>Paulaner</em> when I was in my teens. I snuck one of her beers and liked it. So long <img class="size-full wp-image-8348 alignright" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mia-strong.jpg" alt="?In the beer market...there?s plenty of room to grow. The diversity in styles is great for beer drinkers.? ? Mia Strong" width="400" height="162" srcset="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mia-strong.jpg 400w, http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mia-strong-300x122.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />to the Old Milwaukee I pretended to drink with my friends, dumping it out when they weren?t looking. A few years later I discovered <strong>Old Rasputin</strong> from North Coast. I took a four-pack of it to a party and a guy told me, ?Girls don?t drink beer like that.? I had a few choice words for him to set him straight.?</p>
<p>In four years, the Strong Brewing Company has expanded twice, upgrading the brewing equipment, adding a tasting room, partnering with two food trucks and working to attract a third food vendor for summer, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>I ask the million-dollar question: is there room for growth in the craft beer business?</strong><br />
Mia tells me, ?I agree with the Brewers Association that we have only 12.2% of the beer market, so there?s plenty of room to grow. The diversity in styles is great for beer drinkers.?</p>
<p>?We?re not afraid to try new recipes and we listen. Last summer, people were asking for a stout. We switched up our production schedule in order to brew one to have on tap.? Mia has two kids, so I wonder what?s on tap at dinner time, for the adults, of course. What beers pair with comfort food like mac and cheese? ?Something light, like our California Common Ale called <em>Locomotive</em>.? I?ve had it, and I agree. Goes great with clams and lobster, too.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:4573:"<h2>Find running camaraderie on the trails and the road</h2>
<p>Warm weather brings all the runners out, from the mighty fast marathoners to the easy-going jog-walkers. And while solitary runs on local trails suit plenty of folks just fine, running with a group has perks, too. Running groups are supremely social (which often translates to making new friends), and running with other people supplies a level of motivation that&#8217;s hard to summon on our own. Many of Maine&#8217;s running groups are free to join, or have a nominal annual membership fee, and most of them run year-round, too (sometimes in snowshoes).</p>
<h2><span style="color: #185e03;">Maine Track Club</span></h2>
<p>Maine Track Club has gathered local runners together since 1979. Open to all level, MTC has groups in several towns, including South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, Gorham, Scarborough, Sabattus, and Yarmouth. They also organize several races a year, and members have access to training clinics and social events. Membership is $25 a year. <a href="http://mainetrackclub.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mainetrackclub.com</a></p>

<h2><span style="color: #185e03;">Trail Runners of Midcoast Maine</span></h2>
<p>Trail Runners of Midcoast Maine is a free, year-round trail running group that meets a couple times a week in the Camden area (in warmer months, they usually run the trails at Camden Snow Bowl). Monday Night Dirt is a no-drop group run, which means beginners won&#8217;t feel left in the dust, and there are also runs on Wednesday and weekends. Find them <a href="https://www.trailrunnersofmidcoastmaine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the web</a> or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trailrunnersofmidcoastmaine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #185e03;">Old Port Pub Run</span></h2>
<p>Old Port Pub Run is perfect for Portland-area runners who are motivated by post-run beers. The group meets at 6:15 p.m. every Thursday, year-round, at Liquid Riot Bottling Company in Portland. Runs range from 3 to 5 miles, and socializing back at the bar follows. The group is free, but bring money to buy your own beer. <a href="http://www.oldportpubrun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.oldportpubrun.com</a></p>
<h2><span style="color: #185e03;">Fleet Feet Maine Running</span></h2>
<p>Fleet Feet Maine Running offers run groups its locations in Brunswick and Portland. The $75 fee includes three days of running (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), coaches, a year-long training program, and informational clinics. <a href="http://www.fleetfeetmainerunning.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.fleetfeetmainerunning.com</a></p>
<h2><span style="color: #185e03;">Trail Monster Running</span></h2>
<p>Trail Monster Running is for serious trail runners who aren?t shy of rain, mud, and snow. Membership is ?paid in the form sweat and blood on the trails,? which means you become an official member by showing up to run and volunteer. How fast you are doesn?t matter &#8211; the love of trail running does.<br />

";s:12:"atom_content";s:8832:"<h2>On the water, on a trail, or planking in the sunshine, sweat-inducing outdoor workouts beat a treadmill any day!</h2>
<p>From mountain biking and paddleboarding to outdoor boot camps and yoga in the park, you can find an outdoor activity that&#8217;ll have you panting up a storm and loving every minute of it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re brand-spanking-new to a sport, taking a lesson is always a good way to go. You&#8217;ll learn proper form and technique, as well as the best ways to stay safe once you&#8217;re out on your own (all things you don&#8217;t want to learn the hard way). Plus, that expert guidance will help you learn more quickly (bonus!). If you&#8217;ve already got some experience, there are groups, tours and events for you, too.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">PADDLEBOARDING</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>BEGINNER:</strong></span> Paddleboarding looks easy enough to figure out (it&#8217;s just standing up, right?), but it doesn&#8217;t come naturally to everyone. Start by learning the best techniques for getting upright &#8211; which can be harder than it looks &#8211; proper paddle form, and safety measure (including wearing a leash and PFD and being aware of weather conditions and tides). Outfitters around the state offer lessons, including <a href="http://www.wheelsnwaves.com"><strong>Wheels N Waves</strong></a> in Wells, <a href="http://www.coastalmainekayak.com"><strong>Coastal Maine Kayak</strong></a> in Kennebunk, <a href="http://portlandpaddle.net"><strong>Portland Paddle</strong></a> in Portland, <a href="http://soposup.com"><strong>SOPOSUP</strong></a> in South Portland/Cape Elizabeth, <a href="http://www.llbean.com"><strong>L.L. Bean</strong></a> in Freeport, and <a href="http://acadiasup.com"><strong>Acadia Stand Up Paddleboarding</strong></a> in Bar Harbor, to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>SUP EXPERIENCED:</strong></span> If you?re comfortable standing up on a SUP, then it?s time to start exploring. You can certainly chart your own course on Maine&#8217;s waterways, or sign up for a guided tour to places you might not think of. <a href="http://mainekayak.com"><strong>Maine Kayak</strong></a> in New Harbor leads sunset tours in Pemaquid Harbor, <a href="http://portlandpaddle.net"><strong>Portland Paddle</strong></a> leads tours to Fort Gorges in Casco Bay, and <a href="http://www.seaspraykayaking.com"><strong>Seaspray Kayaking &amp; Paddleboarding</strong></a> offers downwind ocean paddleboard tours that depart from Hermit Island in Phippsburg and end at <a href="http://www.sebasco.com/"><strong>Sebasco Harbor Resort</strong></a> (where a restaurant, bar, and outdoor pool await).</p>
<p>To really work yourself out, check out a paddleboard yoga class with <a href="http://www.koanwellness.com"><strong>Koan Wellness</strong></a> in York, on Lake Androscoggin with <a href="http://www.windsurfing-maine.com"><strong>Windsurfing Maine</strong></a>, or with an area paddle shop, many of which are offering SUP yoga these days. <a href="http://www.mainesport.com"><strong>Maine Sport Outfitters</strong></a> in Rockport offers SUP Fit classes to really work your core and get your heart racing.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>MOUNTAIN BIKING</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008080;"><img class="responsive-image alignleft wp-image-8301 size-full" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mountain-bikers_shannon-bryan.jpg" alt="Mountain bikers. Photo: Shannon Bryan" width="325" height="218" srcset="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mountain-bikers_shannon-bryan.jpg 325w, http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mountain-bikers_shannon-bryan-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" />BEGINNER:</span> </strong>Learn the basics with free weekly skills clinics in Portland. Sponsored by the <a href="http://www.bikemaine.org/"><strong>Bicycle Coalition of Maine</strong></a>, the Wednesday evening clinics are perfect for beginners. They alternate each week between novice clinics on the Eastern Prom and beginner to intermediate clinics on the Stroudwater Trail. <a href="http://www.sundayriver.com">Sunday River</a> in Newry runs a bike school with 90-minute clinics that include a bike rental and helmet. <strong><a href="http://www.llbean.com">L.L. Bean</a></strong> in Freeport offers Learn to Mountain Bike courses that include all equipment and instruction.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">INTERMEDIATE RIDER:</span></strong> Hit the trails on your own ? the <strong><a href="http://www.nemba.org/trails/maine">New England Mountain Biking Association</a></strong> is a great resource for trails ? or join up with a local mountain biking group for some trail togetherness. <em><strong>The Single Track Sisters</strong></em> is a free women?s group that rides regularly on Monday and Wednesday evenings (Mondays are great for beginners, too). NEMBA has several Maine chapters, including in the Carrabassett region, Midcoast, Central Maine, Portland, and Penobscot area. <strong><a href="http://greenmachinebikeshop.com/">The Green Machine Bike Shop</a></strong> in Norway leads group rides, too. For group rides (all levels welcome) that end with beer, check out the Bikes &amp; Brews events from <strong><a href="http://www.gearworksproductions.com">Gear Works Productions</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>GO AFTER IT:</strong> </span>Challenge yourself with a mountain bike race such as <strong><a href="http://cascobayevents.com/bradburytwelve">12 Hours of Bradbury Mountain</a></strong> in Pownal on September 16. You?ll compete against other area riders, push yourself harder, and have an incredible experience, too.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">OUTDOOR WORKOUTS</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b><img class="responsive-image alignleft wp-image-8300 size-full" src="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/yoga_shannon-bryan.jpg" alt="yoga_shannon-bryan" width="325" height="225" srcset="http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/yoga_shannon-bryan.jpg 325w, http://activitymaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/yoga_shannon-bryan-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" />BEND &amp; STRETCH: </b></span>Yoga is splendid for all levels &#8211; it?s great for strength, balance, and flexibility. But if you?re looking for an accessible workout that?ll have you inhaling warm summer air (rather than panting for breath), yoga is it. Many studios offer outdoor classes in warmer months. <a href="http://www.practiceyoga.com"><strong>Practice Yoga</strong></a> leads yoga classes on Ogunquit Beach every morning from 7:30-8:30 a.m. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nubblelightyoga"><strong>The Viewpoint Hotel</strong></a> in York hosts outdoor yoga with views of Nubble Light every Wednesday from 8-9 a.m. In South Portland, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kellyrichyoga"><strong>Kelly Rich Yoga</strong></a> offers yoga at Bug Light Park every Tuesday 6-7 p.m. and Sundays 10-11 a.m., and <strong>Willard Beach Yoga</strong> leads classes on Fisherman?s Point. In Portland, <strong>Ashley Flowers</strong> teaches 6-7 p.m. Wednesday nights at Payson Park. If you like to cuddle some baby goats after your workout, check out yoga at <a href="http://www.sunflowerfarm.info"><strong>Sunflower Farm</strong></a> in Cumberland.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>SERIOUS SWEAT: </b></span>Outdoor boot camps offer you the chance to sweat your brains out on the beach, on the grass, or up and down the bleacher stairs at your locals sports stadium. These boot camps are open to beginners, too, and offer heart-pounding workouts that?ll leave you exhausted and happy. In Kennebunk, check out <a href="http://getouttherefitness.com"><strong>Get Out There Fitness</strong></a> for 45-minute workouts at Mother?s and Gooch?s Beaches. <a href="http://biddefordsacobootcamp.com"><strong>Saco Biddeford Bootcamp</strong></a>  offers workouts on the beaches of Biddeford Pool on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/PortlandSweatProject"><strong>Portland Sweat Project</strong></a> meets every Wednesday morning for free fitness at various locations around town.</p>
