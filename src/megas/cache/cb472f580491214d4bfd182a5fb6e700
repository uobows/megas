I felt the lump in my throat. <i>"No,"</i> I told him, <i>"I should be thanking you for all YOU have done for American Music, and I can promise you one thing - as long as I'm around there will be someone out here who will make sure that people never forget just how great and important your work continues to be..."</i><br/><br/>I hung up the phone and I wept.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1465958820;}i:1;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17177806.post-3626881203251186145";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 16:41:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:11:"Called Home";s:11:"description";s:23493:"As you may know, every December I try to write something up as a sort of tribute to those who have gone on before us in the preceding year... it is a grim task that has seemed to grow more difficult as time marches on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pu-cC20Qf9Y/VoFGpgmM4JI/AAAAAAAAKEk/hBmtDFf3JTI/s1600/toussaintcvr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pu-cC20Qf9Y/VoFGpgmM4JI/AAAAAAAAKEk/hBmtDFf3JTI/s400/toussaintcvr.jpg"></a></div><br />The sudden passing of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2015/11/allen-toussaint-1938-2015.html" target="_blank">Allen Toussaint</a> in November took us all by surprise, and broke the heart of the Crescent City. As New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said at Allen's Memorial Service, <i>"He was as much of a New Orleans icon as St. Louis Cathedral or The Superdome,"</i> and now, in an instant, he was gone.

In late 1971, Chips Moman told him he had to come up with a 'bridge' for the song before he would record it on him. Staff songwriters Mark James and Johnny Christopher sat down with Wayne upstairs in Chips' office and hammered one out on an old upright piano. Moman approved. According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memphis-Boys-Story-American-Studios/dp/1617031992/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451424459&sr=1-1&keywords=memphis+boys" target="_blank">Roben Jones</a>, he liked the results so much that he flew Carson personally to Nashville to shop the tapes to Fred Foster at Monument, who told them <i>"I don't think the world is ready for it."</i><br /><br /> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VxrqNkq72r8/VoKVLfUiUsI/AAAAAAAAKFw/XA16ajz_xqY/s1600/columbia02741.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VxrqNkq72r8/VoKVLfUiUsI/AAAAAAAAKFw/XA16ajz_xqY/s200/columbia02741.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P3cf2d224af6d7ffdad4583b6038de6f7Z1x4R1REa2B1&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P3cf2d224af6d7ffdad4583b6038de6f7Z1x4R1REa2B1.mp3">Always On My Mind</a><br /><br />He may have been right... but Chips never gave up on the song. Ten years later (when he was producing <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Merle-Haggard-and-Willie-Nelson-Poncho-Lefty/release/1539065" target="_blank">Poncho and Lefty</a> on Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson), he and <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2015/02/bobby-emmons-blue-organ-hi-2090.html" target="_blank">Bobby Emmons</a> offered the song to Merle who declined to cut it for the album. Willie, however, said it <i>"bowled me over the moment I first heard it."</i> An absolute masterpiece, Moman's towering 1982 Memphis Boys production of it on Nelson will, in my humble opinion, live on forever... Bobby Emmons left us on February 23rd, Wayne Carson on July 20th.<br /><br /> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kwdIQv2k3g8/VoFdS2xiQLI/AAAAAAAAKFU/QLu6eYpwkPM/s1600/atlantic2530.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kwdIQv2k3g8/VoFdS2xiQLI/AAAAAAAAKFU/QLu6eYpwkPM/s200/atlantic2530.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P95d2065f1cb5fdf76ff01198263b4772Z1x4R1REa2F9&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P95d2065f1cb5fdf76ff01198263b4772Z1x4R1REa2F9.mp3">Soul Meeting</a><br /><br />The passing of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2015/02/don-covay-goodtimers-its-in-wind.html" target="_blank">Don Covay</a> in February, followed by <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2015/05/ben-e-king-its-all-over-atco-6315.html" target="_blank">Ben E.

In late 1971, Chips Moman told him he had to come up with a 'bridge' for the song before he would record it on him. Staff songwriters Mark James and Johnny Christopher sat down with Wayne upstairs in Chips' office and hammered one out on an old upright piano. Moman approved. According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memphis-Boys-Story-American-Studios/dp/1617031992/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451424459&sr=1-1&keywords=memphis+boys" target="_blank">Roben Jones</a>, he liked the results so much that he flew Carson personally to Nashville to shop the tapes to Fred Foster at Monument, who told them <i>"I don't think the world is ready for it."</i><br /><br /> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VxrqNkq72r8/VoKVLfUiUsI/AAAAAAAAKFw/XA16ajz_xqY/s1600/columbia02741.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VxrqNkq72r8/VoKVLfUiUsI/AAAAAAAAKFw/XA16ajz_xqY/s200/columbia02741.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P3cf2d224af6d7ffdad4583b6038de6f7Z1x4R1REa2B1&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P3cf2d224af6d7ffdad4583b6038de6f7Z1x4R1REa2B1.mp3">Always On My Mind</a><br /><br />He may have been right... but Chips never gave up on the song. Ten years later (when he was producing <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Merle-Haggard-and-Willie-Nelson-Poncho-Lefty/release/1539065" target="_blank">Poncho and Lefty</a> on Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson), he and <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2015/02/bobby-emmons-blue-organ-hi-2090.html" target="_blank">Bobby Emmons</a> offered the song to Merle who declined to cut it for the album. Willie, however, said it <i>"bowled me over the moment I first heard it."</i> An absolute masterpiece, Moman's towering 1982 Memphis Boys production of it on Nelson will, in my humble opinion, live on forever... Bobby Emmons left us on February 23rd, Wayne Carson on July 20th.<br /><br /> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kwdIQv2k3g8/VoFdS2xiQLI/AAAAAAAAKFU/QLu6eYpwkPM/s1600/atlantic2530.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kwdIQv2k3g8/VoFdS2xiQLI/AAAAAAAAKFU/QLu6eYpwkPM/s200/atlantic2530.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P95d2065f1cb5fdf76ff01198263b4772Z1x4R1REa2F9&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P95d2065f1cb5fdf76ff01198263b4772Z1x4R1REa2F9.mp3">Soul Meeting</a><br /><br />The passing of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2015/02/don-covay-goodtimers-its-in-wind.html" target="_blank">Don Covay</a> in February, followed by <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2015/05/ben-e-king-its-all-over-atco-6315.html" target="_blank">Ben E.

In <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/07/benny-spellman-if-you-love-her-sansu_28.html" target="_blank">2006</a>, I went so far as to dub him 'The Patron Saint' of the site, as he cut so many great B sides. The more I discovered about him, the more impressed I became with the impeccable quality of his work. In 2008, I posted a <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2008/04/chris-kenner-i-like-it-like-that-part-2.html" target="_blank">podcast</a> called <a href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pbb98f69bc3c28792f1f927462851e24aZ1x4R1REZGB2.mp3">An Instant of Toussaint</a> that pulled together some of the under-appreciated records he produced for the New Orleans label, and the hits just kept on comin'.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cosimocode.com/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JghmqMP3iUg/VkNbUq3RdxI/AAAAAAAAKB4/hDRcaZZ7PeM/s200/coscodebtn.jpg"></a></div>I didn't know what they meant at the time, but most of the 45s I was putting up bore that 'cryptic hyphenated set of two numbers' that would come to be known as <a href="http://cosimocode.com/" target="_blank">The Cosimo Code</a>. As we moved forward in researching and building the site in 2012, Toussaint and his work became more prominent than ever before, and the more we learned, the more it confirmed his importance in the development of the music.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BSjmzXzFPIc/VkNd9oLvjeI/AAAAAAAAKCE/uyVMNd9Fprg/s1600/IMG_7392.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BSjmzXzFPIc/VkNd9oLvjeI/AAAAAAAAKCE/uyVMNd9Fprg/s200/IMG_7392.jpg"></a></div>This past April, when John Broven was invited by the French Quarter Fest to moderate a discussion about Cosimo Matassa that would feature Allen and Deacon John Moore, he asked me along to do a short presentation on The Cosimo Code, and what it represents. I was truly honored, and not a little nervous, to say the least... after all, this meant I would be sharing a stage with <i>Toussaint!</i><br /><br />Before the panel, I told Allen that he was now 'the patriarch' of New Orleans music, and that I thought he was every bit as important a figure as Louis Armstrong or Professor Longhair - but he'd have none of it, and dismissed that kind of talk with a wave of his hand. I kept at it, though, <i>"You're the guy who called Professor Longhair 'The Bach of Rock',"</i> I said, <i>what should we call you?"</i> He looked at me with that sardonic grin of his and said, <i>"You can call me the guy who called Professor Longhair The Bach of Rock,"</i> and that was that.<br /><br />You can check out a video of the entire panel discussion on <a href="http://cosimocode.com/magic.html" target="_blank">The Cosimo Code</a>, but I wanted to include this short clip from that day here:<br /><iframe width="400" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD4sE16p660?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />Always at his best when someone else was in the spotlight, Allen's piano here is positively brilliant. I didn't know it would be the last time I'd ever see him....<br /><br /><i>"Music is everything to me short of breathing,"</i> he said, and now that music is all we have left. Rest In Peace, Southern Knight... this world is a smaller place without you in it.

The more I discovered about him, the more impressed I became with the impeccable quality of his work.

As we moved forward in researching and building the site in 2012, Toussaint and his work became more prominent than ever before, and the more we learned, the more it confirmed his importance in the development of the music.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BSjmzXzFPIc/VkNd9oLvjeI/AAAAAAAAKCE/uyVMNd9Fprg/s1600/IMG_7392.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BSjmzXzFPIc/VkNd9oLvjeI/AAAAAAAAKCE/uyVMNd9Fprg/s200/IMG_7392.jpg"></a></div>This past April, when John Broven was invited by the French Quarter Fest to moderate a discussion about Cosimo Matassa that would feature Allen and Deacon John Moore, he asked me along to do a short presentation on The Cosimo Code, and what it represents. I was truly honored, and not a little nervous, to say the least... after all, this meant I would be sharing a stage with <i>Toussaint!</i><br /><br />Before the panel, I told Allen that he was now 'the patriarch' of New Orleans music, and that I thought he was every bit as important a figure as Louis Armstrong or Professor Longhair - but he'd have none of it, and dismissed that kind of talk with a wave of his hand. I kept at it, though, <i>"You're the guy who called Professor Longhair 'The Bach of Rock',"</i> I said, <i>what should we call you?"</i> He looked at me with that sardonic grin of his and said, <i>"You can call me the guy who called Professor Longhair The Bach of Rock,"</i> and that was that.<br /><br />You can check out a video of the entire panel discussion on <a href="http://cosimocode.com/magic.html" target="_blank">The Cosimo Code</a>, but I wanted to include this short clip from that day here:<br /><iframe width="400" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD4sE16p660?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />Always at his best when someone else was in the spotlight, Allen's piano here is positively brilliant. I didn't know it would be the last time I'd ever see him....<br /><br /><i>"Music is everything to me short of breathing,"</i> he said, and now that music is all we have left.

Sam had a voice as big as the whole world, and a heart to match. Since I wrote this piece on him almost eight years ago his career had taken off, releasing over a dozen albums and touring all over the planet. Although he was nominated 22 times for a Blues Foundation award (including 12 for 'Soul-Blues Male Artist of the Year'), somehow he never won. That, my friends, is a crying shame.<br /><br /> <i><b>Rest In Peace Mighty Sam!!</b></i><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzpFMuRLyKI/AAAAAAAAB5c/bKCy7ojHgeU/s1600-h/AMY+990.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzpFMuRLyKI/AAAAAAAAB5c/bKCy7ojHgeU/s320/AMY+990.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132490810222954658"></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P69b84ca66c6148d4389d5de33e7dfa0dZ1x4R1REYWJ0&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P69b84ca66c6148d4389d5de33e7dfa0dZ1x4R1REYWJ0.mp3">Silent Tears</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.mightysam.com/SamBio.html">Mighty Sam McClain</a> is the genuine article.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzr9OeLphBI/AAAAAAAAB5k/bgJWDmnns3o/s1600-h/winnsboro.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzr9OeLphBI/AAAAAAAAB5k/bgJWDmnns3o/s200/winnsboro.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132693150404019218"></a>As one of a family of thirteen children growing up in Winnsboro, Louisiana, he learned early on that life wasn't gonna be easy. Singing with his mother at Church on Sundays taught him the power of song, and helped him realize that he had a special talent. By the time he was in seventh grade, Sam (with the help of his gym teacher) had put together a group of his own, and was earning some money playing parties on the weekends. Maybe his stepfather resented that, I don't know, but he made it a point to try and bring this gifted boy down, telling him that he'd 'never amount to nothing'. Within a year young Sam was gone, setting out on his own to prove him wrong.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsDuuLphDI/AAAAAAAAB5w/LeApSWiZvcc/s1600-h/main_photo.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsDuuLphDI/AAAAAAAAB5w/LeApSWiZvcc/s200/main_photo.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132700301524567090"></a>Heading up the road to Monroe, he got a job as the 'valet' for local bluesman <a href="http://www.littlemelvin.com/index.shtml">Little Melvin</a>. Travelling all over the South with him, he cut his teeth out there on the 'Chitlin' Circuit' in the late fifties and early sixties. When Melvin's featured vocalist <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/S/sonny_green.htm">Sonny Green</a> left to pursue his solo career, young Sam stepped up and took his place. As he began to make a name for himself with his full throated vocals, he became known as 'Good Rockin' Sam'. On a swing through Pensacola, Florida in 1963, McClain liked it so much that he decided to stay, holding down a regular gig at the fabled 506 club. Tom's Tavern, another juke joint across town, hired him one night and, apparently unable to remember the 'Good Rockin' part, billed him as 'Mighty' Sam. The name stuck...<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsROeLphEI/AAAAAAAAB54/GQN-uwdEqVg/s1600-h/Gibsons.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsROeLphEI/AAAAAAAAB54/GQN-uwdEqVg/s200/Gibsons.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132715140636574786"></a>In 1956, an aspiring Nashville songwriter named <a href="http://www.severing.nu/dgibson.html">Don Gibson</a> recorded a song he wrote called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dreams_(Don_Gibson_song)">Sweet Dreams (Of You)</a>, which made it to #9 on Billboard's Country and Western chart. It was picked up later that same year by Shreveport honky tonk hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faron_Young">Faron Young</a>, who would take it all the way to #2, second only to an upstart kid named <a href="http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/billboard/elvis_country_singles.asp">Elvis Presley</a>. In 1960, Gibson, who was by then a superstar in his own right, cracked the top ten once more with his own newly recorded version.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsRYuLphFI/AAAAAAAAB6A/Mz9oPXPFSqM/s1600-h/Patsy.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsRYuLphFI/AAAAAAAAB6A/Mz9oPXPFSqM/s200/Patsy.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132715316730233938"></a>In early 1963, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Cline">Patsy Cline</a> was finishing up work on an album with producer <a href="http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=102#">Owen Bradley</a>. The primary architect of 'music row', his sweeping vision and trademark lush orchestrations had revolutionized the 'Nashville Sound'. Although Cline was afraid she might lose her 'down home' audience, she couldn't help but be impressed with the quality of the sessions. Before the record was released, she would meet her end in that fateful plane crash in March of 1963. The version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=3437435&s=143441&i=3437402">Sweet Dreams (Of You)</a> she had recorded with Bradley was released as a single within a few weeks, and rocketed to #5 Country, while barely missing the Pop Top 40.

Itching to fulfill his destiny as a record producer, he approached Sam about travelling to <a href="http://www.fame2.com/studios.html">Fame Studios</a> with him up in Alabama (where he had cut demos with <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hallrick.htm">Rick Hall</a> back in his Nashville days) with him to do a session. Schroeder had set it up for a weekend, when Hall could spare the studio time, but Sam was reluctant to lose a lucrative Saturday night at the club. Finally, he relented, and made the trip to Muscle Shoals with Papa Don and his father-in-law.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbS-LphHI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/guaQQc0jcLY/s1600-h/JIN+197.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbS-LphHI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/guaQQc0jcLY/s200/JIN+197.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132726213062263922"></a>As Papa Don recalls it, Rick Hall didn't even come in for the session, and it was engineered by <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/penndan.htm">Dan Penn</a>. Nobody really had any material ready, and so they worked on a few 'old saws' like <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Georgia Pines</a> and, yes, <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Sweet Dreams (Of You)</a>. They were feeling pretty good about the results, until, as Sam tells it, somebody walked in with a copy of Billboard, and they couldn't believe their eyes. Not only was a version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=83479218&s=143441&i=83478777">Sweet Dreams</a> already climbing the charts, it had been recorded by some kid named <a href="http://www.cajunculture.com/People/McLain.htm">Tommy <i>McLain</i></a> who grew up in Jonesville, not fifty miles from Sam's hometown! Pretty spooky stuff, and McClain was convinced his 'career was over', even before it got started.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbjOLphII/AAAAAAAAB6Y/Vxaf_WNga58/s1600-h/Sweet+Dreams+Amy.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbjOLphII/AAAAAAAAB6Y/Vxaf_WNga58/s200/Sweet+Dreams+Amy.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132726492235138178"></a>Undaunted, Papa Don loaded everybody into his International Harvester and set out for Nashville, where he still had a few connections. Their first stop was old friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Cason">Buzz Cason</a>'s office, and he loved the tapes. Cason then called Bell Records owner <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/bell/bellstory.html">Larry Uttal</a>, who was hanging around Nashville looking for the next big thing. Convinced he had found it, he offered Papa Don and Mighty Sam a contract. Hastily recording Cason composition <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Good Humor Man</a> as the B side (as a way of thanking him with the 'mechanicals'), it was released as Amy 957 in the summer of 1966 (in spite of lucrative counter-offers from <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/01/dusty-springfield-so-much-love-atlantic.html">Jerry Wexler</a>, who was not Uttal's biggest fan).<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsix-LphKI/AAAAAAAAB6o/riCzsIzvE7w/s1600-h/Fannie+Mae.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsix-LphKI/AAAAAAAAB6o/riCzsIzvE7w/s200/Fannie+Mae.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132734442219603106"></a>Although not reflected in the Billboard charts, Mighty Sam's version of <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Sweet Dreams</a> was a big record in spite of (or maybe even because of) Tommy McLain's top twenty hit. Cason's infuence in Nashville (which I'm sure included WLAC), along with Uttal's in New York got it plenty of airplay in those markets. Before long, Sam was playing the Apollo, and things were looking good. His follow-up record, a high energy cover of <a href="http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Buster-Brown.html">Buster Brown</a>'s 1959 #1 R&B smash <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Fannie Mae</a>, kept him popular out there on the circuit, although it once again failed to dent the charts.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsj2OLphLI/AAAAAAAAB6w/EL1k7QyXu64/s1600-h/SAM+01.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsj2OLphLI/AAAAAAAAB6w/EL1k7QyXu64/s200/SAM+01.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132735614745674930"></a>On a return trip to Pensacola, Sam made what he feels may have been his biggest mistake when he took Papa Don to see <b>The Dothan Sextet</b> at his old haunt, Tom's Tavern. Schroeder, just as he had done with McClain, lured <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/10/james-bobby-purify-so-many-reasons-bell.html">James Purify and Robert Dickey</a> to Muscle Shoals, and the rest is history. After they hit the big time with <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=165398862&s=143441&i=165399185">I'm Your Puppet</a>, Sam says he 'couldn't even get Don on the telephone'. When I told Schroeder (who was kind enough to leave a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=17177806&postID=2435081836353796440&isPopup=true">comment</a> a couple of weeks ago) I was going to write this piece, he emailed me & said, "Mighty Sam was a very important part of my life. Unfortunately, he never did forgive me for not doing the same for him that I was able to do for the Purifys, Toney... etc. but God knows I tried. Sweet Dreams and Fannie Mae were the closest..."<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzspt-LphMI/AAAAAAAAB64/kJhK-ipNzWY/s1600-h/mightysampic.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzspt-LphMI/AAAAAAAAB64/kJhK-ipNzWY/s200/mightysampic.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132742070081520834"></a>In the <a href="http://www.sundazed.com/scene/exclusives/papa_don_exclusive.html">Sundazed interview</a> he goes on to say, "I guess he was just a little too black for the white market?not for me though. He was over the line even from <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/02/bobby-bland-ive-just-got-to-forget.html">Bobby Bland</a>. But he was a great artist?a great artist. And I really tried, man. You see all those sides I cut on him? We just couldn?t make it happen." I do believe that Papa Don was trying, as Sam's Amy sides, when you listen to them today, are uniformly excellent. Today's selection is the flip of his fifth non-charting single for the company, Dan Penn and <a href="http://www.spooneroldham.com/">Spooner Oldham</a>'s <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">In The Same Old Way</a>. With the possible exception of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/arthur-conley-in-same-old-way-fame.html">Arthur Conley</a>'s deeply emotional rendition, Mighty Sam's version remains the definitive one. The cool B side you're listening to was co-written by Papa Don and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/11/oscar-toney-jr-aint-that-true-love-bell.html">Oscar Toney Jr</a>, and released in 1967. I'm not sure where it was recorded, although the fact that Toney is the co-writer would seem to place it after Schroeder made the move to American in Memphis... the guitar work here is positively amazing! What do you think... <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=183414499">Reggie Young</a>? <a href="http://www.great-music.net/hinton.html">Eddie Hinton</a>? <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/moses-dillard">Moses Dillard</a>...? {ed. note 11/15: OK, I just confirmed it with ol' Papa Don himself - the single was indeed cut at American, and features our guitar hero Reggie Young along with the rest of the 'Memphis Boys'. Thanks, Papa!}<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rztl1OLphTI/AAAAAAAAB7w/tEioJ32KKEI/s1600-h/AMY+11022.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rztl1OLphTI/AAAAAAAAB7w/tEioJ32KKEI/s200/AMY+11022.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132808165333239090"></a>Nothing if not persistent, Papa Don would continue to release 'product' on Mighty Sam right up until the day he walked away from Uttal and Bell/Mala/Amy in 1969. Listening to these records today, as I said, it's hard to imagine why they didn't meet with greater success. You can check them all out on the excellent Sundazed CD <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Papa True Love - The Amy Sessions</a>. Once Papa Don had left the business (temporarily), Mighty Sam began working with his 'right hand man', <b>Charlie Capri</b>.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztnheLphVI/AAAAAAAAB8A/UkmB71GsIF4/s1600-h/Atlantic+2707.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztnheLphVI/AAAAAAAAB8A/UkmB71GsIF4/s200/Atlantic+2707.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132810025054078290"></a>Wexler finally got his wish, as Capri got Mighty Sam a deal with Atlantic Records in 1970. After only two singles that didn't make the charts (one of which was included on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159359670&s=143441&i=159359733">Atlantic Unearthed: Soul Brothers</a> last year), the big company lost interest, and dropped him (maybe going with Uttal wasn't such a bad idea after all). Capri's next stop was <a href="http://www.malaco.com/">Malaco Records</a> in Jackson, Mississippi, where they recorded the great cheatin' song <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Soul-Company-Malaco-Retrospective/dp/B00000IAYV">Mr And Mrs Untrue</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzttOuLphXI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/dlIpi-DXdLU/s1600-h/FAME+1478.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzttOuLphXI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/dlIpi-DXdLU/s200/FAME+1478.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132816300001297778"></a>Atlantic was the Malaco distributor at that point, and refused to pick up the single on an artist they had just cut loose. Malaco decided to release it anyway and, in what must have seemed like 'deja vu all over again' to Sam, they watched in disbelief as <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/11/candi-staton-how-can-i-put-out-flame.html">Candi Staton</a>'s version of the same song appeared on Fame around the same time. Candi's record climbed all the way to #20 R&B, while Sam's died on the vine. Unreal. As the market for his kind of music began to disappear in the mid-seventies, the once mighty McClain sank into a dark and desolate period that found him living on the streets, and eating out of garbage cans.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzszOeLphPI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/rr80Pts_tg8/s1600-h/ORLEANS.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzszOeLphPI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/rr80Pts_tg8/s200/ORLEANS.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132752524031919346"></a>Drifting to New Orleans, he came to the attention of <a href="http://www.nevilletracks.com/">The Neville Brothers</a>, who were instrumental in getting him recorded by the small <a href="http://orleansrecords.com/artist08.shtml">Orleans</a> label in 1984. An album would follow a few years later, after which Sam was invited to perform in Japan. A live LP (which featured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Bennett_(blues_guitarist)">Wayne Bennett</a> on the guitar) was released by Japanese label <b>DeadBall</b> in the mid-eighties.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs4a-LphQI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/zh2SHh7Mtzc/s1600-h/82666311562.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs4a-LphQI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/zh2SHh7Mtzc/s200/82666311562.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132758236338423042"></a>All of this brought him to the attention of <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,440593,00.html#bio">Hammond Scott</a>, and he became the featured vocalist on the 1987 Black Top release <a href="http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=255">Hubert Sumlin's Blues Party</a>. Although this is probably what caused Sam to be categorized from that moment on as a 'Blues' artist, at least he was working again. Relocating to Houston, he tried his hand at real estate, but the music was in his blood.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs6eOLphRI/AAAAAAAAB7g/kbraGdnRGP4/s1600-h/1093rotm.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs6eOLphRI/AAAAAAAAB7g/kbraGdnRGP4/s200/1093rotm.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132760491196253458"></a>A move to Boston in the early nineties was followed by the critically acclaimed Audioquest album <a href="http://www.stereophile.com/recordingofthemonth/946/">Give It Up To Love</a> in 1993. Now able to support his own band, Sam found regular work in and around New England, as well as touring the European 'festival circuit' every year. Moving to southern New Hampshire, he put down roots, and has continued to release great records right up to the present day, forming his own record label and production company in 2003.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztEiOLphSI/AAAAAAAAB7o/Q1FL3ZNAjMQ/s1600-h/sam07.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztEiOLphSI/AAAAAAAAB7o/Q1FL3ZNAjMQ/s200/sam07.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132771555032007970"></a>An unashamed Christian, Mighty Sam's music refuses to be categorized, and contains elements of Gospel, Blues and Soul, in a true reflection of what lives in his heart.

In addition to appearing on <a href="http://www.giveusyourpoor.org/moviecd/cd.php">the album</a> (released this past September), he'll be performing at the <a href="http://www.giveusyourpoor.org/events/concert.php">benefit concert</a> this Friday, November 16th at the grand re-opening of the Strand Theater in Boston.<br /><br /><a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Just Like Old Times</a>.";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2015/06/mighty-sam-silent-tears-amy-990.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (Red Kelly)";s:7:"summary";s:22787:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gou9Ut09hQ0/VYFjLQAxrqI/AAAAAAAAJ3w/wDuqyqwYNPs/s1600/Mighty-Sam-McClain1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gou9Ut09hQ0/VYFjLQAxrqI/AAAAAAAAJ3w/wDuqyqwYNPs/s400/Mighty-Sam-McClain1.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qmoe2EOlGm8/VYFjT9iB7NI/AAAAAAAAJ34/0MbnKVLRuc8/s1600/mcclainrip.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qmoe2EOlGm8/VYFjT9iB7NI/AAAAAAAAJ34/0MbnKVLRuc8/s320/mcclainrip.jpg"></a></div>I just got the sad news that the great Mighty Sam McClain has passed on due to complications from a severe stroke he suffered back in April. Sam had a voice as big as the whole world, and a heart to match. Since I wrote this piece on him almost eight years ago his career had taken off, releasing over a dozen albums and touring all over the planet. Although he was nominated 22 times for a Blues Foundation award (including 12 for 'Soul-Blues Male Artist of the Year'), somehow he never won. That, my friends, is a crying shame.<br /><br /> <i><b>Rest In Peace Mighty Sam!!</b></i><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzpFMuRLyKI/AAAAAAAAB5c/bKCy7ojHgeU/s1600-h/AMY+990.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzpFMuRLyKI/AAAAAAAAB5c/bKCy7ojHgeU/s320/AMY+990.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132490810222954658"></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P69b84ca66c6148d4389d5de33e7dfa0dZ1x4R1REYWJ0&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P69b84ca66c6148d4389d5de33e7dfa0dZ1x4R1REYWJ0.mp3">Silent Tears</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.mightysam.com/SamBio.html">Mighty Sam McClain</a> is the genuine article.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzr9OeLphBI/AAAAAAAAB5k/bgJWDmnns3o/s1600-h/winnsboro.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzr9OeLphBI/AAAAAAAAB5k/bgJWDmnns3o/s200/winnsboro.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132693150404019218"></a>As one of a family of thirteen children growing up in Winnsboro, Louisiana, he learned early on that life wasn't gonna be easy. Singing with his mother at Church on Sundays taught him the power of song, and helped him realize that he had a special talent. By the time he was in seventh grade, Sam (with the help of his gym teacher) had put together a group of his own, and was earning some money playing parties on the weekends. Maybe his stepfather resented that, I don't know, but he made it a point to try and bring this gifted boy down, telling him that he'd 'never amount to nothing'. Within a year young Sam was gone, setting out on his own to prove him wrong.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsDuuLphDI/AAAAAAAAB5w/LeApSWiZvcc/s1600-h/main_photo.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsDuuLphDI/AAAAAAAAB5w/LeApSWiZvcc/s200/main_photo.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132700301524567090"></a>Heading up the road to Monroe, he got a job as the 'valet' for local bluesman <a href="http://www.littlemelvin.com/index.shtml">Little Melvin</a>. Travelling all over the South with him, he cut his teeth out there on the 'Chitlin' Circuit' in the late fifties and early sixties. When Melvin's featured vocalist <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/S/sonny_green.htm">Sonny Green</a> left to pursue his solo career, young Sam stepped up and took his place. As he began to make a name for himself with his full throated vocals, he became known as 'Good Rockin' Sam'. On a swing through Pensacola, Florida in 1963, McClain liked it so much that he decided to stay, holding down a regular gig at the fabled 506 club. Tom's Tavern, another juke joint across town, hired him one night and, apparently unable to remember the 'Good Rockin' part, billed him as 'Mighty' Sam. The name stuck...<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsROeLphEI/AAAAAAAAB54/GQN-uwdEqVg/s1600-h/Gibsons.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsROeLphEI/AAAAAAAAB54/GQN-uwdEqVg/s200/Gibsons.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132715140636574786"></a>In 1956, an aspiring Nashville songwriter named <a href="http://www.severing.nu/dgibson.html">Don Gibson</a> recorded a song he wrote called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dreams_(Don_Gibson_song)">Sweet Dreams (Of You)</a>, which made it to #9 on Billboard's Country and Western chart. It was picked up later that same year by Shreveport honky tonk hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faron_Young">Faron Young</a>, who would take it all the way to #2, second only to an upstart kid named <a href="http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/billboard/elvis_country_singles.asp">Elvis Presley</a>. In 1960, Gibson, who was by then a superstar in his own right, cracked the top ten once more with his own newly recorded version.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsRYuLphFI/AAAAAAAAB6A/Mz9oPXPFSqM/s1600-h/Patsy.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsRYuLphFI/AAAAAAAAB6A/Mz9oPXPFSqM/s200/Patsy.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132715316730233938"></a>In early 1963, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Cline">Patsy Cline</a> was finishing up work on an album with producer <a href="http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=102#">Owen Bradley</a>. The primary architect of 'music row', his sweeping vision and trademark lush orchestrations had revolutionized the 'Nashville Sound'. Although Cline was afraid she might lose her 'down home' audience, she couldn't help but be impressed with the quality of the sessions. Before the record was released, she would meet her end in that fateful plane crash in March of 1963.

Itching to fulfill his destiny as a record producer, he approached Sam about travelling to <a href="http://www.fame2.com/studios.html">Fame Studios</a> with him up in Alabama (where he had cut demos with <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hallrick.htm">Rick Hall</a> back in his Nashville days) with him to do a session. Schroeder had set it up for a weekend, when Hall could spare the studio time, but Sam was reluctant to lose a lucrative Saturday night at the club. Finally, he relented, and made the trip to Muscle Shoals with Papa Don and his father-in-law.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbS-LphHI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/guaQQc0jcLY/s1600-h/JIN+197.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbS-LphHI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/guaQQc0jcLY/s200/JIN+197.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132726213062263922"></a>As Papa Don recalls it, Rick Hall didn't even come in for the session, and it was engineered by <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/penndan.htm">Dan Penn</a>. Nobody really had any material ready, and so they worked on a few 'old saws' like <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Georgia Pines</a> and, yes, <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Sweet Dreams (Of You)</a>. They were feeling pretty good about the results, until, as Sam tells it, somebody walked in with a copy of Billboard, and they couldn't believe their eyes. Not only was a version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=83479218&s=143441&i=83478777">Sweet Dreams</a> already climbing the charts, it had been recorded by some kid named <a href="http://www.cajunculture.com/People/McLain.htm">Tommy <i>McLain</i></a> who grew up in Jonesville, not fifty miles from Sam's hometown! Pretty spooky stuff, and McClain was convinced his 'career was over', even before it got started.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbjOLphII/AAAAAAAAB6Y/Vxaf_WNga58/s1600-h/Sweet+Dreams+Amy.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzsbjOLphII/AAAAAAAAB6Y/Vxaf_WNga58/s200/Sweet+Dreams+Amy.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132726492235138178"></a>Undaunted, Papa Don loaded everybody into his International Harvester and set out for Nashville, where he still had a few connections. Their first stop was old friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Cason">Buzz Cason</a>'s office, and he loved the tapes. Cason then called Bell Records owner <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/bell/bellstory.html">Larry Uttal</a>, who was hanging around Nashville looking for the next big thing. Convinced he had found it, he offered Papa Don and Mighty Sam a contract. Hastily recording Cason composition <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Good Humor Man</a> as the B side (as a way of thanking him with the 'mechanicals'), it was released as Amy 957 in the summer of 1966 (in spite of lucrative counter-offers from <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/01/dusty-springfield-so-much-love-atlantic.html">Jerry Wexler</a>, who was not Uttal's biggest fan).<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsix-LphKI/AAAAAAAAB6o/riCzsIzvE7w/s1600-h/Fannie+Mae.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsix-LphKI/AAAAAAAAB6o/riCzsIzvE7w/s200/Fannie+Mae.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132734442219603106"></a>Although not reflected in the Billboard charts, Mighty Sam's version of <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Sweet Dreams</a> was a big record in spite of (or maybe even because of) Tommy McLain's top twenty hit. Cason's infuence in Nashville (which I'm sure included WLAC), along with Uttal's in New York got it plenty of airplay in those markets. Before long, Sam was playing the Apollo, and things were looking good. His follow-up record, a high energy cover of <a href="http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Buster-Brown.html">Buster Brown</a>'s 1959 #1 R&B smash <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Fannie Mae</a>, kept him popular out there on the circuit, although it once again failed to dent the charts.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsj2OLphLI/AAAAAAAAB6w/EL1k7QyXu64/s1600-h/SAM+01.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzsj2OLphLI/AAAAAAAAB6w/EL1k7QyXu64/s200/SAM+01.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132735614745674930"></a>On a return trip to Pensacola, Sam made what he feels may have been his biggest mistake when he took Papa Don to see <b>The Dothan Sextet</b> at his old haunt, Tom's Tavern. Schroeder, just as he had done with McClain, lured <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/10/james-bobby-purify-so-many-reasons-bell.html">James Purify and Robert Dickey</a> to Muscle Shoals, and the rest is history.

When I told Schroeder (who was kind enough to leave a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=17177806&postID=2435081836353796440&isPopup=true">comment</a> a couple of weeks ago) I was going to write this piece, he emailed me & said, "Mighty Sam was a very important part of my life.

He was over the line even from <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/02/bobby-bland-ive-just-got-to-forget.html">Bobby Bland</a>. But he was a great artist?a great artist. And I really tried, man. You see all those sides I cut on him? We just couldn?t make it happen." I do believe that Papa Don was trying, as Sam's Amy sides, when you listen to them today, are uniformly excellent. Today's selection is the flip of his fifth non-charting single for the company, Dan Penn and <a href="http://www.spooneroldham.com/">Spooner Oldham</a>'s <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">In The Same Old Way</a>. With the possible exception of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/arthur-conley-in-same-old-way-fame.html">Arthur Conley</a>'s deeply emotional rendition, Mighty Sam's version remains the definitive one. The cool B side you're listening to was co-written by Papa Don and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/11/oscar-toney-jr-aint-that-true-love-bell.html">Oscar Toney Jr</a>, and released in 1967. I'm not sure where it was recorded, although the fact that Toney is the co-writer would seem to place it after Schroeder made the move to American in Memphis... the guitar work here is positively amazing!

Listening to these records today, as I said, it's hard to imagine why they didn't meet with greater success. You can check them all out on the excellent Sundazed CD <a href="http://sundazed.4ecommerce.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SC+11083">Papa True Love - The Amy Sessions</a>. Once Papa Don had left the business (temporarily), Mighty Sam began working with his 'right hand man', <b>Charlie Capri</b>.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztnheLphVI/AAAAAAAAB8A/UkmB71GsIF4/s1600-h/Atlantic+2707.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RztnheLphVI/AAAAAAAAB8A/UkmB71GsIF4/s200/Atlantic+2707.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132810025054078290"></a>Wexler finally got his wish, as Capri got Mighty Sam a deal with Atlantic Records in 1970. After only two singles that didn't make the charts (one of which was included on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159359670&s=143441&i=159359733">Atlantic Unearthed: Soul Brothers</a> last year), the big company lost interest, and dropped him (maybe going with Uttal wasn't such a bad idea after all). Capri's next stop was <a href="http://www.malaco.com/">Malaco Records</a> in Jackson, Mississippi, where they recorded the great cheatin' song <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Soul-Company-Malaco-Retrospective/dp/B00000IAYV">Mr And Mrs Untrue</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzttOuLphXI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/dlIpi-DXdLU/s1600-h/FAME+1478.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzttOuLphXI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/dlIpi-DXdLU/s200/FAME+1478.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132816300001297778"></a>Atlantic was the Malaco distributor at that point, and refused to pick up the single on an artist they had just cut loose. Malaco decided to release it anyway and, in what must have seemed like 'deja vu all over again' to Sam, they watched in disbelief as <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/11/candi-staton-how-can-i-put-out-flame.html">Candi Staton</a>'s version of the same song appeared on Fame around the same time. Candi's record climbed all the way to #20 R&B, while Sam's died on the vine. Unreal. As the market for his kind of music began to disappear in the mid-seventies, the once mighty McClain sank into a dark and desolate period that found him living on the streets, and eating out of garbage cans.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzszOeLphPI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/rr80Pts_tg8/s1600-h/ORLEANS.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RzszOeLphPI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/rr80Pts_tg8/s200/ORLEANS.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132752524031919346"></a>Drifting to New Orleans, he came to the attention of <a href="http://www.nevilletracks.com/">The Neville Brothers</a>, who were instrumental in getting him recorded by the small <a href="http://orleansrecords.com/artist08.shtml">Orleans</a> label in 1984. An album would follow a few years later, after which Sam was invited to perform in Japan. A live LP (which featured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Bennett_(blues_guitarist)">Wayne Bennett</a> on the guitar) was released by Japanese label <b>DeadBall</b> in the mid-eighties.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs4a-LphQI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/zh2SHh7Mtzc/s1600-h/82666311562.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/Rzs4a-LphQI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/zh2SHh7Mtzc/s200/82666311562.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132758236338423042"></a>All of this brought him to the attention of <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,440593,00.html#bio">Hammond Scott</a>, and he became the featured vocalist on the 1987 Black Top release <a href="http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=255">Hubert Sumlin's Blues Party</a>. Although this is probably what caused Sam to be categorized from that moment on as a 'Blues' artist, at least he was working again.

A much-loved figure throughout his long career, his warmth and love of the music shone through every note that Percy Sledge sang...<br /><br />Here's an appreciation of Percy I wrote back in 2006:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/765481/ATLANTIC%202679.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/650767/ATLANTIC%202679.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P30916c42851b2fd6a51e314fa32faf89Z1x4R1REY2V3&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P30916c42851b2fd6a51e314fa32faf89Z1x4R1REY2V3.mp3">True Love Travels On A Gravel Road</a><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/680492/percy_sledge.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/700246/percy_sledge.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Today's selection presented me with a bit of a problem. I had found it listed as both an <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/percy.htm">A side</a> and a <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/psledge.htm">B side</a>, and was counting on the Atlantic discography at Global Dog to be the tiebreaker... only they seem to now be <a href="http://www.globaldogproductions.com/atlantic.html">toast</a> [Ed. Note: as of 1/7 <a href="http://www.globaldogproductions.com/atlantic.html">Global Dog</a> appears to be back in business. The verdict? - B side!]. In any event, this song you're listening to now is, in my opinion, the best (OK-second best) thing <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/sledgep.htm">Percy Sledge</a> ever recorded, and one of my favorite soul songs by anybody ever.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/44135/shadows.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/570887/shadows.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I first heard it when Peter Guralnick included it as the opening track on the companion CD to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Soul-Music-Southern-Freedom/dp/0316332739">Sweet Soul Music</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000002LR9/ref=dp_olp_2/002-4596516-8675245">Voices From The Shadows</a>, in 1992. As many of you know, this was right around the time my wife and I got engaged. The song was high in the rotation in those days, and still does either one of us in... I have yet to listen to it all the way through without jumping out of the ol' chair and singing along with a lump in my throat. I know, I'm a sap. <br /><br />For whatever reason, this song doesn't seem to get any press whatsoever. The silly album reviews of Percy's various greatest hits CDs in places like the 'all' music guide fail to even mention it. Who knows why. B side or not, I wanted to kinda wind down this year's posts with one of my true desert island 45s...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/783971/FAME%206401%20B.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/592723/FAME%206401%20B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lyavqj3yojaa~T1">Quin Ivy</a> is yet another of those southern white boys who grew up listening to John R and Hoss Allen over WLAC. He fell in love with the music, and before long was emulating his heroes spinning R&B records as a dee-jay on his hometown radio station in Oxford, Mississippi. He moved on to WMPS in Memphis before landing a job on WLAY in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in the early sixties. Like everyone else in town back then, he got caught up in the 'songwriting fever' that was going around, and began writing lyrics for a young <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hallrick.htm">Rick Hall</a>. Ivy was Hall's co-writer on two early <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Jimmy Hughes</a> recordings, <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">I'm Qualified</a> and <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Lolly Pops, Lace And Lipstick</a>, the B side of Fame's first release, top 20 R&B hit <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Steal Away</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/267039/marlingreene.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/138715/marlingreene.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Quin opened a record store in Sheffield called Tune Town, and watched as Rick's new Fame studio grew. Fame soon had more business than it could handle, and Ivy approached Hall with an idea; what if he were to open his own small studio to record the people Hall was turning away? Rick was all for it, and Ivy opened his Norala (presumably Northern Alabama) studio across the street from Tune Town in late 1965. He had initially asked Rick to let him hire <a href="http://www.boxtops.com/btpenn.htm">Dan Penn</a> as his engineer, but he turned him down and introduced him to local guitarist <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/hideki_wtnb/marlingreene.html">Marlin Greene</a> instead. The two became fast friends, and Ivy soon gave him a percentage of the business.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/799876/P02581XM625.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/821606/P02581XM625.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Although there appears to be several versions of the story, this is basically what happened next; Jimmy Hughes' cousin was an orderly at Colbert County Hospital, and had begun singing with a local combo called the Esquires nights and weekends. The band was working the same fraternity circuit that the Fairlanes and the Mark Vs had done a few short years before. Percy Sledge and fellow Esquires Calvin Lewis and Andrew Wright had come up with a song that they thought could be a hit. They loaded Wright's Hammond B3 into the back of a pickup and hauled it down to Fame. Dan Penn recorded the tune, and pleaded with Hall for a chance to produce them. Rick flatly refused, and Dan sent them over to see Ivy at Norala.<br /><br /> <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/173335/percy%20live.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/740069/percy%20live.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://www.jimmyjohnsonmusic.com/">Jimmy Johnson</a> was working part time at Tune Town, and had agreed to 'work the board' and engineer Norala's sessions on the primitive equipment Ivy had assembled. They worked and re-worked the song the Esquires had brought them in the fall of 1965, using studio musicians who were 'moonlighting' from Fame. The version they eventually brought to Rick Hall would feature <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/oldhams.htm">Spooner Oldham</a> on the Farfisa, <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hawkinsr.htm">Roger Hawkins</a> on drums and <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/lowejr.htm">Junior Lowe </a>on the bass along with Marlin Greene on guitar. As soon as Hall heard it, he knew it was a hit, and called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Wexler">Jerry Wexler</a> at Atlantic. Although Wexler was skeptical at first, Rick assured him that he felt "strong as death" that the song would be a #1 record.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/696589/Quin%20Wex.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/298210/Quin%20Wex.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He was right, of course. Wexler had worked out a deal with Ivy to lease the single (a deal that would include a 2% 'finders fee' for Rick Hall), but he wanted him to re-cut it, and clean it up a little. Happy to have landed a deal with a major label, Quin set to work polishing the track, making sure to fix the off-key horn section, and Percy's painfully out of tune vocals. He sent the new master off to New York, and Atlantic released <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880831">When A Man Loves a Woman</a> in April of 1966. It would quickly soar to #1 on both the R&B and pop charts, and was just an absolute monster. Much to Ivy's amazement, the big company had used the original version by mistake! <br /><br />It's hard to overstate the incredible power of this song that came up out of the woods of Alabama and somehow slowed everything down, defining the meaning of romance for an entire generation in the process. It still gives me chills.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/889373/Quin%20Percy.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/712719/Quin%20Percy.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Percy Sledge had put Muscle Shoals on the map, and his brand of deep southern soul along with it. Sledge's follow up record, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880839">Warm And Tender Love</a> (the <a href="http://souldetective.blogspot.com/2006/04/case-one-joe-haywood.html">Joe Haywood</a> song reportedly pitched to Wexler by <a href="http://souldetective.blogspot.com/2006/04/case-one-joe-haywood.html">Bobby Robinson</a> backstage at the Apollo), would hit #5 R&B (#17 pop) despite Ivy's 'Mr. Whitebread' production. Incredibly, it was recorded at the same Norala session as all time Penn-Oldham classic <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880841">It Tears Me Up</a> in May of 1966, while <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880831">When A Man Loves a Woman</a> was still topping the charts. <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/516502/Richard_%26_Otis.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/18537/Richard_%26_Otis.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Needless to say, Sledge had gone from hospital orderly and weekend warrior to the big time in about six months. Second only to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding">Otis Redding</a> in this poster at left, it must have been quite an adjustment. Suffering from 'nervous exhaustion,' Sledge reportedly checked himself in to the hospital where he used to work for a week in late 1966. Singles like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880847">Baby Help Me</a> and Penn-Oldham's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880851">Out Of Left Field</a> barely made the R&B top 40 in early 1967 and, as is often the case, Percy was having trouble duplicating his initial big smash.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/106685/Tony_Borders2.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/591458/Tony_Borders2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Ivy was able to build a new facility by then, however, and opened Quinvy Studios across town on Broadway in Sheffield. He would soon create his own labels as well, and great records by local talent like <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/T/tony_borders.htm">Tony Borders</a> and <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/B/bill_brandon.htm">Bill Brandon</a> were released on his Quinvy and South Camp imprints. They remain some of the rarest, and best, of the Muscle Shoals 45s of the late sixties (if you can find them!).<br /><br />Percy was back in the top ten with the fantastic <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880861">Take Time To Know Her</a> in the spring of 1968, and continued to tour constantly. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880863">Sudden Stop</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880869">My Special Prayer</a> would hover around the top 40 later that year.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/177972/Album%20From%20Elvis%20in%20Memphis.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/604146/Album%20From%20Elvis%20in%20Memphis.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>In early 1969, RCA booked <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/elvis/elvishom.html">Elvis</a> into <a href="http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ChipsMoman.html">Chips Moman</a>'s (and Dan Penn's) American Studios in Memphis. American was in the middle of an incredible run of hits (like <a href="http://www.boxtops.com/45cry.htm">Cry Like A Baby</a>) at that point, and RCA was trying to 'capture lightning in a bottle' and revitalize the King's sagging career. The album they came up with is an absolute classic, with 'country soul' songs like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=115829080&s=143441&i=115828026">Suspicious Minds</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=560163&s=143441&i=560019">In The Ghetto</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=260296&s=143441&i=260250">Kentucky Rain</a> becoming huge chart hits. The industry, of course, took notice, and Presley's 'comeback' had begun.<br /><br />Quin Ivy apparently took notice as well. He had made the top 40 with Sledge's syrupy version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=721338&s=143441&i=721318">Love Me Tender</a> in 1967, and figured if it was 'country soul' the people wanted, who better to give it to them than the man who helped invent it! Sledge covered <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=489663&s=143441&i=489620">Any Day Now</a> (as Presley had done on the album), and broke the top 40 for Atlantic again in April of 1969. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=253162&s=143441&i=253108">True Love Travels On A Gravel Road</a> was written by 'Music Row' giants <a href="http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/frazier.html">Dallas Frazier</a> and <a href="http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/owens.html">'Doodle' Owens</a> and included on the Presley album. Ivy apparently recorded Percy's remarkable version we have here today in September of that year. It was released as the flip of <a href="http://www.sonicrec.com/sonicrec.asp?stockno=%20502226">Faithful And True</a>, a Dan Penn-Marlin Greene slow dance, and may well have been the B side, as the romantic ballad was viewed as Percy's 'bread and butter'.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/741132/eddieh18.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/231801/eddieh18.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I've long suspected that the positively awesome lead guitar on here is furnished by the great <a href="http://www.great-music.net/hinton.html">Eddie Hinton</a>, and <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MIGHTYFIELDofVISION/message/75818">Bruce Schurman</a> has confirmed for us over on the <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MIGHTYFIELDofVISION/message/75818">Mighty Field Of Vision</a> Group that Hinton did play on the session along with Marlin Greene. He's not sure who takes the lead, however. In any event, neither side of the record even dented the charts. Changing times, along with Atlantic's declining interest in their R&B artists, may have contributed to that. I don't know. All I can say, once again, is how much this record continues to floor me. Boy, is it good.<br /><br />Quin Ivy walked away from the whole thing in 1970, and went on to become a professor of Business Administration back in Mississippi.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/783999/d57636f073b.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/716468/d57636f073b.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Although nothing much was happening, Sledge hung in there with Atlantic until 1973 when a song called <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/PERCY-SLEDGE-Sunshine-Unchanging-Love_W0QQitemZ4728039954QQcmdZViewItem">Sunshine</a> barely made the charts. He signed with manager <a href="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A66061&comments=yes">Phil Walden</a>'s Capricorn label the following year. Through a 'special arrangement' with Walden, the Ivy produced <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=5245189&s=143441&i=5245179">I'll Be Your Everything</a> put Percy back in the R&B top 20 in late 1974. Disco was rearing its ugly head by then, and Sledge's charting days were soon over. <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/450070/Percy%20Sledge%20Pic%203.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/342074/Percy%20Sledge%20Pic%203.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Percy Sledge has continued working, however, and still performs over 100 shows a year all over the world. He remains one of the most loved performers of all time, and never fails to emotionally connect with his audience.<br /><br />There was a lot of grumbling last year when he was inducted into the silly <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=2347">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>. People were actually saying that he was nothing more than a 'one hit wonder' who didn't deserve to be in there. Can you imagine?<br /><br /> As far as I'm concerned, Percy Sledge is a national treasure... <a href ="http://www.amazon.com/Tears-Me-Up-Percy-Sledge/dp/B0000032DQ">Bless his Sweet Little Soul</a>!<br /><br /><i>...May He Rest In Peace!</i>";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2015/04/percy-sledge-true-love-travels-on.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (Red Kelly)";s:7:"summary";s:19527:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QpibvbfMdCA/VS12OwJGK6I/AAAAAAAAJ1Q/iowVCHTRgbI/s1600/percy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QpibvbfMdCA/VS12OwJGK6I/AAAAAAAAJ1Q/iowVCHTRgbI/s320/percy.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-97_SH-_pLyE/VS1yva60sxI/AAAAAAAAJ08/7qmLoc732kc/s1600/sledgerip.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-97_SH-_pLyE/VS1yva60sxI/AAAAAAAAJ08/7qmLoc732kc/s320/sledgerip.jpg"></a></div>I just heard that yet another Southern Soul legend has gone on. A much-loved figure throughout his long career, his warmth and love of the music shone through every note that Percy Sledge sang...<br /><br />Here's an appreciation of Percy I wrote back in 2006:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/765481/ATLANTIC%202679.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/650767/ATLANTIC%202679.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P30916c42851b2fd6a51e314fa32faf89Z1x4R1REY2V3&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P30916c42851b2fd6a51e314fa32faf89Z1x4R1REY2V3.mp3">True Love Travels On A Gravel Road</a><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/680492/percy_sledge.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/700246/percy_sledge.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Today's selection presented me with a bit of a problem. I had found it listed as both an <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/percy.htm">A side</a> and a <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/psledge.htm">B side</a>, and was counting on the Atlantic discography at Global Dog to be the tiebreaker... only they seem to now be <a href="http://www.globaldogproductions.com/atlantic.html">toast</a> [Ed. Note: as of 1/7 <a href="http://www.globaldogproductions.com/atlantic.html">Global Dog</a> appears to be back in business. The verdict? - B side!]. In any event, this song you're listening to now is, in my opinion, the best (OK-second best) thing <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/sledgep.htm">Percy Sledge</a> ever recorded, and one of my favorite soul songs by anybody ever.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/44135/shadows.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/570887/shadows.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I first heard it when Peter Guralnick included it as the opening track on the companion CD to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Soul-Music-Southern-Freedom/dp/0316332739">Sweet Soul Music</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000002LR9/ref=dp_olp_2/002-4596516-8675245">Voices From The Shadows</a>, in 1992. As many of you know, this was right around the time my wife and I got engaged. The song was high in the rotation in those days, and still does either one of us in... I have yet to listen to it all the way through without jumping out of the ol' chair and singing along with a lump in my throat. I know, I'm a sap. <br /><br />For whatever reason, this song doesn't seem to get any press whatsoever. The silly album reviews of Percy's various greatest hits CDs in places like the 'all' music guide fail to even mention it. Who knows why. B side or not, I wanted to kinda wind down this year's posts with one of my true desert island 45s...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/783971/FAME%206401%20B.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/592723/FAME%206401%20B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lyavqj3yojaa~T1">Quin Ivy</a> is yet another of those southern white boys who grew up listening to John R and Hoss Allen over WLAC. He fell in love with the music, and before long was emulating his heroes spinning R&B records as a dee-jay on his hometown radio station in Oxford, Mississippi. He moved on to WMPS in Memphis before landing a job on WLAY in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in the early sixties. Like everyone else in town back then, he got caught up in the 'songwriting fever' that was going around, and began writing lyrics for a young <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hallrick.htm">Rick Hall</a>. Ivy was Hall's co-writer on two early <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Jimmy Hughes</a> recordings, <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">I'm Qualified</a> and <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Lolly Pops, Lace And Lipstick</a>, the B side of Fame's first release, top 20 R&B hit <a href="http://www.melingo.com/thesoulnet/hughes.htm">Steal Away</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/267039/marlingreene.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/138715/marlingreene.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Quin opened a record store in Sheffield called Tune Town, and watched as Rick's new Fame studio grew. Fame soon had more business than it could handle, and Ivy approached Hall with an idea; what if he were to open his own small studio to record the people Hall was turning away? Rick was all for it, and Ivy opened his Norala (presumably Northern Alabama) studio across the street from Tune Town in late 1965. He had initially asked Rick to let him hire <a href="http://www.boxtops.com/btpenn.htm">Dan Penn</a> as his engineer, but he turned him down and introduced him to local guitarist <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/hideki_wtnb/marlingreene.html">Marlin Greene</a> instead. The two became fast friends, and Ivy soon gave him a percentage of the business.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/799876/P02581XM625.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/821606/P02581XM625.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Although there appears to be several versions of the story, this is basically what happened next; Jimmy Hughes' cousin was an orderly at Colbert County Hospital, and had begun singing with a local combo called the Esquires nights and weekends. The band was working the same fraternity circuit that the Fairlanes and the Mark Vs had done a few short years before. Percy Sledge and fellow Esquires Calvin Lewis and Andrew Wright had come up with a song that they thought could be a hit. They loaded Wright's Hammond B3 into the back of a pickup and hauled it down to Fame. Dan Penn recorded the tune, and pleaded with Hall for a chance to produce them. Rick flatly refused, and Dan sent them over to see Ivy at Norala.<br /><br /> <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/173335/percy%20live.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/740069/percy%20live.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://www.jimmyjohnsonmusic.com/">Jimmy Johnson</a> was working part time at Tune Town, and had agreed to 'work the board' and engineer Norala's sessions on the primitive equipment Ivy had assembled. They worked and re-worked the song the Esquires had brought them in the fall of 1965, using studio musicians who were 'moonlighting' from Fame. The version they eventually brought to Rick Hall would feature <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/oldhams.htm">Spooner Oldham</a> on the Farfisa, <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/hawkinsr.htm">Roger Hawkins</a> on drums and <a href="http://www.alamhof.org/lowejr.htm">Junior Lowe </a>on the bass along with Marlin Greene on guitar. As soon as Hall heard it, he knew it was a hit, and called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Wexler">Jerry Wexler</a> at Atlantic. Although Wexler was skeptical at first, Rick assured him that he felt "strong as death" that the song would be a #1 record.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/696589/Quin%20Wex.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/298210/Quin%20Wex.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He was right, of course.

Happy to have landed a deal with a major label, Quin set to work polishing the track, making sure to fix the off-key horn section, and Percy's painfully out of tune vocals.

Incredibly, it was recorded at the same Norala session as all time Penn-Oldham classic <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880841">It Tears Me Up</a> in May of 1966, while <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880831">When A Man Loves a Woman</a> was still topping the charts. <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/516502/Richard_%26_Otis.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/18537/Richard_%26_Otis.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Needless to say, Sledge had gone from hospital orderly and weekend warrior to the big time in about six months. Second only to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding">Otis Redding</a> in this poster at left, it must have been quite an adjustment. Suffering from 'nervous exhaustion,' Sledge reportedly checked himself in to the hospital where he used to work for a week in late 1966. Singles like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880847">Baby Help Me</a> and Penn-Oldham's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880851">Out Of Left Field</a> barely made the R&B top 40 in early 1967 and, as is often the case, Percy was having trouble duplicating his initial big smash.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/106685/Tony_Borders2.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/591458/Tony_Borders2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Ivy was able to build a new facility by then, however, and opened Quinvy Studios across town on Broadway in Sheffield. He would soon create his own labels as well, and great records by local talent like <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/T/tony_borders.htm">Tony Borders</a> and <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists/B/bill_brandon.htm">Bill Brandon</a> were released on his Quinvy and South Camp imprints. They remain some of the rarest, and best, of the Muscle Shoals 45s of the late sixties (if you can find them!).<br /><br />Percy was back in the top ten with the fantastic <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880861">Take Time To Know Her</a> in the spring of 1968, and continued to tour constantly. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880863">Sudden Stop</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=880871&s=143441&i=880869">My Special Prayer</a> would hover around the top 40 later that year.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/177972/Album%20From%20Elvis%20in%20Memphis.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/604146/Album%20From%20Elvis%20in%20Memphis.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>In early 1969, RCA booked <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/elvis/elvishom.html">Elvis</a> into <a href="http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ChipsMoman.html">Chips Moman</a>'s (and Dan Penn's) American Studios in Memphis. American was in the middle of an incredible run of hits (like <a href="http://www.boxtops.com/45cry.htm">Cry Like A Baby</a>) at that point, and RCA was trying to 'capture lightning in a bottle' and revitalize the King's sagging career. The album they came up with is an absolute classic, with 'country soul' songs like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=115829080&s=143441&i=115828026">Suspicious Minds</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=560163&s=143441&i=560019">In The Ghetto</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=260296&s=143441&i=260250">Kentucky Rain</a> becoming huge chart hits. The industry, of course, took notice, and Presley's 'comeback' had begun.<br /><br />Quin Ivy apparently took notice as well. He had made the top 40 with Sledge's syrupy version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=721338&s=143441&i=721318">Love Me Tender</a> in 1967, and figured if it was 'country soul' the people wanted, who better to give it to them than the man who helped invent it! Sledge covered <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=489663&s=143441&i=489620">Any Day Now</a> (as Presley had done on the album), and broke the top 40 for Atlantic again in April of 1969. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=253162&s=143441&i=253108">True Love Travels On A Gravel Road</a> was written by 'Music Row' giants <a href="http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/frazier.html">Dallas Frazier</a> and <a href="http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/owens.html">'Doodle' Owens</a> and included on the Presley album. Ivy apparently recorded Percy's remarkable version we have here today in September of that year. It was released as the flip of <a href="http://www.sonicrec.com/sonicrec.asp?stockno=%20502226">Faithful And True</a>, a Dan Penn-Marlin Greene slow dance, and may well have been the B side, as the romantic ballad was viewed as Percy's 'bread and butter'.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/741132/eddieh18.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/231801/eddieh18.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I've long suspected that the positively awesome lead guitar on here is furnished by the great <a href="http://www.great-music.net/hinton.html">Eddie Hinton</a>, and <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MIGHTYFIELDofVISION/message/75818">Bruce Schurman</a> has confirmed for us over on the <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MIGHTYFIELDofVISION/message/75818">Mighty Field Of Vision</a> Group that Hinton did play on the session along with Marlin Greene. He's not sure who takes the lead, however. In any event, neither side of the record even dented the charts. Changing times, along with Atlantic's declining interest in their R&B artists, may have contributed to that. I don't know. All I can say, once again, is how much this record continues to floor me. Boy, is it good.<br /><br />Quin Ivy walked away from the whole thing in 1970, and went on to become a professor of Business Administration back in Mississippi.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/783999/d57636f073b.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/716468/d57636f073b.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Although nothing much was happening, Sledge hung in there with Atlantic until 1973 when a song called <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/PERCY-SLEDGE-Sunshine-Unchanging-Love_W0QQitemZ4728039954QQcmdZViewItem">Sunshine</a> barely made the charts. He signed with manager <a href="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A66061&comments=yes">Phil Walden</a>'s Capricorn label the following year. Through a 'special arrangement' with Walden, the Ivy produced <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=5245189&s=143441&i=5245179">I'll Be Your Everything</a> put Percy back in the R&B top 20 in late 1974. Disco was rearing its ugly head by then, and Sledge's charting days were soon over. <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/450070/Percy%20Sledge%20Pic%203.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/342074/Percy%20Sledge%20Pic%203.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Percy Sledge has continued working, however, and still performs over 100 shows a year all over the world. He remains one of the most loved performers of all time, and never fails to emotionally connect with his audience.<br /><br />There was a lot of grumbling last year when he was inducted into the silly <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=2347">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>. People were actually saying that he was nothing more than a 'one hit wonder' who didn't deserve to be in there.

Blaze Records credited him as Don "Pretty Boy" Covay, while on his subsequent <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/sue.htm">Sue</a> effort, he's simply Don Covay.<br /><br />To confuse matters further, Firefly listed him as 'Don Covay of the Rainbows', while on Big Records he was back to being known simply as 'Pretty Boy'. In any event, none of these records went anywhere. <br /><br />He signed with Columbia in 1961, recording another trio of singles that died on the vine, before becoming one of <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/scepter/scepterstory.html">Florence Greenberg</a>'s <b>Soldier Boys</b> on <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/scepter/scepterstory.html">Scepter</a>.

Covay knew the type of singer that Solomon was, and was able to tailor the follow-up record to his 1962 smash <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995624">Cry To Me</a>, specifically to him. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995645">I'm Hanging Up My Heart For You</a> remains one of Burke's all-time classics, and marks the beginning of a life-long friendship and collaboration that would send songs like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995658">You're Good For Me</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995781">Tonight's The Night</a> soaring into the top ten over the next few years.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOGMXiuLoI/AAAAAAAAAtc/FHJlFDaF3Zg/s1600-h/ROSEMART+802.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOGMXiuLoI/AAAAAAAAAtc/FHJlFDaF3Zg/s200/ROSEMART+802.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054030753876029058"></a>I'm not sure why, but Atlantic was releasing Covay's own singles on a subsidiary label called <b>Rosemart</b> at that point (I've never seen records by any other artist on that imprint. have you?). <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=74705960&s=143441&i=74705704">Mercy, Mercy</a> would crack the R&B top 40 in the fall of 1964, and essentially define Covay's own brand of funky guitar-driven R&B. There has been much speculation over the years about whether or not <a href="http://www.earlyhendrix.com/artists/covay/index.htm">Jimi Hendrix</a> played on that record (and Covay's next Rosemart release <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=74705960&s=143441&i=74705853">Take This Hurt Off Me</a>), but there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer. One thing appears to be certain, that Covay (who wrote using the guitar instead of piano) <i>is</i> playing on those cuts. I like that.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOJmHiuLpI/AAAAAAAAAtk/Xfm5Vs8otWY/s1600-h/MERCY!.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOJmHiuLpI/AAAAAAAAAtk/Xfm5Vs8otWY/s200/MERCY!.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054034494792543890"></a>Atlantic collected those singles, along with other material cut at their New York studios in 1964, and released Covay's first LP, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=74705960&s=143441">Mercy!</a>. In an interesting aside, Don had been using the name 'The Goodtimers' off and on since the first release of Pony Time in 1961. The name appears on the Rosemart singles, as well as on his Atlantic releases (like today's selection) until 1967. It apparently refers to the vocal group that backs him up on those records (sometimes, however, it sounds like only one other voice), but I can't for the life of me find out any information on who they might be. It seems possible that it was just Covay overdubbing a second harmony vocal (as was all the rage back then) but I don't know... In any event, his next single, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=40284771&s=143441&i=40284788">Please Do Something</a>, (featuring The Goodtimers, of course) went to #21 R&B in early 1965, becoming his biggest hit yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOPPHiuLqI/AAAAAAAAAts/2CMwBdBhepA/s1600-h/DC+STAX.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOPPHiuLqI/AAAAAAAAAts/2CMwBdBhepA/s200/DC+STAX.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054040696725319330"></a>That was the summer that Wexler brought <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">Wilson Pickett</a> down to Stax to record his blockbuster hits <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=14750874&s=143441&i=14750878">In The Midnight Hour</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719988">634-5789</a>, and he figured it made sense to do the same with Don Covay. Just as Pickett had done, Covay collaborated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cropper">Steve Cropper</a> to write the biggest-selling record of his career, the incredible <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159364059&s=143441&i=159364061">See-Saw</a>. It would spend almost four months on the charts, reaching #5 R&B and almost cracking the top 40 Pop (As good as this record was, I'm here to tell ya that the incendiary version that Aretha would take to the top ten in late 1968 is better... just ask <a href="http://funky16corners.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/aretha-franklin-see-saw/">Larry Grogan</a>).<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOVbHiuLrI/AAAAAAAAAt0/oiN6PrHYF3o/s1600-h/covay_don~~_seesaw~~~_102b.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOVbHiuLrI/AAAAAAAAAt0/oiN6PrHYF3o/s200/covay_don~~_seesaw~~~_102b.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054047499953516210"></a>All in all, Covay recorded four sides at Stax (one of which was the amazing <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159364059&s=143441&i=159364080">Sookie Sookie</a>) before things got a little rough. According to Cropper; "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Stewart_%28music%29">Jim Stewart</a> called Jerry Wexler and said 'Get Don Covay out of here. He's driving us nuts!'... I loved Don to death. We got along great, but I don't think Jim and them understood Don. He thinks in different areas... He jumps from this place to that. You never know what he's going to do next." Stewart used that, along with the house band's supposed dislike of Wilson Pickett, to bar Atlantic from sending any more of their artists down there in December of 1965.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOZe3iuLsI/AAAAAAAAAt8/Tf6-UXmkpi4/s1600-h/Vee+Jay+698.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOZe3iuLsI/AAAAAAAAAt8/Tf6-UXmkpi4/s200/Vee+Jay+698.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054051962424536770"></a>As we talked about <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-richard-i-dont-know-what-youve.html">last week</a>, this was the same period in which Covay wrote (and sang on) <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-richard-i-dont-know-what-youve.html">I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)</a> for his old friend Little Richard. As B side regular Lyle pointed out in the 'comments' on that post, Guralnick called that song "arguably equal to James Carr's <a href="http://funky16corners.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/james-carr-the-dark-end-of-the-street/">The Dark End of the Street</a> as the greatest soul ballad of all time... the Mt.

The flip of <b>Somebody's Got To Love You</b> (which didn't chart either), I think it has the same kind of vibe going on as the Little Richard record.  With Atlantic's 'A team' (including <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/03/king-curtis-kingpins-8th-wonder-atco.html">King Curtis</a> and <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/bernard-pretty-purdie">Bernard Purdie</a>) backing him up, I just love the way Covay name checks the whole Soul Clan on here, almost two years before the release of their lone single. You know, it's been commonly thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_E._King">Ben E. King</a> was a last minute replacement for Wilson Pickett after he balked at the idea of being a member, but this way cool record would seem to prove otherwise... Don had him on the list all along!<br /><br />He would return to the R&B top 50 with <b>Shingaling '67</b>, and In August of that year, Atlantic sent Covay down to American Studios in Memphis to record another unacknowledged soul masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mercy-Definitive-Don-Covay/dp/samples/B000002Z8M/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/102-1963504-1676928?ie=UTF8&qid=1176760242&sr=8-1#disc_1">It's In The Wind</a>, one of my favorite records ever. <br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOh-niuLvI/AAAAAAAAAuU/BffuNn_QOCU/s1600-h/DC+Ertegun.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOh-niuLvI/AAAAAAAAAuU/BffuNn_QOCU/s200/DC+Ertegun.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054061303978405618"></a>Covay was every record company executive's dream, a staff songwriter who could deliver the hits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Chess">Leonard Chess</a> had begun using some of his material (think <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/04/etta-james-im-gonna-take-what-hes-got.html">Etta James</a>), but in late 1967, Atlantic would record what remains his best known work, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/11/aretha-franklin-baby-baby-baby.html">Aretha Franklin</a>'s <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=15032686&s=143441&i=15032688">Chain Of Fools</a>.

He was the one spinning the elaborate aspirations, daring to imagine a world in which Black Americans could control their own destinies. According to Solomon Burke, they had initially asked Atlantic for a million dollar guarantee up front, and the project was to include a complete album of material. The Clan was reportedly waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding">Otis Redding</a> to fully recover from minor throat surgery when he died in that infamous plane crash in December of 1967. Covay, more than ever now, was committed to making his dream come true. He wrote and recorded the basic tracks of the single out in Hollywood with (an uncredited) <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/bobby-womack-of-valentinos-lonesome.html">Bobby Womack</a>, and the rest of the Clan overdubbed their vocals as their schedule permitted. Arthur Conley, of course, would replace Otis, and <a href="http://funky16corners.blogspot.com/2006/04/soul-clan-soul-meeting-and-some-more.html">Soul Meeting</a> broke into the R&B top 40 in the summer of 1968. Although a great record, the Soul Clan's moment seemed to somehow already have passed. Whether it was due to a conscious decision on the part of the Atlantic brass (as Covay and Solomon Burke believe to this day) or not, that would be the end of that.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiPDtHiuLxI/AAAAAAAAAuk/vtPyc68aJ-U/s1600-h/House+of+Blue+Lights.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiPDtHiuLxI/AAAAAAAAAuk/vtPyc68aJ-U/s200/House+of+Blue+Lights.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054098386726039314"></a>As the decade came to a close, Covay would start up another project, <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/house-of-blue-light">The Jefferson Lemon Blues Band</a>. Along with <a href="http://www.wirz.de/music/hammofrm.htm">John Hammond</a> and <b>Joe Richardson</b> (whom Covay had worked with in The Soldier Boys), he created a very cool concept album called <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/house-of-blue-light">The House Of Blue Lights</a>.

In any event, Covay still believed. As he told Guralnick; "The Soul Clan was to me the greatest thing that ever happened. I think the kind of love we had was an everlasting situation. If any of us ever need each other, you know we gonna be there."<br /><br />In 1990, I went to the Lone Star Roadhouse in Manhattan to see a <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/booker_t_and_the_mgs.htm">Booker T & the MGs</a> reunion show at which <a href="http://www.tsimon.com/floyd.htm">Eddie Floyd</a> was a special guest. I was seated at a table with a big guy in a pink suit and beaded corn-rows ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>. I knew he had to be 'somebody', but I wasn't sure who. When Steve Cropper introduced him to the audience, I found out I was sitting with Don Covay. Unreal.

Blaze Records credited him as Don "Pretty Boy" Covay, while on his subsequent <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/sue.htm">Sue</a> effort, he's simply Don Covay.<br /><br />To confuse matters further, Firefly listed him as 'Don Covay of the Rainbows', while on Big Records he was back to being known simply as 'Pretty Boy'. In any event, none of these records went anywhere. <br /><br />He signed with Columbia in 1961, recording another trio of singles that died on the vine, before becoming one of <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/scepter/scepterstory.html">Florence Greenberg</a>'s <b>Soldier Boys</b> on <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/scepter/scepterstory.html">Scepter</a>.

When <a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/philadelphia/parkway.html">Parkway Records</a> released <a href="http://www.chubbychecker.com/bio.asp">Chubby Checker</a>'s version of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=82116296&s=143441&i=82116334">Pony Time</a>  in early 1961, it would blow by Covay's, going all the way to #1 both R&B and Pop on its way to becoming an even bigger hit than <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=77684991&s=143441&i=77685195">The Twist</a> had been a couple of years earlier.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bsnpubs.com/philadelphia/camparkstory.html">Cameo</a> (Parkway's parent company) signed Covay to the label the following year, and would try to cash in on yet another dance craze, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/05/eddie-bo-now-lets-popeye-part-ii-ric.html">The Popeye</a>. While Checker's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=82116296&s=143441&i=82116373">Popeye (The Hitchiker)</a> broke into the top ten,  the single they released on Covay barely crawled to #75. It was called <b>The Popeye Waddle</b> and, despite a catchy <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/contours.htm">Contours</a> like number that promised 'you'll do fine if you get in line', it failed to catch on. The flip of that single, <b>One Little Boy Had Money</b>, hinted at the vocal style that was to come. Something called <b>Do The Bug</b> would follow, along with two Parkway singles that went nowhere.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiN29niuLlI/AAAAAAAAAtE/unxk_VJZJiU/s1600-h/HeyLoverlyrics.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiN29niuLlI/AAAAAAAAAtE/unxk_VJZJiU/s200/HeyLoverlyrics.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054014007798541906"></a>The success of Pony Time, I'm sure, helped convince Don that his songwriting skills were in demand  (as he would later explain to author <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nowhere-Run-Gerri-Hirshey/dp/1904915108/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1963504-1676928?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176761397&sr=8-1">Gerri Hirshey</a>, "copyrights last longer than record labels"), and he moved to New York City.

Covay knew the type of singer that Solomon was, and was able to tailor the follow-up record to his 1962 smash <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995624">Cry To Me</a>, specifically to him. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995645">I'm Hanging Up My Heart For You</a> remains one of Burke's all-time classics, and marks the beginning of a life-long friendship and collaboration that would send songs like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995658">You're Good For Me</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=79995839&s=143441&i=79995781">Tonight's The Night</a> soaring into the top ten over the next few years.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOGMXiuLoI/AAAAAAAAAtc/FHJlFDaF3Zg/s1600-h/ROSEMART+802.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOGMXiuLoI/AAAAAAAAAtc/FHJlFDaF3Zg/s200/ROSEMART+802.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054030753876029058"></a>I'm not sure why, but Atlantic was releasing Covay's own singles on a subsidiary label called <b>Rosemart</b> at that point (I've never seen records by any other artist on that imprint. have you?). <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=74705960&s=143441&i=74705704">Mercy, Mercy</a> would crack the R&B top 40 in the fall of 1964, and essentially define Covay's own brand of funky guitar-driven R&B. There has been much speculation over the years about whether or not <a href="http://www.earlyhendrix.com/artists/covay/index.htm">Jimi Hendrix</a> played on that record (and Covay's next Rosemart release <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=74705960&s=143441&i=74705853">Take This Hurt Off Me</a>), but there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer. One thing appears to be certain, that Covay (who wrote using the guitar instead of piano) <i>is</i> playing on those cuts. I like that.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOJmHiuLpI/AAAAAAAAAtk/Xfm5Vs8otWY/s1600-h/MERCY!.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOJmHiuLpI/AAAAAAAAAtk/Xfm5Vs8otWY/s200/MERCY!.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054034494792543890"></a>Atlantic collected those singles, along with other material cut at their New York studios in 1964, and released Covay's first LP, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=74705960&s=143441">Mercy!</a>. In an interesting aside, Don had been using the name 'The Goodtimers' off and on since the first release of Pony Time in 1961. The name appears on the Rosemart singles, as well as on his Atlantic releases (like today's selection) until 1967. It apparently refers to the vocal group that backs him up on those records (sometimes, however, it sounds like only one other voice), but I can't for the life of me find out any information on who they might be. It seems possible that it was just Covay overdubbing a second harmony vocal (as was all the rage back then) but I don't know... In any event, his next single, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=40284771&s=143441&i=40284788">Please Do Something</a>, (featuring The Goodtimers, of course) went to #21 R&B in early 1965, becoming his biggest hit yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOPPHiuLqI/AAAAAAAAAts/2CMwBdBhepA/s1600-h/DC+STAX.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOPPHiuLqI/AAAAAAAAAts/2CMwBdBhepA/s200/DC+STAX.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054040696725319330"></a>That was the summer that Wexler brought <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">Wilson Pickett</a> down to Stax to record his blockbuster hits <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=14750874&s=143441&i=14750878">In The Midnight Hour</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719988">634-5789</a>, and he figured it made sense to do the same with Don Covay. Just as Pickett had done, Covay collaborated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cropper">Steve Cropper</a> to write the biggest-selling record of his career, the incredible <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159364059&s=143441&i=159364061">See-Saw</a>. It would spend almost four months on the charts, reaching #5 R&B and almost cracking the top 40 Pop (As good as this record was, I'm here to tell ya that the incendiary version that Aretha would take to the top ten in late 1968 is better... just ask <a href="http://funky16corners.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/aretha-franklin-see-saw/">Larry Grogan</a>).<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOVbHiuLrI/AAAAAAAAAt0/oiN6PrHYF3o/s1600-h/covay_don~~_seesaw~~~_102b.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOVbHiuLrI/AAAAAAAAAt0/oiN6PrHYF3o/s200/covay_don~~_seesaw~~~_102b.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054047499953516210"></a>All in all, Covay recorded four sides at Stax (one of which was the amazing <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159364059&s=143441&i=159364080">Sookie Sookie</a>) before things got a little rough. According to Cropper; "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Stewart_%28music%29">Jim Stewart</a> called Jerry Wexler and said 'Get Don Covay out of here. He's driving us nuts!'... I loved Don to death. We got along great, but I don't think Jim and them understood Don. He thinks in different areas... He jumps from this place to that. You never know what he's going to do next." Stewart used that, along with the house band's supposed dislike of Wilson Pickett, to bar Atlantic from sending any more of their artists down there in December of 1965.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOZe3iuLsI/AAAAAAAAAt8/Tf6-UXmkpi4/s1600-h/Vee+Jay+698.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOZe3iuLsI/AAAAAAAAAt8/Tf6-UXmkpi4/s200/Vee+Jay+698.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054051962424536770"></a>As we talked about <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-richard-i-dont-know-what-youve.html">last week</a>, this was the same period in which Covay wrote (and sang on) <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-richard-i-dont-know-what-youve.html">I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)</a> for his old friend Little Richard. As B side regular Lyle pointed out in the 'comments' on that post, Guralnick called that song "arguably equal to James Carr's <a href="http://funky16corners.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/james-carr-the-dark-end-of-the-street/">The Dark End of the Street</a> as the greatest soul ballad of all time... the Mt.

I will second Lyle's "Amen" to that.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOeSHiuLuI/AAAAAAAAAuM/ofrQvAI-Pic/s1600-h/ATLANTIC+2537A.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOeSHiuLuI/AAAAAAAAAuM/ofrQvAI-Pic/s200/ATLANTIC+2537A.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054057240939343586"></a>After both <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=159364059&s=143441&i=159364080">Sookie Sookie</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=40284771&s=143441&i=40284786">Iron Out The Rough Spots</a> (the last of the Stax-recorded material) failed to chart in 1966, Atlantic brought Covay back into its New York studios to record today's cool B side. The flip of <b>Somebody's Got To Love You</b> (which didn't chart either), I think it has the same kind of vibe going on as the Little Richard record.  With Atlantic's 'A team' (including <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/03/king-curtis-kingpins-8th-wonder-atco.html">King Curtis</a> and <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/bernard-pretty-purdie">Bernard Purdie</a>) backing him up, I just love the way Covay name checks the whole Soul Clan on here, almost two years before the release of their lone single. You know, it's been commonly thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_E._King">Ben E. King</a> was a last minute replacement for Wilson Pickett after he balked at the idea of being a member, but this way cool record would seem to prove otherwise... Don had him on the list all along!<br /><br />He would return to the R&B top 50 with <b>Shingaling '67</b>, and In August of that year, Atlantic sent Covay down to American Studios in Memphis to record another unacknowledged soul masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mercy-Definitive-Don-Covay/dp/samples/B000002Z8M/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/102-1963504-1676928?ie=UTF8&qid=1176760242&sr=8-1#disc_1">It's In The Wind</a>, one of my favorite records ever. <br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOh-niuLvI/AAAAAAAAAuU/BffuNn_QOCU/s1600-h/DC+Ertegun.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiOh-niuLvI/AAAAAAAAAuU/BffuNn_QOCU/s200/DC+Ertegun.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054061303978405618"></a>Covay was every record company executive's dream, a staff songwriter who could deliver the hits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Chess">Leonard Chess</a> had begun using some of his material (think <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/04/etta-james-im-gonna-take-what-hes-got.html">Etta James</a>), but in late 1967, Atlantic would record what remains his best known work, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/11/aretha-franklin-baby-baby-baby.html">Aretha Franklin</a>'s <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=15032686&s=143441&i=15032688">Chain Of Fools</a>.

He was the one spinning the elaborate aspirations, daring to imagine a world in which Black Americans could control their own destinies. According to Solomon Burke, they had initially asked Atlantic for a million dollar guarantee up front, and the project was to include a complete album of material. The Clan was reportedly waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding">Otis Redding</a> to fully recover from minor throat surgery when he died in that infamous plane crash in December of 1967. Covay, more than ever now, was committed to making his dream come true. He wrote and recorded the basic tracks of the single out in Hollywood with (an uncredited) <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/bobby-womack-of-valentinos-lonesome.html">Bobby Womack</a>, and the rest of the Clan overdubbed their vocals as their schedule permitted. Arthur Conley, of course, would replace Otis, and <a href="http://funky16corners.blogspot.com/2006/04/soul-clan-soul-meeting-and-some-more.html">Soul Meeting</a> broke into the R&B top 40 in the summer of 1968. Although a great record, the Soul Clan's moment seemed to somehow already have passed. Whether it was due to a conscious decision on the part of the Atlantic brass (as Covay and Solomon Burke believe to this day) or not, that would be the end of that.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiPDtHiuLxI/AAAAAAAAAuk/vtPyc68aJ-U/s1600-h/House+of+Blue+Lights.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/RiPDtHiuLxI/AAAAAAAAAuk/vtPyc68aJ-U/s200/House+of+Blue+Lights.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5054098386726039314"></a>As the decade came to a close, Covay would start up another project, <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/house-of-blue-light">The Jefferson Lemon Blues Band</a>. Along with <a href="http://www.wirz.de/music/hammofrm.htm">John Hammond</a> and <b>Joe Richardson</b> (whom Covay had worked with in The Soldier Boys), he created a very cool concept album called <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/house-of-blue-light">The House Of Blue Lights</a>.

In any event, Covay still believed. As he told Guralnick; "The Soul Clan was to me the greatest thing that ever happened. I think the kind of love we had was an everlasting situation. If any of us ever need each other, you know we gonna be there."<br /><br />In 1990, I went to the Lone Star Roadhouse in Manhattan to see a <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/booker_t_and_the_mgs.htm">Booker T & the MGs</a> reunion show at which <a href="http://www.tsimon.com/floyd.htm">Eddie Floyd</a> was a special guest.

Living in 'Bronzeville', he attended grammar school with a kid named Sam Cook. Both of their fathers were preachers, and before long both boys were out there singing in family Gospel groups. LeRoy saved up enough money from his paper route to buy a guitar, and was soon playing it with the group, becoming one of the first to introduce the instrument to Gospel Music.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EbUlnjxMYiA/VKBdRiRJYFI/AAAAAAAAJsU/FeBA2vWmQ5M/s1600/Crume%2BBrothers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EbUlnjxMYiA/VKBdRiRJYFI/AAAAAAAAJsU/FeBA2vWmQ5M/s320/Crume%2BBrothers.jpg"></a></div><br />Sam went on to become somewhat of a teen sensation as the lead singer of the popular  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Highway_Q.C.'s">Highway Q.C.'s</a>, who would develop a friendly rivalry with The Crume Brothers, each trying to 'cut' the other in area appearances. Shortly after founding father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._H._Harris">R.H. Harris</a> left <a href="https://rockhall.com/inductees/the-soul-stirrers/bio/">The Soul Stirrers</a> in 1950, he recruited LeRoy to play guitar for his new group, <a href="http://opalnations.com/files/Harris_Rebert_H_Christland_Singers_Gospel_Paraders.pdf">The Christland Singers</a>. The Soul Stirrers, meanwhile, had chosen Sam to replace the highly regarded Harris, which was considered quite a bold move at the time. As the guitar began to become an essential component of Quartet Gospel (thanks, in large part, to LeRoy), The Stirrers hired a Philadelphian named <a href="http://www.secondhandsongs.com/artist/55619/all">Bob King</a> away from The Southern Tones to accompany them on the road. When King became too ill to travel, Sam convinced the group to ask LeRoy to join them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6VIHdeHPc-A/VKBmYbnXxDI/AAAAAAAAJss/jrjSsHP_ma8/s1600/Soul%2BStirrers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6VIHdeHPc-A/VKBmYbnXxDI/AAAAAAAAJss/jrjSsHP_ma8/s320/Soul%2BStirrers.jpg"></a></div><br />Against his better judgement, Crume left his 'day job' in Chicago and accepted their offer. Two 'young bucks' in what had essentially been an old man's game, the pair soon became inseparable, and their late night exploits raised eyebrows up and down the Gospel Highway.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pPFHu_7u1Rg/VKBsPx8fAsI/AAAAAAAAJs8/5AcQn78h6Pw/s1600/SAR%2B101.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pPFHu_7u1Rg/VKBsPx8fAsI/AAAAAAAAJs8/5AcQn78h6Pw/s200/SAR%2B101.jpg"></a></div>After Cooke 'crossed over' in 1956, Crume became the group's de-facto leader, and it was his closeness with Sam that influenced their decision to sign with his new SAR label, a decision Crume would <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Sam-Superstar-LeRoy-Crume/dp/1493145339">later call</a> <i>"the biggest mistake I would ever make... I allowed friendship to overrule my business sense."</i> Be that as it may, LeRoy remained out there on the road backing up a series of Sam's successors, like Johnny Jones, Johnnie Taylor and the extremely 'bad' Jimmy Outler:<br /><br /><div align="center"><iframe width="400" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VmizCScGLmY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />Just positively amazing stuff, I don't think you can say enough about LeRoy's driving guitar work, and just how great The Stirrers continued to be after Sam departed. He and Leroy remained very close and, in his mind, I don't think Cooke ever really left. <i>"Sam was a Soul Stirrer until the night somebody murdered him,"</i> Leroy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Sam-Superstar-LeRoy-Crume/dp/1493145339">said</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Q15bMqxBZmY/VKCGjCs9oKI/AAAAAAAAJtI/MZUNNULJU7k/s1600/JET641231a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Q15bMqxBZmY/VKCGjCs9oKI/AAAAAAAAJtI/MZUNNULJU7k/s400/JET641231a.jpg"></a></div><i>"Sam was as close as any blood relative I've ever had... me and Sam had that special connection."</i> Heartbroken, Leroy had lost his best friend, and within a few months he quit the group as well. He maintained that there was a lot more to Sam's death than met the eye, and that he was killed for not playing the game the way certain people wanted him to...<br /><br />Leroy eventually wound up back in Chicago where, in addition to getting a job driving a bus for the CTA, he would become a member of the <a href="http://jubileeshowcase.com/">Jubilee Showcase</a> house band. He began performing some secular material with a friend of his from The Clefs of Calvary named Calvin April, and somehow they wound up recording at American for Sound Stage 7 in 1968.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pw4IyicmWgk/VKCgB99Ij9I/AAAAAAAAJtY/1l8I2MclDbg/s1600/SS7%2B2612B.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pw4IyicmWgk/VKCgB99Ij9I/AAAAAAAAJtY/1l8I2MclDbg/s200/SS7%2B2612B.jpg"></a></div><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pc26245c70ce3f4ffd17dd8cb19075af3Z1x4R1REYGt8.mp3">I'm Alright Now</a><br />SS7 2612<br /><i>"We recorded that in Memphis.

The following night after getting back to Chicago, I turned on the TV, and it had just happened.  That's  how I first heard about it... by the way, <b>Soul X 2</b>, was NOT my favorite name, it was given to us by the DJ from, WLAC radio in Nashville, Hoss Allen.

He immediately signed The Staple Singers and hooked up with Jesse Jackson and SCLC compatriot Larry Shaw in Chicago in an effort to keep the label on the cutting edge. While in Chicago, Pervis Staples took him to see 'Father of The Blues' <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/06/willie-dixon-and-allstars-walking-blues.html">Willie Dixon</a> who had recorded a demo he wanted Bell to hear.<br /><br />Willie had written <a href="http://youtu.be/wi7eo-WPKgw">Right Tight and Out of Sight</a> with a soul duo like Sam & Dave in mind. Bell liked the song, but was more interested in signing the guys who were singing it... Leroy and Calvin - now known as Branding Iron.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3L-vLAJ2_pM/VKCudqyU92I/AAAAAAAAJt4/xq2xtM3r0EA/s1600/VOLT%2B4043.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3L-vLAJ2_pM/VKCudqyU92I/AAAAAAAAJt4/xq2xtM3r0EA/s200/VOLT%2B4043.jpg"></a></div>The record began to make some local noise, which led to an appearance on another Chicago institution, <a href="http://soultrain.com/">Soul Train</a>. Things were definitely looking up! The flip of that first Volt release, <a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P1d905d9821a7a218b857e9361634d332Z1x4R1REamZz.mp3">Slave For Love</a> was written by another legendary Blues figure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Lenoir">J.B.

Despite Bell's assurance that <i>"you guys are going to make so much money, you won't be able to count it all!,"</i> the record never made the national charts and, after one more Volt release, they were let go. Although Branding Iron would cut <a href="http://www.45cat.com/record/st10024pl25st10024pl27">another 45</a> for the tiny Stag label (produced by Leroy's brother Dillard), by then he was back on the road with The Soul Stirrers, where he would remain for the rest of his life.<Br /><br /><div align="center"><iframe width="400" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eq3pM9A_-UU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><i>"I thank God for allowing me to hang around as long as I have, after literally taking away all of those that once walked along with me when this journey started... they're all gone.

Sometimes I wonder why was I left as the last Soul Stirrer standing, and then something seems to say, it's not yours to reason why.

LeRoy saved up enough money from his paper route to buy a guitar, and was soon playing it with the group, becoming one of the first to introduce the instrument to Gospel Music.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EbUlnjxMYiA/VKBdRiRJYFI/AAAAAAAAJsU/FeBA2vWmQ5M/s1600/Crume%2BBrothers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EbUlnjxMYiA/VKBdRiRJYFI/AAAAAAAAJsU/FeBA2vWmQ5M/s320/Crume%2BBrothers.jpg"></a></div><br />Sam went on to become somewhat of a teen sensation as the lead singer of the popular  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Highway_Q.C.'s">Highway Q.C.'s</a>, who would develop a friendly rivalry with The Crume Brothers, each trying to 'cut' the other in area appearances. Shortly after founding father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._H._Harris">R.H. Harris</a> left <a href="https://rockhall.com/inductees/the-soul-stirrers/bio/">The Soul Stirrers</a> in 1950, he recruited LeRoy to play guitar for his new group, <a href="http://opalnations.com/files/Harris_Rebert_H_Christland_Singers_Gospel_Paraders.pdf">The Christland Singers</a>. The Soul Stirrers, meanwhile, had chosen Sam to replace the highly regarded Harris, which was considered quite a bold move at the time. As the guitar began to become an essential component of Quartet Gospel (thanks, in large part, to LeRoy), The Stirrers hired a Philadelphian named <a href="http://www.secondhandsongs.com/artist/55619/all">Bob King</a> away from The Southern Tones to accompany them on the road. When King became too ill to travel, Sam convinced the group to ask LeRoy to join them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6VIHdeHPc-A/VKBmYbnXxDI/AAAAAAAAJss/jrjSsHP_ma8/s1600/Soul%2BStirrers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6VIHdeHPc-A/VKBmYbnXxDI/AAAAAAAAJss/jrjSsHP_ma8/s320/Soul%2BStirrers.jpg"></a></div><br />Against his better judgement, Crume left his 'day job' in Chicago and accepted their offer. Two 'young bucks' in what had essentially been an old man's game, the pair soon became inseparable, and their late night exploits raised eyebrows up and down the Gospel Highway.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pPFHu_7u1Rg/VKBsPx8fAsI/AAAAAAAAJs8/5AcQn78h6Pw/s1600/SAR%2B101.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pPFHu_7u1Rg/VKBsPx8fAsI/AAAAAAAAJs8/5AcQn78h6Pw/s200/SAR%2B101.jpg"></a></div>After Cooke 'crossed over' in 1956, Crume became the group's de-facto leader, and it was his closeness with Sam that influenced their decision to sign with his new SAR label, a decision Crume would <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Sam-Superstar-LeRoy-Crume/dp/1493145339">later call</a> <i>"the biggest mistake I would ever make... I allowed friendship to overrule my business sense."</i> Be that as it may, LeRoy remained out there on the road backing up a series of Sam's successors, like Johnny Jones, Johnnie Taylor and the extremely 'bad' Jimmy Outler:<br /><br /><div align="center"><iframe width="400" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VmizCScGLmY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />Just positively amazing stuff, I don't think you can say enough about LeRoy's driving guitar work, and just how great The Stirrers continued to be after Sam departed. He and Leroy remained very close and, in his mind, I don't think Cooke ever really left. <i>"Sam was a Soul Stirrer until the night somebody murdered him,"</i> Leroy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Sam-Superstar-LeRoy-Crume/dp/1493145339">said</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Q15bMqxBZmY/VKCGjCs9oKI/AAAAAAAAJtI/MZUNNULJU7k/s1600/JET641231a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Q15bMqxBZmY/VKCGjCs9oKI/AAAAAAAAJtI/MZUNNULJU7k/s400/JET641231a.jpg"></a></div><i>"Sam was as close as any blood relative I've ever had... me and Sam had that special connection."</i> Heartbroken, Leroy had lost his best friend, and within a few months he quit the group as well. He maintained that there was a lot more to Sam's death than met the eye, and that he was killed for not playing the game the way certain people wanted him to...<br /><br />Leroy eventually wound up back in Chicago where, in addition to getting a job driving a bus for the CTA, he would become a member of the <a href="http://jubileeshowcase.com/">Jubilee Showcase</a> house band. He began performing some secular material with a friend of his from The Clefs of Calvary named Calvin April, and somehow they wound up recording at American for Sound Stage 7 in 1968.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pw4IyicmWgk/VKCgB99Ij9I/AAAAAAAAJtY/1l8I2MclDbg/s1600/SS7%2B2612B.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pw4IyicmWgk/VKCgB99Ij9I/AAAAAAAAJtY/1l8I2MclDbg/s200/SS7%2B2612B.jpg"></a></div><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pc26245c70ce3f4ffd17dd8cb19075af3Z1x4R1REYGt8.mp3">I'm Alright Now</a><br />SS7 2612<br /><i>"We recorded that in Memphis. It was just before the assassination of Martin Luther King, in fact, they were checking into The Lorraine Motel as Calvin and I were checking out. We even talked for awhile to some of the people with him, like Jessie Jackson, The Staple Singers, and some of the others. The following night after getting back to Chicago, I turned on the TV, and it had just happened.  That's  how I first heard about it... by the way, <b>Soul X 2</b>, was NOT my favorite name, it was given to us by the DJ from, WLAC radio in Nashville, Hoss Allen. I later renamed us <b>Branding Iron</b>, and that's the way that story goes!"</i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z6qMFelvLE8/VKCnVz09pAI/AAAAAAAAJto/KhxKdgu9H2k/s1600/AlBell-JJ.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z6qMFelvLE8/VKCnVz09pAI/AAAAAAAAJto/KhxKdgu9H2k/s200/AlBell-JJ.jpg"></a></div>In the wake of the tragic killing of Dr. King in their own  backyard, Al Bell was faced with re-creating the newly independent Stax Records into something more than the sum of its parts. He immediately signed The Staple Singers and hooked up with Jesse Jackson and SCLC compatriot Larry Shaw in Chicago in an effort to keep the label on the cutting edge. While in Chicago, Pervis Staples took him to see 'Father of The Blues' <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/06/willie-dixon-and-allstars-walking-blues.html">Willie Dixon</a> who had recorded a demo he wanted Bell to hear.<br /><br />Willie had written <a href="http://youtu.be/wi7eo-WPKgw">Right Tight and Out of Sight</a> with a soul duo like Sam & Dave in mind. Bell liked the song, but was more interested in signing the guys who were singing it... Leroy and Calvin - now known as Branding Iron.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3L-vLAJ2_pM/VKCudqyU92I/AAAAAAAAJt4/xq2xtM3r0EA/s1600/VOLT%2B4043.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3L-vLAJ2_pM/VKCudqyU92I/AAAAAAAAJt4/xq2xtM3r0EA/s200/VOLT%2B4043.jpg"></a></div>The record began to make some local noise, which led to an appearance on another Chicago institution, <a href="http://soultrain.com/">Soul Train</a>. Things were definitely looking up! The flip of that first Volt release, <a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P1d905d9821a7a218b857e9361634d332Z1x4R1REamZz.mp3">Slave For Love</a> was written by another legendary Blues figure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Lenoir">J.B. Lenoir</a>. Arranged by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Barge">Gene Barge</a>, the 45 was about as Chicago as you could get. Despite Bell's assurance that <i>"you guys are going to make so much money, you won't be able to count it all!,"</i> the record never made the national charts and, after one more Volt release, they were let go. Although Branding Iron would cut <a href="http://www.45cat.com/record/st10024pl25st10024pl27">another 45</a> for the tiny Stag label (produced by Leroy's brother Dillard), by then he was back on the road with The Soul Stirrers, where he would remain for the rest of his life.<Br /><br /><div align="center"><iframe width="400" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eq3pM9A_-UU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><i>"I thank God for allowing me to hang around as long as I have, after literally taking away all of those that once walked along with me when this journey started... they're all gone. Now that's the scary part, because I know the next soldier to fall will definitely be me. Sometimes I wonder why was I left as the last Soul Stirrer standing, and then something seems to say, it's not yours to reason why. It's not for any man to understand God's plan."</i><br /><br />Leroy Crume was called home on October 20th.<br /><br />___________________________________<br /><a href="http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2014/12/23/3482399/jo-jo-benson-dies-at-victory-drive.html"><b>JO JO BENSON</b></a><br /><a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/chip-young-dies/"><b>CHIP YOUNG</b></a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xk4e7XUJt0/VKC7WR2C5yI/AAAAAAAAJuI/PBCKGBE4XFQ/s1600/SSS%2B761.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xk4e7XUJt0/VKC7WR2C5yI/AAAAAAAAJuI/PBCKGBE4XFQ/s200/SSS%2B761.jpg" title="scan courtesy 45cat"></a></div><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pc9acc5fc51e7b7da38a14749e70dd7a5Z1x4R1REamZx.mp3">Soulshake</a><br />SSS 2612<br />After Huey Meaux was hauled off to prison in 1968, his friend Shelby Singleton brought the duo he had been cutting hits on at Grits 'n' Gravy to Music Row to record what has to be the only Soul song ever to feature both an electric sitar and a pedal steel guitar!

A contemporary of influential Beale Street sax men like Bill Harvey, Fred Ford, George Coleman and Ben Branch, Floyd's unique Baritone sound laid the foundation for what was to come.<br /><p><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DP8w-nTluAg/VE6K8wiVtOI/AAAAAAAAJlA/lCi8sVBVoDw/s400/plantationframeweb.jpg">In the early sixties, Floyd would form his own group with some of the younger members of Ben Branch's band, including a couple of kids named Howard Grimes and Isaac Hayes. The Floyd Newman Orchestra would become the house band at the fabled Plantation Inn, and they were there on McElmore Avenue with <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2008/01/triumphs-raw-dough-volt-100.html">Chips Moman</a> at the very dawn of the Stax era.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RBhx8gvtNiE/VE6PHhLQhsI/AAAAAAAAJlU/O5IkRQSMc3g/s1600/Last%2BNight.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RBhx8gvtNiE/VE6PHhLQhsI/AAAAAAAAJlU/O5IkRQSMc3g/s200/Last%2BNight.jpg"></a></div>Although not a vocalist by any stretch of the imagination, Floyd's voice is one of the most recognized in the history of Memphis R&B. He was the man who intoned <b><i>"Ooh... Last Night"</i></b> and <b><i>"Ohh... YEAH!"</i></b> on the fledgling (as in it was still called Satellite) label's breakthrough smash by The Mar-Keys in the Summer of 1961. It was Floyd and tenor sax partner Gilbert Caple who came up with that trademark horn riff that will live on forever.<br /><br /><p><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p9Jiver-yn8/VFFl0Pd5K2I/AAAAAAAAJo0/t2eWuIaSnNA/s400/tdowd2.jpg"><br />Mining the same territory, this cool B Side we have here was issued as the flip of the only 45 Stax would press under Floyd's name, released shortly after he helped propel another Stax classic into the top ten, Rufus Thomas' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_the_Dog">Walking The Dog</a>. It was that baritone heavy Stax sound that <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2008/08/wilson-pickett-soul-dance-number-three.html">Jerry Wexler</a> dubbed 'those Memphis horns' and, along with folks like Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/10/gene-bowlegs-miller-what-time-ye-got.html">Bowlegs Miller</a>, Jack Hale, James Mitchell and Joe Arnold, Floyd began to deliver that big fat sound to Muscle Shoals and beyond, playing on scores of hit records in the process.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bJQLtXbgy-Q/VE7MrJ3ULZI/AAAAAAAAJl0/WFUzAGX0z78/s1600/wIsaac.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bJQLtXbgy-Q/VE7MrJ3ULZI/AAAAAAAAJl0/WFUzAGX0z78/s400/wIsaac.jpg"></a></div>As Issac Hayes became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Moses_(album)">Black Moses</a>, he never forgot his mentor, and took Floyd with him on his way to Super Stardom. He was an integral part of Hayes' triumphal appearance at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattstax">Wattstax</a>, and remained with him on the road until Isaac decided to 'take a break' and open his own studio and label that he would name after his monster 1969 LP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Buttered_Soul">Hot Buttered Soul</a> (HBS).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liT13f9f_ck/VFDoOrpioBI/AAAAAAAAJmM/BJgpoP8AEqg/s1600/HBS12138.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liT13f9f_ck/VFDoOrpioBI/AAAAAAAAJmM/BJgpoP8AEqg/s200/HBS12138.jpg"></a></div>Although Floyd considers Isaac a true musical genius, he told us <i><b>"That was a mistake. While we were taking a break, they released a man that sounded just like him - Barry White. Barry White just killed Isaac. Everybody thought it was Isaac, but Isaac wasn't on the road. So then, Isaac said, 'Let's go back...', but Barry White had taken it away from him... Barry White smothered him."</b></i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iYRwzZeBVHw/VFDq_l1G6bI/AAAAAAAAJmY/Bz7BzI4WSXk/s1600/wstills.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iYRwzZeBVHw/VFDq_l1G6bI/AAAAAAAAJmY/Bz7BzI4WSXk/s400/wstills.jpg"></a></div>Floyd Newman, however, landed on his feet. After playing baritone on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stills_2">Stephen Stills 2</a>, Stephen took him on tour with him. This was back when Stills' phone was still ringing, and being 'on tour' included the full rock-star magilla of private jets to Europe, limos, red carpets and the finest hotels. Quite a different experience than riding on the B.B. King bus!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffvZIyMhDYg/VFFh-mgm2FI/AAAAAAAAJoI/zL1uudjxzYc/s1600/fsn111director.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffvZIyMhDYg/VFFh-mgm2FI/AAAAAAAAJoI/zL1uudjxzYc/s320/fsn111director.jpg"></a></div>As the Memphis music scene continued to self-destruct in the late seventies, Floyd settled in to his career as Music Director and Guidance Counselor at area schools, thereby influencing generations of up and coming musicians...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7NDaMYeEHL8/VFD0kyf5saI/AAAAAAAAJmw/uz61wfmx2M4/s1600/floyd08.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7NDaMYeEHL8/VFD0kyf5saI/AAAAAAAAJmw/uz61wfmx2M4/s200/floyd08.jpg"></a></div>When <a href="http://prestonlauterbach.com/">Preston Lauterbach</a> and I were scheming and plotting to put Hi Rhythm back together with <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/04/otis-clay-brand-new-thing-hi-2206.html">Otis Clay</a> for the <a href="http://www.ovwright.org/">O.V. Wright</a> benefit and <a href="http://www.ovwright.org/schedule">tribute concert</a> in Memphis in 2008, we left the recruitment of the horn section up to them. I'm not sure if it was Floyd's former Plantation Inn bandmate Howard Grimes who made the call that brought Floyd out of retirement to anchor 'those Memphis horns' for us that night, but it was an experience I'll never forget. <b><i>"If you think you're the Soul Detective,"</i></b> Howard said, <b><i>"you ought to talk to Floyd..."</i></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tguREKRZbv0/VFD4j8FhwCI/AAAAAAAAJm8/qrrL2d7xx7E/s1600/FloydJean.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tguREKRZbv0/VFD4j8FhwCI/AAAAAAAAJm8/qrrL2d7xx7E/s400/FloydJean.jpg"></a></div>...and so I did, beginning an ongoing discussion through letters and phone calls that culminated in Floyd and his remarkable wife Jean welcoming the Soul Detective team into their home in August of 2012.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o6WPrMoU0o8/VFD6ppXPHjI/AAAAAAAAJnI/flP7CCaxo6U/s1600/horndetail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o6WPrMoU0o8/VFD6ppXPHjI/AAAAAAAAJnI/flP7CCaxo6U/s200/horndetail.jpg"></a></div>Floyd's tales of his life in music are truly fascinating, but perhaps the most amazing one is the story of his horn: <b><i>"I'm still playing that 1949 horn that my father bought for me that cost $200 out of the pawn shop. I've never played but one horn all these years... I didn't need but one."</i></b> Running down the serial numbers years later, he found out that the horn was manufactured in 1918. Imagine?

A contemporary of influential Beale Street sax men like Bill Harvey, Fred Ford, George Coleman and Ben Branch, Floyd's unique Baritone sound laid the foundation for what was to come.<br /><p><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DP8w-nTluAg/VE6K8wiVtOI/AAAAAAAAJlA/lCi8sVBVoDw/s400/plantationframeweb.jpg">In the early sixties, Floyd would form his own group with some of the younger members of Ben Branch's band, including a couple of kids named Howard Grimes and Isaac Hayes. The Floyd Newman Orchestra would become the house band at the fabled Plantation Inn, and they were there on McElmore Avenue with <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2008/01/triumphs-raw-dough-volt-100.html">Chips Moman</a> at the very dawn of the Stax era.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RBhx8gvtNiE/VE6PHhLQhsI/AAAAAAAAJlU/O5IkRQSMc3g/s1600/Last%2BNight.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RBhx8gvtNiE/VE6PHhLQhsI/AAAAAAAAJlU/O5IkRQSMc3g/s200/Last%2BNight.jpg"></a></div>Although not a vocalist by any stretch of the imagination, Floyd's voice is one of the most recognized in the history of Memphis R&B. He was the man who intoned <b><i>"Ooh... Last Night"</i></b> and <b><i>"Ohh... YEAH!"</i></b> on the fledgling (as in it was still called Satellite) label's breakthrough smash by The Mar-Keys in the Summer of 1961. It was Floyd and tenor sax partner Gilbert Caple who came up with that trademark horn riff that will live on forever.<br /><br /><p><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p9Jiver-yn8/VFFl0Pd5K2I/AAAAAAAAJo0/t2eWuIaSnNA/s400/tdowd2.jpg"><br />Mining the same territory, this cool B Side we have here was issued as the flip of the only 45 Stax would press under Floyd's name, released shortly after he helped propel another Stax classic into the top ten, Rufus Thomas' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_the_Dog">Walking The Dog</a>. It was that baritone heavy Stax sound that <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2008/08/wilson-pickett-soul-dance-number-three.html">Jerry Wexler</a> dubbed 'those Memphis horns' and, along with folks like Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/10/gene-bowlegs-miller-what-time-ye-got.html">Bowlegs Miller</a>, Jack Hale, James Mitchell and Joe Arnold, Floyd began to deliver that big fat sound to Muscle Shoals and beyond, playing on scores of hit records in the process.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bJQLtXbgy-Q/VE7MrJ3ULZI/AAAAAAAAJl0/WFUzAGX0z78/s1600/wIsaac.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bJQLtXbgy-Q/VE7MrJ3ULZI/AAAAAAAAJl0/WFUzAGX0z78/s400/wIsaac.jpg"></a></div>As Issac Hayes became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Moses_(album)">Black Moses</a>, he never forgot his mentor, and took Floyd with him on his way to Super Stardom. He was an integral part of Hayes' triumphal appearance at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattstax">Wattstax</a>, and remained with him on the road until Isaac decided to 'take a break' and open his own studio and label that he would name after his monster 1969 LP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Buttered_Soul">Hot Buttered Soul</a> (HBS).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liT13f9f_ck/VFDoOrpioBI/AAAAAAAAJmM/BJgpoP8AEqg/s1600/HBS12138.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liT13f9f_ck/VFDoOrpioBI/AAAAAAAAJmM/BJgpoP8AEqg/s200/HBS12138.jpg"></a></div>Although Floyd considers Isaac a true musical genius, he told us <i><b>"That was a mistake. While we were taking a break, they released a man that sounded just like him - Barry White. Barry White just killed Isaac. Everybody thought it was Isaac, but Isaac wasn't on the road. So then, Isaac said, 'Let's go back...', but Barry White had taken it away from him... Barry White smothered him."</b></i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iYRwzZeBVHw/VFDq_l1G6bI/AAAAAAAAJmY/Bz7BzI4WSXk/s1600/wstills.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iYRwzZeBVHw/VFDq_l1G6bI/AAAAAAAAJmY/Bz7BzI4WSXk/s400/wstills.jpg"></a></div>Floyd Newman, however, landed on his feet. After playing baritone on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stills_2">Stephen Stills 2</a>, Stephen took him on tour with him. This was back when Stills' phone was still ringing, and being 'on tour' included the full rock-star magilla of private jets to Europe, limos, red carpets and the finest hotels. Quite a different experience than riding on the B.B. King bus!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffvZIyMhDYg/VFFh-mgm2FI/AAAAAAAAJoI/zL1uudjxzYc/s1600/fsn111director.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffvZIyMhDYg/VFFh-mgm2FI/AAAAAAAAJoI/zL1uudjxzYc/s320/fsn111director.jpg"></a></div>As the Memphis music scene continued to self-destruct in the late seventies, Floyd settled in to his career as Music Director and Guidance Counselor at area schools, thereby influencing generations of up and coming musicians...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7NDaMYeEHL8/VFD0kyf5saI/AAAAAAAAJmw/uz61wfmx2M4/s1600/floyd08.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7NDaMYeEHL8/VFD0kyf5saI/AAAAAAAAJmw/uz61wfmx2M4/s200/floyd08.jpg"></a></div>When <a href="http://prestonlauterbach.com/">Preston Lauterbach</a> and I were scheming and plotting to put Hi Rhythm back together with <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/04/otis-clay-brand-new-thing-hi-2206.html">Otis Clay</a> for the <a href="http://www.ovwright.org/">O.V. Wright</a> benefit and <a href="http://www.ovwright.org/schedule">tribute concert</a> in Memphis in 2008, we left the recruitment of the horn section up to them. I'm not sure if it was Floyd's former Plantation Inn bandmate Howard Grimes who made the call that brought Floyd out of retirement to anchor 'those Memphis horns' for us that night, but it was an experience I'll never forget. <b><i>"If you think you're the Soul Detective,"</i></b> Howard said, <b><i>"you ought to talk to Floyd..."</i></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tguREKRZbv0/VFD4j8FhwCI/AAAAAAAAJm8/qrrL2d7xx7E/s1600/FloydJean.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tguREKRZbv0/VFD4j8FhwCI/AAAAAAAAJm8/qrrL2d7xx7E/s400/FloydJean.jpg"></a></div>...and so I did, beginning an ongoing discussion through letters and phone calls that culminated in Floyd and his remarkable wife Jean welcoming the Soul Detective team into their home in August of 2012.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o6WPrMoU0o8/VFD6ppXPHjI/AAAAAAAAJnI/flP7CCaxo6U/s1600/horndetail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o6WPrMoU0o8/VFD6ppXPHjI/AAAAAAAAJnI/flP7CCaxo6U/s200/horndetail.jpg"></a></div>Floyd's tales of his life in music are truly fascinating, but perhaps the most amazing one is the story of his horn: <b><i>"I'm still playing that 1949 horn that my father bought for me that cost $200 out of the pawn shop. I've never played but one horn all these years... I didn't need but one."</i></b> Running down the serial numbers years later, he found out that the horn was manufactured in 1918. Imagine?

He was a genuine Giant.<br /><br />Since he passed away last week, there's been quite a lot written about him in the press, but it all seems to focus (understandably so) on the atom-bomb like explosion of Rock & Roll that emanated from his J&M Studio in the early fifties, but there's a lot more to the story...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5fkJ-y3H5dU/VBeJ_Oo0qoI/AAAAAAAAJjg/VeJvj45rEpc/s1600/Ernie-K-Doe-mother-in-law_thumb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5fkJ-y3H5dU/VBeJ_Oo0qoI/AAAAAAAAJjg/VeJvj45rEpc/s200/Ernie-K-Doe-mother-in-law_thumb.jpg"></a></div>Our mission over on <a href="http://cosimocode.com/">The Cosimo Code</a> is to demonstrate that Cos played just as large a role in the big fat sound of the 'second wave' of New Orleans chart domination - the period I like to call 'The Mother-In-Law Era'. Starting roughly with Jessie Hill's <a href="http://youtu.be/i8Dz6bqFS4c">Ooh Poo Pah Doo</a> in May of 1960 and continuing on through Barbara Lynn's <a href="http://youtu.be/-Rnl6CBlRU4">You're Gonna Need Me</a> in December of '62, records cut at Cosimo Recording on Governor Nicholls (not, as is widely reported, at J&M, which had closed it's doors in late 1956) spent an incredible 477 weeks on the Billboard Charts, including <i>14 weeks</i> at #1 R&B. <i>Wow!</i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWJdskZw00U/VBc5a8dWVbI/AAAAAAAAJiM/bGbx-KtzbgM/s1600/BB610731.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWJdskZw00U/VBc5a8dWVbI/AAAAAAAAJiM/bGbx-KtzbgM/s200/BB610731.jpg"></a></div>People also refer to this as the 'post Fats Domino' era but, as you can see from today's selection, that is not entirely accurate. Cosimo continued to work with Fats and Dave Bartholomew after the move from J&M, cutting quite a few hits in the process. Judging from the Billboard ad at left, Imperial wasn't quite sure which side of this one was going to take off, but it turned out to be  the flip, <a href="http://youtu.be/xW95gpBHz8w">Let The Four Winds Blow</a>, which would climb all the way to #2 R&B in the Summer of 1961 (kept from the top slot by Bobby Lewis' monster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tossin'_and_Turnin'">Tossin' and Turnin'</a>), and become Fats' last appearance in the top ten. Both sides are great, and a testimony to the depth and variety of material that Cosimo was cutting at his studio in the early sixties... a period which is often overlooked.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9WhE8OzV8g/VBdAVO5G2RI/AAAAAAAAJic/R1dl-9YglRo/s1600/-fc2f9ff7df2174ff.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9WhE8OzV8g/VBdAVO5G2RI/AAAAAAAAJic/R1dl-9YglRo/s200/-fc2f9ff7df2174ff.JPG"></a></div>Cosimo's unique vision and expertise in the studio would continue to be felt well into the 'soul era' <i>(for more on all of that, please visit <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2014/09/tony-owens-i-know-you-dont-love-me-no.html">The A Side</a>)</i>, and the music he had a hand in creating will live on forever.

He was a genuine Giant.<br /><br />Since he passed away last week, there's been quite a lot written about him in the press, but it all seems to focus (understandably so) on the atom-bomb like explosion of Rock & Roll that emanated from his J&M Studio in the early fifties, but there's a lot more to the story...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5fkJ-y3H5dU/VBeJ_Oo0qoI/AAAAAAAAJjg/VeJvj45rEpc/s1600/Ernie-K-Doe-mother-in-law_thumb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5fkJ-y3H5dU/VBeJ_Oo0qoI/AAAAAAAAJjg/VeJvj45rEpc/s200/Ernie-K-Doe-mother-in-law_thumb.jpg"></a></div>Our mission over on <a href="http://cosimocode.com/">The Cosimo Code</a> is to demonstrate that Cos played just as large a role in the big fat sound of the 'second wave' of New Orleans chart domination - the period I like to call 'The Mother-In-Law Era'. Starting roughly with Jessie Hill's <a href="http://youtu.be/i8Dz6bqFS4c">Ooh Poo Pah Doo</a> in May of 1960 and continuing on through Barbara Lynn's <a href="http://youtu.be/-Rnl6CBlRU4">You're Gonna Need Me</a> in December of '62, records cut at Cosimo Recording on Governor Nicholls (not, as is widely reported, at J&M, which had closed it's doors in late 1956) spent an incredible 477 weeks on the Billboard Charts, including <i>14 weeks</i> at #1 R&B. <i>Wow!</i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWJdskZw00U/VBc5a8dWVbI/AAAAAAAAJiM/bGbx-KtzbgM/s1600/BB610731.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWJdskZw00U/VBc5a8dWVbI/AAAAAAAAJiM/bGbx-KtzbgM/s200/BB610731.jpg"></a></div>People also refer to this as the 'post Fats Domino' era but, as you can see from today's selection, that is not entirely accurate. Cosimo continued to work with Fats and Dave Bartholomew after the move from J&M, cutting quite a few hits in the process. Judging from the Billboard ad at left, Imperial wasn't quite sure which side of this one was going to take off, but it turned out to be  the flip, <a href="http://youtu.be/xW95gpBHz8w">Let The Four Winds Blow</a>, which would climb all the way to #2 R&B in the Summer of 1961 (kept from the top slot by Bobby Lewis' monster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tossin'_and_Turnin'">Tossin' and Turnin'</a>), and become Fats' last appearance in the top ten. Both sides are great, and a testimony to the depth and variety of material that Cosimo was cutting at his studio in the early sixties... a period which is often overlooked.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9WhE8OzV8g/VBdAVO5G2RI/AAAAAAAAJic/R1dl-9YglRo/s1600/-fc2f9ff7df2174ff.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9WhE8OzV8g/VBdAVO5G2RI/AAAAAAAAJic/R1dl-9YglRo/s200/-fc2f9ff7df2174ff.JPG"></a></div>Cosimo's unique vision and expertise in the studio would continue to be felt well into the 'soul era' <i>(for more on all of that, please visit <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2014/09/tony-owens-i-know-you-dont-love-me-no.html">The A Side</a>)</i>, and the music he had a hand in creating will live on forever. It is hard to imagine what the world might have been like without him...

They called themselves <b>The Womack Brothers</b>, and Friendly promised the Lord that if he sent him five sons, he would see to it that they would carry on the tradition and sing Gospel under that name. He moved to Cleveland, got work in a steel mill, and before long his prayers had been answered.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/bobby55.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/bobby55.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Friendly's new group, <b>The Voices Of Love</b>, would rehearse up at the Womack house, and his boys would listen in, doing imitations of the various members later on that kept them in stitches. The middle brother, Bobby, began sneaking around and playing his father's guitar while he was at work. Left handed, he had to figure out his own method, with the strings "upside down". (He still plays that way today...)<br /><br />By the early fifties, Friendly was keeping his promise, and had his boys singing Gospel at churches around the area. In 1953, he asked S.R. Crain, a senior member of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_Stirrers">The Soul Stirrers</a>, if they could open up for them at a program held at Cleveland's Friendship Baptist Church. He was in the process of telling them to "stick to Sunday School", when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke">Sam Cooke</a> overheard and pushed Crain to let them do it. <b>The Womack Brothers</b> were a big hit, and Sam made sure that the congregation forked over some "quiet money" to the family to help them with expenses. The $73 they collected seemed like a million bucks to 9 year old Bobby, and, from that moment on, he wanted to be "just like Sam Cooke".<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/valentinos.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/valentinos.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The Brothers career took off from there, and they began traveling the "Gospel Highway", working with groups like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Staple_Singers">The Staple Singers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Blind_Boys_of_Mississippi">The Five Blind Boys Of Mississippi</a>. The Blind Boys were impressed with young Bobby's guitar work, and took him on the road with them. When their fabled lead singer <a href="http://afgen.com/blind.html">Archie Brownlee</a> died of pneumonia in 1960, he was replaced by the great <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/roscoe-robinson">Roscoe Robinson</a>. It was Robinson who believed in the potential of the Womack boys, and called old friend Sam Cooke.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/SAR.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/SAR.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Cooke, who had just started up his own SAR label, was in the market for young talent and agreed to meet the brothers in Detroit. Sam was pushing them to 'cross-over' as he had done, but the Womacks, fearing the wrath of the Father (both the one up in Heaven, and their own back in Cleveland), were reluctant to do so. He made a deal with them; "Okay, fellas, we'll cut you all a Gospel record. But if it don't hit, will you all cut me a pop?" The deal was done, and The Womack Brothers' first single <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SAR-Records-Story-Pack-Booklet/dp/B000003BD4/sr=8-1/qid=1158169453/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=music">Somebody's Wrong</a>, was released on SAR in 1961.<br /><br />It flopped. Now it was their turn to make good on a promise. <b>J.W. Alexander</b>, Sam's partner at SAR, changed their name to The Valentinos and they re-worked the lyrics to a Gospel song Bobby had written for their first session (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SAR-Records-Story-Pack-Booklet/dp/B000003BD4/sr=8-1/qid=1158169453/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=music">Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray</a>) and came up with the great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SAR-Records-Story-Pack-Booklet/dp/B000003BD4/sr=8-1/qid=1158169453/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=music">Lookin' For A Love</a>. It sold two million copies in the summer of 1962, and spent over 3 months on the charts, cracking the top ten R&B and even breaking into the Billboard Hot 100. Friendly wanted no part in any of this, of course, and was just as glad to see his boys take off for California in the car Sam paid for, than to hear them sing 'the devil's music' in his own home.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/womack.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/womack.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>It was Sam who saw something in Bobby, and made him the lead singer in place of his brother Curtis. "Curtis sings pretty like me." he said, " But now Bobby, he sings with <i>authority</i>. When Bobby sings he <i>demands</i> attention." Cooke sent the Valentinos out on tour with <a href="http://www.funky-stuff.com/">James Brown</a> to school them in the ways of the R&B road, and when they came back all starched, pressed and walking in unison, he knew their 'basic training' had been a success. Sam next took Bobby out with him as a guitar player in his own band (much to his brothers' chagrin), and, in many ways, made him his "proteg". He chose to let Bobby ride in the limo with him (while everyone else in the band was back in the station wagon), and they talked for hours while America rolled on by. Bobby always had his guitar on hand, and Sam, it is said, got quite a few song ideas by listening to him play (when Womack confronted him with this, Sam said, "Okay, I'm taking your shit, but I'm doing you better than James Brown would... "). Suffice it to say that both men got something they needed from the other.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/allovernow.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/allovernow.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>In June of 1964, J.W. Alexander was pulling out all the stops to promote the new Valentinos single, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SAR-Records-Story-Pack-Booklet/dp/B000003BD4/sr=8-1/qid=1158169453/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=music">It's All Over Now</a>. Radio stations all over the country were flooded with advance promo copies of the rockin' shout out record with the 'hook' that just couldn't miss (Bobby had written it after hearing his uncle Wes say that about his Aunt Betty about a thousand times). The Rolling Stones heard it in New York while they were in the studio for an interview with <a href="http://www.murraythek.com/">Murray The K</a> (aka 'the fifth Beatle'). Their manager, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Loog_Oldham">Andrew Loog Oldham</a>, contacted Sam about performing rights, and they recorded the song within a week at the Chess Studios in Chicago. Their record company (Decca/London) got into the act and "rush-released" the single, putting it out on both sides of the big pond <i>the day before</i> the Valentinos' version was officially released. Can you imagine these guys?<br /><br />It was the Stones' breakthrough record, becoming their first number one hit in the UK, and rising to #26 here in the US. The Valentinos' original didn't stand a chance, spending only two weeks on the charts and stalling at #94 R&B. When they found out Sam had okayed the licensing of the song, they couldn't believe it. "What do I need this Pat Boone shit for?" Bobby said, "Let them get their own songs. They mean nothing to me!" Cooke, always the visionary, tried to explain to them that this was the way things were headed in the the music industry, and that they'd be a "part of history". Although it took him quite a while to get there, Bobby finally admiited "...he was right, man. He was always in the future."<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/CHANGE.0.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/CHANGE.0.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>When Sam Cooke wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Legend-1951-1964-Sam-Cooke/dp/samples/B00009N1ZV/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8#disc_1">A Change Is Gonna Come</a> in late 1963, it scared him. After he had gone into the studio and recorded it, with Ren Hall's great big arrangement and everything, he called up Bobby. "Come on over, I want you to hear something", he said. He played the song for him on his huge movie theatre speakers, there in the dark. Sam 'looked right through him'... "what do you think, Bobby?", he asked. "It sounds like death... it's just so eerie. It gives me the chills, Sam."  Cooke said he had to agree, and told him "I promise I won't ever release that song... not while I'm alive."<br /><br />When Sam was shot to death On December 11, 1964, Bobby's world was torn apart. He remembered his reaction to the song, how he had told Sam a second time, "It sounds like death, like somebody died or somebody is going to die"... RCA released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Legend-1951-1964-Sam-Cooke/dp/samples/B00009N1ZV/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8#disc_1">A Change Is Gonna Come</a> on December 22nd, as the B side of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Legend-1951-1964-Sam-Cooke/dp/samples/B00009N1ZV/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8#disc_1">Shake</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/BWBC.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/BWBC.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>On March 5th 1965, Bobby Womack married Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara Campbell at the Los Angeles County Court House (they had been turned away two weeks before because he had not yet turned 21). Whether Barbara was motivated by love, a need for support or some kind of revenge, we'll probably never know. Bobby has said that he married her to protect Sam's family, and to keep Barbara from "doing something crazy". In any event, the record-buying public (as well as Sam's family in Chicago) viewed it as too much too soon. They saw Campbell as a shameless woman who had no respect for their idol, and Womack as a little gold digger who could never fill Sam's shoes. The papers ate it up.<br /><br />As SAR began to disintegrate around them, the Valentinos signed with Chess Records, but nothing much was happening. Today's selection is the B side of Bobby's first single under his own name, and was released on their Checker subsidiary in 1965 (it's the flip of  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Bobby%20Womack%20&%20the%20Valentinos:1921048750">I Found A True Love</a>, the original version of the tune <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">Wilson Pickett</a> would take to #11 in 1968). They couldn't give the record away. As Bobby has said, at this point disk jockeys were "throwing his records in the garbage", as nobody wanted to hear them. I personally think this is a great song, and shows what a pro Womack had become during his years with Sam. Although it may be a little over-produced (there's no production credits on the label, so I'm not sure by whom), it still cranks along with Bobby's guitar holding down the bottom. I love the vocals, which definitely show Cooke's influence (how could they not)? When he belts out there towards the end that "don't nobody seem to want ol' Bob", it sounds like a wry commentary on what was going down at the time...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/autobio.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/autobio.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>We'll pick up the rest of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">The Womack</a>'s unreal story in some future post, but meanwhile let me recommend his recently released autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1844541487/ref=dp_olp_2/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8">Midnight Mover: The True Story of the Greatest Soul Singer in the World</a> (modest, he's not) as well as the encyclopedic (and indispensable) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Boogie-Triumph-Sam-Cooke/dp/0316377945/sr=1-1/qid=1158168248/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=books">Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke</a> by our man in the street, Peter Guralnick.<br /><br />Great stuff.<br /><br />(<i><a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/12/bobby-womack-dont-look-back-liberty.html">to be continued...</a></i>)";s:4:"link";s:81:"http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2014/06/bobby-womack-of-valentinos-lonesome-man.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (Red Kelly)";s:7:"summary";s:13855:"<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/CHECKER%201122.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/320/CHECKER%201122.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=Pe5d1bcf898ac01c1254c2b827fdc8b23Z1x4R1REY2B1&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pe5d1bcf898ac01c1254c2b827fdc8b23Z1x4R1REY2B1.mp3">A Lonesome Man</a><br /><h2>Part One Of The Story - first posted in 2006</h2><br />Friendly Womack sang Gospel with his brothers down in the coal mining country of West Virginia.

He was always in the future."<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/CHANGE.0.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/CHANGE.0.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>When Sam Cooke wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Legend-1951-1964-Sam-Cooke/dp/samples/B00009N1ZV/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8#disc_1">A Change Is Gonna Come</a> in late 1963, it scared him. After he had gone into the studio and recorded it, with Ren Hall's great big arrangement and everything, he called up Bobby. "Come on over, I want you to hear something", he said. He played the song for him on his huge movie theatre speakers, there in the dark. Sam 'looked right through him'... "what do you think, Bobby?", he asked. "It sounds like death... it's just so eerie. It gives me the chills, Sam."  Cooke said he had to agree, and told him "I promise I won't ever release that song... not while I'm alive."<br /><br />When Sam was shot to death On December 11, 1964, Bobby's world was torn apart. He remembered his reaction to the song, how he had told Sam a second time, "It sounds like death, like somebody died or somebody is going to die"...

Whether Barbara was motivated by love, a need for support or some kind of revenge, we'll probably never know. Bobby has said that he married her to protect Sam's family, and to keep Barbara from "doing something crazy". In any event, the record-buying public (as well as Sam's family in Chicago) viewed it as too much too soon. They saw Campbell as a shameless woman who had no respect for their idol, and Womack as a little gold digger who could never fill Sam's shoes. The papers ate it up.<br /><br />As SAR began to disintegrate around them, the Valentinos signed with Chess Records, but nothing much was happening. Today's selection is the B side of Bobby's first single under his own name, and was released on their Checker subsidiary in 1965 (it's the flip of  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Bobby%20Womack%20&%20the%20Valentinos:1921048750">I Found A True Love</a>, the original version of the tune <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">Wilson Pickett</a> would take to #11 in 1968). They couldn't give the record away. As Bobby has said, at this point disk jockeys were "throwing his records in the garbage", as nobody wanted to hear them. I personally think this is a great song, and shows what a pro Womack had become during his years with Sam. Although it may be a little over-produced (there's no production credits on the label, so I'm not sure by whom), it still cranks along with Bobby's guitar holding down the bottom. I love the vocals, which definitely show Cooke's influence (how could they not)? When he belts out there towards the end that "don't nobody seem to want ol' Bob", it sounds like a wry commentary on what was going down at the time...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/autobio.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/autobio.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>We'll pick up the rest of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/wilson-pickett-nothing-you-can-do.html">The Womack</a>'s unreal story in some future post, but meanwhile let me recommend his recently released autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1844541487/ref=dp_olp_2/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8">Midnight Mover: The True Story of the Greatest Soul Singer in the World</a> (modest, he's not) as well as the encyclopedic (and indispensable) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Boogie-Triumph-Sam-Cooke/dp/0316377945/sr=1-1/qid=1158168248/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4596516-8675245?ie=UTF8&s=books">Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke</a> by our man in the street, Peter Guralnick.<br /><br />Great stuff.<br /><br />(<i><a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/12/bobby-womack-dont-look-back-liberty.html">to be continued...</a></i>)";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1404168120;}i:15;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17177806.post-3598457522676365638";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 12:52:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:46:"Bobby Womack - Don't Look Back (Liberty 56186)";s:11:"description";s:21156:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R2UuXbmc7lI/AAAAAAAACG8/t6vymfyO7wc/s1600-h/LIBERTY+5686.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R2UuXbmc7lI/AAAAAAAACG8/t6vymfyO7wc/s320/LIBERTY+5686.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144569129421565522"></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P04fd645afa9d82015b97fa4e08754851Z1x4R1REYWFx&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P04fd645afa9d82015b97fa4e08754851Z1x4R1REYWFx.mp3">Don't Look Back</a><br /><h2>A REPOST FROM 2007</h2><br />OK, folks, it's hard to believe it was over a year ago that I promised you a second installment of the <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/bobby-womack-of-valentinos-lonesome.html">Bobby Womack saga</a>, but time flies when you're having fun, I guess...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16XqVhg8II/AAAAAAAACEU/55VwMVRTLDI/s1600-h/keymen+102.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16XqVhg8II/AAAAAAAACEU/55VwMVRTLDI/s200/keymen+102.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142714578091700354"></a>When we last left our hero, he was taking a lot of heat for marrying <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/sam-cooke-trouble-blues-rca-8803.html">Sam Cooke</a>'s widow, and was unable to get his records played on the radio, as the disk jockeys that had known and loved Sam were 'throwing his records in the garbage'.

He spent the next year or so out on the road with Brother Ray, playing over 200 dates a year.

The thing that finally got him fired, however, was that he complained about the fact that Ray would fly the band's plane himself. "Man, I couldn't sleep for thinking about our flights between gigs," Bobby said, "...a blind man was flying the plane. I had attacks about that." Incredible.

When Atlantic 2388 was released in early 1967, his last name had been misspelled as 'Wommack'.

"Bobby," he said. "there are some white boys down there; if you closed your eyes, you could not tell they weren't black. Those f#*@ers can play!" The studio he was referring to, of course, was American Sound, and in July of 1967, Bobby Womack flew into town, installed himself into the Trumpet Motel, and showed up at American for Pickett's first sessions there. In addition to playing guitar, he brought along another one of his compositions, the amazing <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719994">I'm In Love</a>, which The Wicked One would take to #6 R&amp;B later that year.

In the book he describes the American Group as "a strong house band, with <a href="http://bobbyemmons.com/">Bobby Emmons</a> on keyboards, <b>Tommy Cogbill</b> on Bass, <a href="http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview_bobby_wood.shtml">Bobby Wood</a> the piano player, drummer <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/gene-chrisman">Gene Chrisman</a>, and <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bassolo/">Mike Leech</a> who also played bass and arranged strings."

That sounds about right, and I think the friendly competition between the two guitarists created something more than the sum of its parts.

As Pickett travelled back to Muscle Shoals to record, Bobby made the trip with him, supplying much of his material in the process. All in all, Wilson recorded some seventeen Womack compositions (like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719999">I'm A Midnight Mover</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=793200&s=143441&i=793132">I Found A True Love</a>), and Bobby was happy to sit back and collect the publishing checks.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16uJlhg8PI/AAAAAAAACFM/qaUVBTDmq7w/s1600-h/FLY+ME+LP.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16uJlhg8PI/AAAAAAAACFM/qaUVBTDmq7w/s200/FLY+ME+LP.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142739304218423538"></a>Before he left California, however, Bobby had signed with Minit Records, after playing some of his songs for them as demos. They told him to go out and record something, and that they'd be happy to release it. After a couple of years of putting them off, Minit was finally looking for some 'product', only Bobby had given all of his originals away to Pickett. He started fooling around with a few standards with the guys in the studio, and the album that Minit finally received contained covers of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=762943">Fly Me To The Moon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">Moonlight In Vermont</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">California Dreamin'</a>.

Womack was onto something, and they let him run with it. When Womack covered a song, it became something else entirely. He made each one his own.

Minit would pull three more singles from the album for release in 1969 and early 1970.

Written by Womack's mentor Sam Cooke, it would become an R&amp;B top thirty hit in the summer of 1970. Today's positively infectious B side was the flip of that single. Originally written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptations">Temptations</a> in 1965, it had become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Williams_(The_Temptations)">Paul Williams</a> signature song, and closed out many a Temps performance. This version is better. Way better. Let me just say here that in all the time I've been doing this, this has to be the absolute BEST RECORD I've ever put up here. I mean it, boys and girls. The unbelievable Chips Moman production, Bobby's soulful vocals, the interplay of the guitars, the organ, the drums, the cookin' bass line... like the label says, it's 'An American Group Production', this time for one of their own, and was recorded around the same time that Elvis was in the building.

As it turned out, that wasn't so bad, as the people at United Artists seemed willing to listen, and gave him creative control over his releases.  1971 was also the year that he collaborated with <a href="http://www.dougpayne.com/bio.htm">Gabor Szabo</a> and came up with the immortal <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=993074&s=143441&i=992987">Breezin'</a>. Bobby also began working with <a href="http://www.phattadatta.com/">Sly Stone</a>, and appeared on his groundbreaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_a_Riot_Goin'_On">There's a Riot Going On</a> album. It was Sly who convinced him to lose the suit, and came up with the idea for the cool cover shot on his first UA album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000002TQ6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_olp_9?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1197396275&sr=8-9">Communication</a>. In many ways, this was the record that kind of defined what Womack, and much of black music in the seventies, was all about. The title track would hit the R&amp;B top forty, but the next single off the album, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=763037">That's The Way I Feel About 'Cha</a>, became his biggest hit yet, climbing to #2 R&amp;B in December of 1971.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17Ab1hg8VI/AAAAAAAACF8/b3rS5NTS4-M/s1600-h/Understanding.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17Ab1hg8VI/AAAAAAAACF8/b3rS5NTS4-M/s200/Understanding.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142759408960336210"></a>His next album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Bobby-Womack/dp/B000002TQ9/ref=pd_bxgy_m_text_b">Understanding</a>, was released in 1972. Just a fantastic record, Bobby Womack's genius is fully realized here for the first time. Establishing him as the R&amp;B superstar Sam Cooke had envisioned he was destined to become, there was no turning back. One of the last albums to be recorded at American before Moman closed it down, it was produced by Womack himself, and it shows. Two 45s were taken from the album, resulting in no less than three chart hits.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17EbFhg8WI/AAAAAAAACGE/9e-aP_OlURs/s1600-h/UA+50902.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17EbFhg8WI/AAAAAAAACGE/9e-aP_OlURs/s200/UA+50902.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142763794121945442"></a>The first of these, the timeless <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=762855">Woman's Gotta Have It</a>, became Bobby's first #1 hit in April of 1972.

He spent the next year or so out on the road with Brother Ray, playing over 200 dates a year.

The thing that finally got him fired, however, was that he complained about the fact that Ray would fly the band's plane himself.

When Atlantic 2388 was released in early 1967, his last name had been misspelled as 'Wommack'.

"Bobby," he said. "there are some white boys down there; if you closed your eyes, you could not tell they weren't black. Those f#*@ers can play!" The studio he was referring to, of course, was American Sound, and in July of 1967, Bobby Womack flew into town, installed himself into the Trumpet Motel, and showed up at American for Pickett's first sessions there. In addition to playing guitar, he brought along another one of his compositions, the amazing <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719994">I'm In Love</a>, which The Wicked One would take to #6 R&amp;B later that year.

In the book he describes the American Group as "a strong house band, with <a href="http://bobbyemmons.com/">Bobby Emmons</a> on keyboards, <b>Tommy Cogbill</b> on Bass, <a href="http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview_bobby_wood.shtml">Bobby Wood</a> the piano player, drummer <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/gene-chrisman">Gene Chrisman</a>, and <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bassolo/">Mike Leech</a> who also played bass and arranged strings."

That sounds about right, and I think the friendly competition between the two guitarists created something more than the sum of its parts. Chips saw that, and was happy to have Bobby on board.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16rDVhg8OI/AAAAAAAACFE/0mVb0qnEq3Q/s1600-h/BW+fame.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16rDVhg8OI/AAAAAAAACFE/0mVb0qnEq3Q/s200/BW+fame.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142735898309357794"></a>Womack also became a regular member of Wilson Pickett's touring band, and has some stories to tell about <i>that</i> whole experience. As Pickett travelled back to Muscle Shoals to record, Bobby made the trip with him, supplying much of his material in the process. All in all, Wilson recorded some seventeen Womack compositions (like <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=720011&s=143441&i=719999">I'm A Midnight Mover</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=793200&s=143441&i=793132">I Found A True Love</a>), and Bobby was happy to sit back and collect the publishing checks.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16uJlhg8PI/AAAAAAAACFM/qaUVBTDmq7w/s1600-h/FLY+ME+LP.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp2.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16uJlhg8PI/AAAAAAAACFM/qaUVBTDmq7w/s200/FLY+ME+LP.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142739304218423538"></a>Before he left California, however, Bobby had signed with Minit Records, after playing some of his songs for them as demos. They told him to go out and record something, and that they'd be happy to release it. After a couple of years of putting them off, Minit was finally looking for some 'product', only Bobby had given all of his originals away to Pickett. He started fooling around with a few standards with the guys in the studio, and the album that Minit finally received contained covers of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=762943">Fly Me To The Moon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">Moonlight In Vermont</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">California Dreamin'</a>.

Womack was onto something, and they let him run with it. When Womack covered a song, it became something else entirely. He made each one his own. Hoping to continue in that vein, his version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">I Left My Heart In San Francisco</a> was released as a single in early 1969, but only managed to dent the top fifty.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16yp1hg8RI/AAAAAAAACFc/1Veeqw2CYYw/s1600-h/prescription+LP.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R16yp1hg8RI/AAAAAAAACFc/1Veeqw2CYYw/s200/prescription+LP.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142744256315715858"></a>The album it was taken from, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">My Prescription</a>, is often overlooked, but represents, in my opinion, some of the best stuff to ever emanate from 827 Thomas Street. Minit would pull three more singles from the album for release in 1969 and early 1970. All of them charted, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0002TX08I/ref=dp_olp_2/102-4056057-9484167">How I Miss You Baby</a> climbing as high as #14 R&amp;B.

Written by Womack's mentor Sam Cooke, it would become an R&amp;B top thirty hit in the summer of 1970. Today's positively infectious B side was the flip of that single. Originally written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptations">Temptations</a> in 1965, it had become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Williams_(The_Temptations)">Paul Williams</a> signature song, and closed out many a Temps performance. This version is better. Way better. Let me just say here that in all the time I've been doing this, this has to be the absolute BEST RECORD I've ever put up here. I mean it, boys and girls. The unbelievable Chips Moman production, Bobby's soulful vocals, the interplay of the guitars, the organ, the drums, the cookin' bass line... like the label says, it's 'An American Group Production', this time for one of their own, and was recorded around the same time that Elvis was in the building. It just doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R166EVhg8TI/AAAAAAAACFs/Giyqlh7T1Ak/s1600-h/THE+WOMACK+LIVE.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R166EVhg8TI/AAAAAAAACFs/Giyqlh7T1Ak/s200/THE+WOMACK+LIVE.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142752408163643698"></a>Liberty would release a live album, as well as one last single on Bobby before being 'consolidated' right out of business itself in 1971, when something called The TransAmerica Corporation rolled it over into <a href="http://www.unitedartists.com/">United Artists</a>. The new label would release another single from the live album, one that was responsible for giving Bobby his nickname, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Womack-Live-Safety-Zone-Bobby/dp/B0002TX092/ref=pd_sim_m_title_1">The Preacher</a>, as he told it like it was over both sides of the 45, just like he did at the end of his live shows.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R168fVhg8UI/AAAAAAAACF0/2WPG3MW9GNw/s1600-h/Communication.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp1.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R168fVhg8UI/AAAAAAAACF0/2WPG3MW9GNw/s200/Communication.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142755071043367234"></a>Bobby, although he never changed anything, now found himself at his third record label in two years. As it turned out, that wasn't so bad, as the people at United Artists seemed willing to listen, and gave him creative control over his releases.  1971 was also the year that he collaborated with <a href="http://www.dougpayne.com/bio.htm">Gabor Szabo</a> and came up with the immortal <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=993074&s=143441&i=992987">Breezin'</a>. Bobby also began working with <a href="http://www.phattadatta.com/">Sly Stone</a>, and appeared on his groundbreaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_a_Riot_Goin'_On">There's a Riot Going On</a> album. It was Sly who convinced him to lose the suit, and came up with the idea for the cool cover shot on his first UA album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000002TQ6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_olp_9?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1197396275&sr=8-9">Communication</a>. In many ways, this was the record that kind of defined what Womack, and much of black music in the seventies, was all about. The title track would hit the R&amp;B top forty, but the next single off the album, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=763037">That's The Way I Feel About 'Cha</a>, became his biggest hit yet, climbing to #2 R&amp;B in December of 1971.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17Ab1hg8VI/AAAAAAAACF8/b3rS5NTS4-M/s1600-h/Understanding.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp3.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17Ab1hg8VI/AAAAAAAACF8/b3rS5NTS4-M/s200/Understanding.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142759408960336210"></a>His next album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Bobby-Womack/dp/B000002TQ9/ref=pd_bxgy_m_text_b">Understanding</a>, was released in 1972. Just a fantastic record, Bobby Womack's genius is fully realized here for the first time. Establishing him as the R&amp;B superstar Sam Cooke had envisioned he was destined to become, there was no turning back. One of the last albums to be recorded at American before Moman closed it down, it was produced by Womack himself, and it shows. Two 45s were taken from the album, resulting in no less than three chart hits.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17EbFhg8WI/AAAAAAAACGE/9e-aP_OlURs/s1600-h/UA+50902.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://bp0.blogger.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/R17EbFhg8WI/AAAAAAAACGE/9e-aP_OlURs/s200/UA+50902.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142763794121945442"></a>The first of these, the timeless <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=763139&s=143441&i=762855">Woman's Gotta Have It</a>, became Bobby's first #1 hit in April of 1972.

His courageous road trips with Ike Turner in the deep South in the early fifties changed the World. He and his brothers were the first to cut B.B. King and Etta James and, from their base out in Los Angeles, they left their mark on the history of R&B and Rock & Roll for decades.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D7ylG3duq5w/UsLO1CaMMbI/AAAAAAAAJJA/JvZilfinrgk/s1600/MODERN+994.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D7ylG3duq5w/UsLO1CaMMbI/AAAAAAAAJJA/JvZilfinrgk/s200/MODERN+994.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=Pb3a5fcb493f54d2a201d53625f19861fZ1x4R1REamF0&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=000099&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFFF00&amp;bc=000000&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap25" height="20" width="106" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pb3a5fcb493f54d2a201d53625f19861fZ1x4R1REamF0.mp3">I Want You</a><br /><br />This great B Side we have here (the flip of 1956 top 5 R&B hit, <a href="http://youtu.be/oZZ8QEtK3jk">Stranded In The Jungle</a>) demonstrates, I think, the quality of the music they produced. The Cadets (who the Biharis also cut as The Jacks), came up out of the same West Coast Doo-Wop scene as The Robins... the group Lieber & Stoller reinvented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coasters">The Coasters</a> - as a matter of fact, the lead singer on here, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/03/news/mn-60652">Will 'Dub' Jones</a>, would go on to join The Coasters himself and become one of the most recognizable voices in early Rock & Roll.<br /><br />Despite repeated efforts to influence the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame to induct Joe Bihari while he was still alive, it didn't happen. Joe died on November 28th. The list of 'inductees' was released on December 17th...

Just great stuff, man. For whatever reason, this one struggled to make it into the top fifty, and she left the group 1n 1975. As Shelbra Deane, she would chart a couple of times in the late seventies, and make some disco singles for Henry Stone after that, but I think it's her towering work with The Soul Children that will live on forever.

His courageous road trips with Ike Turner in the deep South in the early fifties changed the World. He and his brothers were the first to cut B.B. King and Etta James and, from their base out in Los Angeles, they left their mark on the history of R&B and Rock & Roll for decades.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D7ylG3duq5w/UsLO1CaMMbI/AAAAAAAAJJA/JvZilfinrgk/s1600/MODERN+994.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D7ylG3duq5w/UsLO1CaMMbI/AAAAAAAAJJA/JvZilfinrgk/s200/MODERN+994.jpg"></a></div><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=Pb3a5fcb493f54d2a201d53625f19861fZ1x4R1REamF0&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=000099&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFFF00&amp;bc=000000&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap25" height="20" width="106" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pb3a5fcb493f54d2a201d53625f19861fZ1x4R1REamF0.mp3">I Want You</a><br /><br />This great B Side we have here (the flip of 1956 top 5 R&B hit, <a href="http://youtu.be/oZZ8QEtK3jk">Stranded In The Jungle</a>) demonstrates, I think, the quality of the music they produced. The Cadets (who the Biharis also cut as The Jacks), came up out of the same West Coast Doo-Wop scene as The Robins... the group Lieber & Stoller reinvented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coasters">The Coasters</a> - as a matter of fact, the lead singer on here, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/03/news/mn-60652">Will 'Dub' Jones</a>, would go on to join The Coasters himself and become one of the most recognizable voices in early Rock & Roll.<br /><br />Despite repeated efforts to influence the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame to induct Joe Bihari while he was still alive, it didn't happen. Joe died on November 28th. The list of 'inductees' was released on December 17th...

Just great stuff, man. For whatever reason, this one struggled to make it into the top fifty, and she left the group 1n 1975. As Shelbra Deane, she would chart a couple of times in the late seventies, and make some disco singles for Henry Stone after that, but I think it's her towering work with The Soul Children that will live on forever.

Previously thought to have been lost forever, it was Ridgley who helped to uncover them tucked in a closet in a small town just outside of New Orleans. To Rounder's eternal credit, they appreciated what they had, and began an ambitious re-issue campaign that included 'best of' compilations on both Ric and Ron, and full LPs on the labels' biggest stars, Ridgley and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2009/03/eddie-bo-lets-let-it-roll-chess-1900.html">Eddie Bo</a>.

By sheer osmosis, she couldn't help but become immersed in this incredible music I was listening to, and through it all she latched on to one song, this amazing record we have here today. She would rewind the cassette and play it over and over... years later, when my second daughter was born, she wanted to name her 'Heavenly' (although cooler heads prevailed, and she was named after my Grandmother - something I swear she holds against me to this day!). What I'm getting at here is that this B-side is one that has remained central to our life together, and never fails to bring me back to those sunny days.

He was there in Memphis at Sunbeam Mitchell's Club Handy when it all began, and he lived there in Memphis until the day he died, same as he ever was. An absolute giant of R&B, his was one of the last great voices at the heart of Black American Music. His name was a mainstay on the R&B charts for four decades, and he never stopped performing, working wherever and whenever he got the chance.<br /><br />The music he created was deep, in every sense of the word. This awesome record we have here, the flip of 1961 monster hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turn-On-Your-Love-Light/dp/B000WLLA3S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1372444053&sr=8-2&keywords=Turn+On+Your+Love+Light" target=_blank">Turn On Your Love Light</a>, just knocks me out. Bobby's smoke-filled velvet vocals fill the room while Wayne Bennett's impeccable guitar work and Joe Scott's mournful arrangement bring it on home. A contemporary of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/sam-cooke-trouble-blues-rca-8803.html" target=_blank">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2009/02/ray-charles-careless-love-abc-paramount.html" target=_blank">Ray Charles</a>, he contributed as much (if not more) to the evolution of Soul music as either one of them. So much more than a 'Blues' singer, I don't think mainstream America ever truly appreciated how great he really was.<br /><br />Maybe now they will.<br /> ____________________________________________<br /><br /> <i>...reprinted below are a couple of other posts I did on Bobby over the years:</i><br /><br /><b>2/13/06:</b><br /><br /> <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/DUKE%20464.2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/320/DUKE%20464.2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><iframe src="https://www.audioblog.com/playweb?audioid=Pc4b9b44885a77eccd07ef442804b190cZ1x4R1REYmF8&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;gateway=http://www.audioblog.com/playlist&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scroll="no" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a href="http://www.audioblog.com/export/Pc4b9b44885a77eccd07ef442804b190cZ1x4R1REYmF8.mp3" rel="enclosure">I've Just Got To Forget About You</a><br /><br />This past January 22nd would have been <a href="http://www.songsofsamcooke.com/biography1.htm">Sam Cooke</a>'s 75th birthday.

He actually picked cotton in the fields, and didn't bother going to school much.<br /><br />When the family moved to Memphis in 1947, he joined a local Gospel group called The Miniatures that sang in area churches. It wasn't long, however, before the young Bland was drawn in by the whole blues scene that was happening down on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_Street">Beale Street</a>. In addition to working in a local garage, he began parking cars down behind the Palace Theatre, and soon became a regular fixture. He would compete in the amateur shows staged by <a href="http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Rufus%20Thomas.html">Rufus Thomas</a> most every Wednesday, and came to be known as one of the <a href="http://www.duvigneaud.net/Beale_Streeters.html">Beale Streeters</a>, a loose collection of local guys that would include <a href="http://www.bbking.com/default.asp">B.B.

It was Mitchell that got Bobby a spot on Rufus Thomas' radio show on WDIA. This got him noticed by <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records.htm">Sam Phillips</a>, who had just started recording local acts at his Memphis Recording Service. He did a session on Bobby for Chess Records in 1951, and early the next year, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Turner">Ike Turner</a> produced four sides for Modern Records at the studio, none of which made much of a splash.<br /><br />Later in 1952, Bobby signed with Duke Records, a new label that had been started up by WDIA DJ Dave Mattis. They would release one single, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Lovin' Blues</a>, before Bobby was drafted into the Army. The record became somewhat of a regional hit while he was away, and Duke recorded his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Army Blues</a> in 1953 while he was home on leave.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/RobeyJohnson.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/RobeyJohnson.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://www.yearoftheblues.org/features.asp?id=%7B024252EB-DB9F-447B-B3AA-CF3CE5C231CA%7D&type=Feature">Don Robey</a>, meanwhile, was busy building his own little empire. He had opened a club called The Bronze Peacock in Houston, Texas in 1945 that became the premier showcase for Jazz and R&B in the region. He began managing local artists like <a href="http://www.gatemouth.com/bio.htm">Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown</a>, and would open a record store in 1947. It wasn't long before he realized there was real money to be made in the record business, and in 1949 he formed Peacock Records, building his own recording studio and record pressing plant adjacent to the club. He began building an impressive roster of Gospel and Blues talent, and his records became huge sellers in the Southern market. Robey had the reputation of running his business "like a plantation", often making his point with a pistol he kept strapped to his leg. In addition to recording and pressing his own records, he would pay writers a few dollars up front, then claim songwriting credit and publishing rights for himself. He also made sure his artists were represented by his own Buffalo Booking Agency, run by partner <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Don%20Robey:1927176370:page=biography">Evelyn Johnson</a> (pictured here with Robey). He had all the angles covered. Ever on the lookout for a new source of income, Don had his eye on Memphis.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/Bobby%20%26%20Elvis.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/Bobby%20%26%20Elvis.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He made a deal with Dave Mattis, giving Duke a much needed infusion of cash, and by late 1953 Robey had forced him out, becoming sole proprietor of Duke-Peacock Records. When Bobby was discharged from the service in 1955, the Memphis he knew was no more. Sam Phillip's own <a href="http://www.sunrecords.com/">Sun Records</a> had found its fair haired boy, and his contract with Duke was now owned by someone he'd never met somewhere in Texas.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/bland.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/bland.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He and Robey actually got along well together (he often said it was better than pushing a plow...), and he rejoined old friend Junior Parker as part of a package called Blues Consolidated that Buffalo Booking had put together. Playing more than 300 gigs a year, they criss-crossed the country, just smokin' it up! Duke would record them whenever they came through Houston, and so kept a steady stream of "product" out there for sale. Most of these early sides featured the great <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2000-05-04/music2.html">Clarence Hollimon</a> on guitar, but it was his old Memphis homeboy <a href="http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/pat_hare.htm">Pat Hare</a> (who would later go on to become a member of <a href="http://www.muddywaters.com/home.html"?>Muddy Waters</a>' band before being sentenced to 99 years in prison for killing his girlfriend and the cop she called on him...!) that drove his first national hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Farther Up The Road</a> all the way to number one on the R&B charts in 1957.<br /><br />The success of this record (as well as his subsequent top ten hit, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Little Boy Blue</a>) enabled Bobby to set out on his own, forming the incredible band that would stay with him for the next ten years. It would include Wayne Bennett on the guitar, Teddy Reynolds on the piano, Hamp Simmons on bass, <a href="http://www.funky-stuff.com/drummers/starksInterview.htm">Jabo Starks</a> (future funky drummer for The JBs) on the drums, along with a fat horn section led by trumpeter Joe Scott. It was Scott's arrangements that brought Bobby's music to the next level, essentially creating his unique sound.<br /><br />He continued to top the R&B charts, while staying out on the road 50 weeks of every year. The band was playing all the popular package shows of the day alongside people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/jackie_wilson.htm">Jackie Wilson</a>. Bobby understood, as they did, the power of the female audience, and each night was like a contest to just "take 'em out"!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059T1U/ref=m_art_li_3/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/bobbybluebland2sy.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The release of the absolutely amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059T1U/ref=m_art_li_3/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Two Steps From The Blues</a> in 1961 collected much of his work from this period into a cohesive whole that still stands as one of the greatest albums ever.

It is this very designation (thought up by us genre-driven white people) that, in my opinion, has tended to marginalize people like Bobby, <a href="http://www.littlemilton.com/welcome.html">Little Milton</a>, and <a href="http://www.mmguide.musicmatch.com/artist/artist.cgi?ARTISTID=345281&TMPL=LONG#bio">Z.Z. Hill</a>. I mean, he's like "too soul" to be taken seriously by the blues "purists", while being often overlooked by the soul crowd as having too much "blues"... or something. Whatever. His own people know the deal. He has entered the R&B charts an incredible 63 times, placing no less than 25 records in the top ten.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/CaliBBB.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/CaliBBB.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>By the end of the 1960s, Bobby's drinking (over two quarts a day) caught up with him, and his band split up. The loss of Joe Scott as his arranger took its toll, and his early seventies output was inconsistent. In 1973, Robey sold Duke to ABC Records, which was later taken over by MCA. He would re-unite with former Beale Streeter B.B. King for a few mid-70s outings but, for the most part, a combination of record company indifference and changing times led to some truly middle-of-the-road material.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/9_4_full.0.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/9_4_full.0.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Bobby signed with good ol' Malaco Records in 1984 and got back to his southern soul roots. The release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001KZC/ref=m_art_li_9/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Members Only</a> the following year put him right back in the R&B top 20 where he belonged. He would go on to release over 15 albums for them over the next twenty years, highlighted by great songs like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001L0D/102-0474604-4187342?v=glance&n=5174">Take Off Your Shoes</a> and <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Bobby-Bland/Item/116/Years-Of-Tears.php">I Just Tripped On A Piece Of Your Broken Heart</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/BENZ89B.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/BENZ89B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Throughout all of this, Bobby continued to tour constantly, playing the same "chitlin' circuit" clubs he always had. I was lucky enough to experience this first hand during Carnival in New Orleans in 1989. My brother and I, two dumb white guys festooned in Mardi-Gras beads, stumbled into the Benz Lounge on Louisiana Avenue and were just blown away! Bobby and his band (with Wayne Bennett back on the guitar), just brought the house down around us... The sheer energy of this performance, with Bobby working the crowd in a small club setting, was an experience I'll never forget...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/blandcib2.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/blandcib2.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I saw him again about two weeks ago, opening for <a href="http://www.drjohn.org/">Dr. John</a> at a theatre in New Jersey. About half the crowd was made up of well-dressed African-Americans in their sixties and seventies... Bobby's audience that has grown old along with him. People that remember Sam Cooke... that were a part of the struggle for civil rights. A generation that is passing before our very eyes. <br /><br />Bobby's amazing voice, still a powerful instrument, spoke to the soul of everyone in the room. He had us in the palm of his hand.<br /><br />Talk about a living legend, man.<br /><br />____________________________________________<br /><br /><b>8/8/10</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF9R4Kehn0I/AAAAAAAAGYc/K00Qei-3yNQ/s1600/DUKE+185.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 317px; height: 320px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF9R4Kehn0I/AAAAAAAAGYc/K00Qei-3yNQ/s320/DUKE+185.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503207294996946754"></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P8a0e1845ffbd6c7fb114042e3086ce18Z1x4R1REZ2R2&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P8a0e1845ffbd6c7fb114042e3086ce18Z1x4R1REZ2R2.mp3">Loan A Helping Hand</a><script type="text/javascript" src="https://mediaplayer.yahoo.com/js"></script><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF_9vlPI42I/AAAAAAAAGYk/_izNJgHHies/s1600/mm.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 352px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF_9vlPI42I/AAAAAAAAGYk/_izNJgHHies/s400/mm.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503396263561323362"></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TGADTMLGsVI/AAAAAAAAGYs/diGn0nd5QzI/s1600/7289361_550_art_R0.jpeg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 152px; height: 200px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TGADTMLGsVI/AAAAAAAAGYs/diGn0nd5QzI/s200/7289361_550_art_R0.jpeg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503402372866945362"></a>In 1984 <a href="http://darkendofthestreet.blogspot.com/2005/10/dan-greer-nathan-lewis.html">Dan Greer</a> and <a href="http://elvispelvis.com/fredford.htm">Fred Ford</a> got together and formed an organization named <b>'Friends United To Preserve Musical Heritage International'</b>.

He was there in Memphis at Sunbeam Mitchell's Club Handy when it all began, and he lived there in Memphis until the day he died, same as he ever was. An absolute giant of R&B, his was one of the last great voices at the heart of Black American Music. His name was a mainstay on the R&B charts for four decades, and he never stopped performing, working wherever and whenever he got the chance.<br /><br />The music he created was deep, in every sense of the word. This awesome record we have here, the flip of 1961 monster hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turn-On-Your-Love-Light/dp/B000WLLA3S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1372444053&sr=8-2&keywords=Turn+On+Your+Love+Light" target=_blank">Turn On Your Love Light</a>, just knocks me out. Bobby's smoke-filled velvet vocals fill the room while Wayne Bennett's impeccable guitar work and Joe Scott's mournful arrangement bring it on home. A contemporary of <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/01/sam-cooke-trouble-blues-rca-8803.html" target=_blank">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2009/02/ray-charles-careless-love-abc-paramount.html" target=_blank">Ray Charles</a>, he contributed as much (if not more) to the evolution of Soul music as either one of them. So much more than a 'Blues' singer, I don't think mainstream America ever truly appreciated how great he really was.<br /><br />Maybe now they will.<br /> ____________________________________________<br /><br /> <i>...reprinted below are a couple of other posts I did on Bobby over the years:</i><br /><br /><b>2/13/06:</b><br /><br /> <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/DUKE%20464.2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/320/DUKE%20464.2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><iframe src="https://www.audioblog.com/playweb?audioid=Pc4b9b44885a77eccd07ef442804b190cZ1x4R1REYmF8&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;gateway=http://www.audioblog.com/playlist&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scroll="no" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a href="http://www.audioblog.com/export/Pc4b9b44885a77eccd07ef442804b190cZ1x4R1REYmF8.mp3" rel="enclosure">I've Just Got To Forget About You</a><br /><br />This past January 22nd would have been <a href="http://www.songsofsamcooke.com/biography1.htm">Sam Cooke</a>'s 75th birthday.

He actually picked cotton in the fields, and didn't bother going to school much.<br /><br />When the family moved to Memphis in 1947, he joined a local Gospel group called The Miniatures that sang in area churches. It wasn't long, however, before the young Bland was drawn in by the whole blues scene that was happening down on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_Street">Beale Street</a>. In addition to working in a local garage, he began parking cars down behind the Palace Theatre, and soon became a regular fixture. He would compete in the amateur shows staged by <a href="http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Rufus%20Thomas.html">Rufus Thomas</a> most every Wednesday, and came to be known as one of the <a href="http://www.duvigneaud.net/Beale_Streeters.html">Beale Streeters</a>, a loose collection of local guys that would include <a href="http://www.bbking.com/default.asp">B.B.

It was Mitchell that got Bobby a spot on Rufus Thomas' radio show on WDIA. This got him noticed by <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records.htm">Sam Phillips</a>, who had just started recording local acts at his Memphis Recording Service. He did a session on Bobby for Chess Records in 1951, and early the next year, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Turner">Ike Turner</a> produced four sides for Modern Records at the studio, none of which made much of a splash.<br /><br />Later in 1952, Bobby signed with Duke Records, a new label that had been started up by WDIA DJ Dave Mattis. They would release one single, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Lovin' Blues</a>, before Bobby was drafted into the Army. The record became somewhat of a regional hit while he was away, and Duke recorded his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Army Blues</a> in 1953 while he was home on leave.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/RobeyJohnson.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/RobeyJohnson.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a href="http://www.yearoftheblues.org/features.asp?id=%7B024252EB-DB9F-447B-B3AA-CF3CE5C231CA%7D&type=Feature">Don Robey</a>, meanwhile, was busy building his own little empire. He had opened a club called The Bronze Peacock in Houston, Texas in 1945 that became the premier showcase for Jazz and R&B in the region. He began managing local artists like <a href="http://www.gatemouth.com/bio.htm">Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown</a>, and would open a record store in 1947. It wasn't long before he realized there was real money to be made in the record business, and in 1949 he formed Peacock Records, building his own recording studio and record pressing plant adjacent to the club. He began building an impressive roster of Gospel and Blues talent, and his records became huge sellers in the Southern market. Robey had the reputation of running his business "like a plantation", often making his point with a pistol he kept strapped to his leg. In addition to recording and pressing his own records, he would pay writers a few dollars up front, then claim songwriting credit and publishing rights for himself. He also made sure his artists were represented by his own Buffalo Booking Agency, run by partner <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Don%20Robey:1927176370:page=biography">Evelyn Johnson</a> (pictured here with Robey). He had all the angles covered. Ever on the lookout for a new source of income, Don had his eye on Memphis.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/Bobby%20%26%20Elvis.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/Bobby%20%26%20Elvis.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He made a deal with Dave Mattis, giving Duke a much needed infusion of cash, and by late 1953 Robey had forced him out, becoming sole proprietor of Duke-Peacock Records. When Bobby was discharged from the service in 1955, the Memphis he knew was no more. Sam Phillip's own <a href="http://www.sunrecords.com/">Sun Records</a> had found its fair haired boy, and his contract with Duke was now owned by someone he'd never met somewhere in Texas.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/bland.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/bland.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>He and Robey actually got along well together (he often said it was better than pushing a plow...), and he rejoined old friend Junior Parker as part of a package called Blues Consolidated that Buffalo Booking had put together. Playing more than 300 gigs a year, they criss-crossed the country, just smokin' it up! Duke would record them whenever they came through Houston, and so kept a steady stream of "product" out there for sale. Most of these early sides featured the great <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2000-05-04/music2.html">Clarence Hollimon</a> on guitar, but it was his old Memphis homeboy <a href="http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/pat_hare.htm">Pat Hare</a> (who would later go on to become a member of <a href="http://www.muddywaters.com/home.html"?>Muddy Waters</a>' band before being sentenced to 99 years in prison for killing his girlfriend and the cop she called on him...!) that drove his first national hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Farther Up The Road</a> all the way to number one on the R&B charts in 1957.<br /><br />The success of this record (as well as his subsequent top ten hit, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K32H/ref=m_art_li_4/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Little Boy Blue</a>) enabled Bobby to set out on his own, forming the incredible band that would stay with him for the next ten years. It would include Wayne Bennett on the guitar, Teddy Reynolds on the piano, Hamp Simmons on bass, <a href="http://www.funky-stuff.com/drummers/starksInterview.htm">Jabo Starks</a> (future funky drummer for The JBs) on the drums, along with a fat horn section led by trumpeter Joe Scott. It was Scott's arrangements that brought Bobby's music to the next level, essentially creating his unique sound.<br /><br />He continued to top the R&B charts, while staying out on the road 50 weeks of every year. The band was playing all the popular package shows of the day alongside people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/jackie_wilson.htm">Jackie Wilson</a>. Bobby understood, as they did, the power of the female audience, and each night was like a contest to just "take 'em out"!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059T1U/ref=m_art_li_3/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/bobbybluebland2sy.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The release of the absolutely amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059T1U/ref=m_art_li_3/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Two Steps From The Blues</a> in 1961 collected much of his work from this period into a cohesive whole that still stands as one of the greatest albums ever.

It is this very designation (thought up by us genre-driven white people) that, in my opinion, has tended to marginalize people like Bobby, <a href="http://www.littlemilton.com/welcome.html">Little Milton</a>, and <a href="http://www.mmguide.musicmatch.com/artist/artist.cgi?ARTISTID=345281&TMPL=LONG#bio">Z.Z. Hill</a>. I mean, he's like "too soul" to be taken seriously by the blues "purists", while being often overlooked by the soul crowd as having too much "blues"... or something. Whatever. His own people know the deal. He has entered the R&B charts an incredible 63 times, placing no less than 25 records in the top ten.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/CaliBBB.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/CaliBBB.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>By the end of the 1960s, Bobby's drinking (over two quarts a day) caught up with him, and his band split up. The loss of Joe Scott as his arranger took its toll, and his early seventies output was inconsistent. In 1973, Robey sold Duke to ABC Records, which was later taken over by MCA. He would re-unite with former Beale Streeter B.B. King for a few mid-70s outings but, for the most part, a combination of record company indifference and changing times led to some truly middle-of-the-road material.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/9_4_full.0.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/9_4_full.0.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Bobby signed with good ol' Malaco Records in 1984 and got back to his southern soul roots. The release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001KZC/ref=m_art_li_9/102-0474604-4187342?s=music&v=glance&n=5174">Members Only</a> the following year put him right back in the R&B top 20 where he belonged. He would go on to release over 15 albums for them over the next twenty years, highlighted by great songs like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001L0D/102-0474604-4187342?v=glance&n=5174">Take Off Your Shoes</a> and <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Bobby-Bland/Item/116/Years-Of-Tears.php">I Just Tripped On A Piece Of Your Broken Heart</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/BENZ89B.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/BENZ89B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Throughout all of this, Bobby continued to tour constantly, playing the same "chitlin' circuit" clubs he always had. I was lucky enough to experience this first hand during Carnival in New Orleans in 1989. My brother and I, two dumb white guys festooned in Mardi-Gras beads, stumbled into the Benz Lounge on Louisiana Avenue and were just blown away! Bobby and his band (with Wayne Bennett back on the guitar), just brought the house down around us... The sheer energy of this performance, with Bobby working the crowd in a small club setting, was an experience I'll never forget...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/1600/blandcib2.JPG.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3954/945/200/blandcib2.JPG.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I saw him again about two weeks ago, opening for <a href="http://www.drjohn.org/">Dr. John</a> at a theatre in New Jersey. About half the crowd was made up of well-dressed African-Americans in their sixties and seventies... Bobby's audience that has grown old along with him. People that remember Sam Cooke... that were a part of the struggle for civil rights. A generation that is passing before our very eyes. <br /><br />Bobby's amazing voice, still a powerful instrument, spoke to the soul of everyone in the room. He had us in the palm of his hand.<br /><br />Talk about a living legend, man.<br /><br />____________________________________________<br /><br /><b>8/8/10</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF9R4Kehn0I/AAAAAAAAGYc/K00Qei-3yNQ/s1600/DUKE+185.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 317px; height: 320px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF9R4Kehn0I/AAAAAAAAGYc/K00Qei-3yNQ/s320/DUKE+185.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503207294996946754"></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=P8a0e1845ffbd6c7fb114042e3086ce18Z1x4R1REZ2R2&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P8a0e1845ffbd6c7fb114042e3086ce18Z1x4R1REZ2R2.mp3">Loan A Helping Hand</a><script type="text/javascript" src="https://mediaplayer.yahoo.com/js"></script><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF_9vlPI42I/AAAAAAAAGYk/_izNJgHHies/s1600/mm.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 352px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TF_9vlPI42I/AAAAAAAAGYk/_izNJgHHies/s400/mm.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503396263561323362"></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TGADTMLGsVI/AAAAAAAAGYs/diGn0nd5QzI/s1600/7289361_550_art_R0.jpeg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 152px; height: 200px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rAHeUmcEWZM/TGADTMLGsVI/AAAAAAAAGYs/diGn0nd5QzI/s200/7289361_550_art_R0.jpeg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503402372866945362"></a>In 1984 <a href="http://darkendofthestreet.blogspot.com/2005/10/dan-greer-nathan-lewis.html">Dan Greer</a> and <a href="http://elvispelvis.com/fredford.htm">Fred Ford</a> got together and formed an organization named <b>'Friends United To Preserve Musical Heritage International'</b>.

I don't think you can say enough about this man's importance in the development of this music. Known primarily for his incredible songwriting skills, his career as a performer is often forgotten. This emotional gem we have here was released by <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/08/willie-mitchell-woodchoppers-ball-hi.html" target="_blank">Willie Mitchell</a> as a B Side twice, once 1n 1967 and again in 1972... that's how good it is. You can feel George put his heart and soul on the line, just as he did with everything he touched. From Memphis and Muscle Shoals, to his longstanding position as the poet-laureate of Malaco Music, George Jackson's gentle genius defined what it meant to be a Soul Man.<br /><br />He will never be replaced.<br /> ____________________________________________<br /><br /> There is an excellent overview of George's recording career over at <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists_2012/J/george_jackson/index.php" target="_blank">Deep Soul Heaven</a>, and re-printed below is an appreciation of him I wrote back in 2006:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/276475/FAME%201457.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/801804/FAME%201457.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=Pe4332403abda7a4100893d75b7d99ae5Z1x4R1REY2Z9&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pe4332403abda7a4100893d75b7d99ae5Z1x4R1REY2Z9.mp3">My Desires Are Getting The Best Of Me</a><br /><br />As the final installment of our 'fame fest', I thought we'd focus on the quiet genius behind so much great southern soul, <a href="http://www.soulcellar.co.uk/georgejackson/GeorgeJacksonDiscography.htm">George Jackson</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/320017/g%20jackson%2060s.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/349186/g%20jackson%2060s.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Born in <a href="http://www.bbking.com/default.asp">B.B. King</a>'s Indianola, George grew up on the river in Greenville, Mississippi. When <a href="http://www.iketurner.com/">Ike Turner</a> rumbled down Highway 61 from Clarksdale, the teenaged Jackson went to see him and showed him some of the songs he'd been writing. Ike was impressed, and brought George downriver to New Orleans to record at <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cosimo-matassa">Cosimo Matassa</a>'s studio in 1963. His idol was <a href="http://members.tripod.com/clarkkauffman/">Sam Cooke</a> (as he was for most every other aspiring singer in those days), and the record they cut <b>Won't Nobody Cha-Cha With Me</b> was an attempt to cash in on the recent Cooke-inspired 'cha-cha' craze. Released on Turner's Prann label, the single sank like a stone.<br /><br />Jackson next moved to Memphis, and placed a couple of novelty type singles with the Dot and Doro labels through local impresarios Dorothy and John Hester. Also around this time, he recorded under the first of many pseudonyms, Louie Palmer, for Earl Forrest's Bootheel label in 1965. George's best friend in Memphis, <a href="http://www.lifeandsoulpromotions.co.uk/greer.htm">Dan Greer</a>, soon became his songwriting partner, and they formed their own short-lived label, Gre-Jac the following year. The label's only release, <b>You Didn't Know It But You Had Me</b>, was by 'George & Greer', and didn't sell much.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/711671/GOLDWAX%20312.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/463036/GOLDWAX%20312.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>As legend has it, George lived in a big old house in Memphis and the landlady let him use her broken-down piano to write songs. He and Dan would spend most of every day working on material, and they were soon noticed by <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/quinton-claunch">Quinton Claunch</a> and 'Doc' Russell over at <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/goldwax.htm">Goldwax Records</a>. Claunch offered Jackson a contract as a songwriter for Goldwax, and one of the first tunes he contributed to the label, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7054332/a/Goldwax+Years.htm">Old Friend (You Asked Me If I Miss Her)</a> (Goldwax 312) became a local hit for the great <a href="http://keepingsoulalive.blogspot.com/2006/06/spencer-wiggins-goldwax-years-ace-cd.html">Spencer Wiggins</a> in 1966. In what was apparently part of the deal, Goldwax 313 was a re-release of the George & Greer single. It didn't sell this time either.<br /><br />George (and Dan) took to their duties at Goldwax, and soon had artists like Wiggins,<a href="v"> James Carr</a>, <a href="http://keepingsoulalive.blogspot.com/2005/09/willie-walker-at-goldwax-records-in.html">Willie Walker</a>, and <a href="http://soulshower.blogspot.com/2006/06/sweet-thing.html">The Ovations</a> gathered around the old piano as well, rehearsing the songs they wrote for them. George was a particular fan of Ovations' lead singer <a href="http://www.soulcellar.co.uk/louis/Ovations.html">Louis Williams</a>, and worked with the group often (although it remains unclear to me if he was ever actually a <i>member</i>). Goldwax didn't have its own studio, and would record whenever and wherever they could get the best deal. It was Dan and George's job to drive the singers to the recording dates, armed with whatever it took (like a bottle) to get the best performance. Jackson became the de-facto producer as well, often running through take after take until he was satisfied with the song. If George was happy, Quinton Claunch was happy too.<br /><br />George began working with Memphis legend <a href="http://www.williemitchell.com/">Willie Mitchell</a> around this time, and released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hi-45s-Collection-Vol-2/dp/B0000058ZI/sr=1-4/qid=1164952021/ref=sr_1_4/102-6924228-4999349?ie=UTF8&s=music">So Good to Me</a> on Hi in 1967. Mitchell was able to place a single with Decca the following year, under yet another name - 'Bart' Jackson. A demo George had recorded, <b>Cold Cold Love</b> was released on the Public label in 1968, but he had nothing to do with it.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/410228/FAME%201468.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/158789/FAME%201468.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Fame was one of the studios that Claunch had been using off and on, ever since James Carr's earliest sides for Goldwax in 1964. He began sending Jackson down there as well, along with Spencer Wiggins and his brother Percy. They recorded some great material, but Claunch folded the label before it was released. Rick Hall wasted no time, and signed George up as the new staff songwriter at Fame in 1969. Rick also recorded him as an artist for the house label, and today's cool record is The B side of his first Fame single, <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2006/12/george-jackson-find-em-fool-em-and.html">Find 'Em, Fool 'Em, And Forget 'Em</a> (now up on the <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2006/12/george-jackson-find-em-fool-em-and.html">A side</a>). Recorded right around the time the 'second' rhythm section left, I'm not sure if it's them or the 'Fame Gang' backing him up, all I know is that it's great! Co-written with his new running partner Raymond Moore, George is at his best here spinning yet another tale of the vagaries of love. His next (and last) single for the label, <b>That's How Much You Mean To Me</b>, would result in his first chart appearance when it cracked the R&B top 50 in the summer of 1970. Hall had secured the rights to the unreleased Goldwax recordings at this point, and when he put out Spencer Wiggins' rendition of Jackson composition <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7054332/a/Goldwax+Years.htm">Double Lovin'</a> later that year it broke the top 50 as well (Spencer's only chart hit). <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/621706/osmonds162839.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/797513/osmonds162839.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>When MGM sent floundering boy band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmonds">The Osmonds</a> down to Fame in 1971, they took a song George had originally written with the Jackson 5 in mind, <a href="http://www.superseventies.com/1971_5singles.html">One Bad Apple</a>, all the way to number one on the pop charts. The record would spend five weeks there, and become an international success (it even made #6 <i>R&B</i>!). The Osmonds were on top.

The company also backed a label he had formed with his old partner Dan Greer, <b>Sounds Of Memphis</b>. Back recording former Goldwax artists like The Ovations and Spencer Wiggins, they were producing some great music, but times had changed, and the records weren't selling. MGM promo man Eddie Ray believed in George's talent (even after his employer had moved on), and in addition to placing one single with Chess in 1975, he put out what many consider to be George's finest record, <b>Talking About The Love I Have For You/I Don't Need You No More</b> on his own ER label in 1976.<br /><br />By the late seventies, George had left Fame and began working with cross-town rivals <a href="http://www.muscleshoalssound.org/">Muscle Shoals Sound</a>. There was one 'disco' single released on the studio's short lived record label, but the main work was going on behind the scenes. Unknown to the general public, Jackson was hunkered down with what may just have been the best band in the world recording demos of the songs he was writing. The resulting tapes became legendary, and remained unheard for over twenty years (more on that in a moment). His work from this period included blockbusters like Bob Seger's <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2609">Old Time Rock & Roll</a> in 1978, and James Brown's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1610012&s=143441&i=1610003">It's Too Funky In Here</a> in '79.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/153358/MALACO%202079.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/238333/MALACO%202079.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>As we've <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/06/zz-hill-please-dont-let-our-good-thing.html">mentioned before</a>, Tommy Couch and Wolf Stephenson up at Malaco heard George's demos and selected a couple of tunes for their new signee <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/06/zz-hill-please-dont-let-our-good-thing.html">Z.Z. Hill</a>'s second album, <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Down Home</a> in 1981. Jackson composition <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Down Home Blues</a>, which Malaco refused to release as a single, was just <i>huge</i> and helped make the record the largest selling 'blues' album in history. When they released George's <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Cheatin' In The Next Room</a> as a single from the album in early 1982, it took off, spending five months on the R&B charts. On the basis of such unprecedented sales, Malaco hired Jackson as their new staff songwriter later that year. He still holds that position today, and has written countless fantastic songs for the label's soul stalwarts like <a href="http://bluescritic.com/DeniseLaSalle.html">Denise LaSalle</a>, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2005/12/little-milton-lovin-stick-stax-0148.html">Little Milton</a>, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/02/bobby-bland-ive-just-got-to-forget.html">Bobby Bland</a> and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/10/johnnie-taylor-soul-philosopher-love.html">Johnnie Taylor</a> (the Jackson penned <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=98030962&s=143441&i=98029570">Last Two Dollars</a> was a gigantic hit in 1996, and helped make Taylor's album <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=98030962&s=143441">Good Love</a> Malaco's biggest seller <i>ever</i>).<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/709227/100978954_4a84d5b0b5.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/366685/100978954_4a84d5b0b5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>George himself hadn't recorded much in the eighties, except for a few singles on local southern labels like Crosstown and Washataw.

George's demo tapes were included in the sale along with hundreds of other items. When <a href="http://www.grapevine-soul.com/index.htm">Grapevine Music</a> became the UK licensee for Malaco around the turn of the century, they began an ambitious search of their 'vaults'. Finding Jackson's Muscle Shoals demos intact and sounding just as good as the day they were recorded must have been like finding the Holy Grail.

I don't think you can say enough about this man's importance in the development of this music. Known primarily for his incredible songwriting skills, his career as a performer is often forgotten. This emotional gem we have here was released by <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2007/08/willie-mitchell-woodchoppers-ball-hi.html" target="_blank">Willie Mitchell</a> as a B Side twice, once 1n 1967 and again in 1972... that's how good it is. You can feel George put his heart and soul on the line, just as he did with everything he touched. From Memphis and Muscle Shoals, to his longstanding position as the poet-laureate of Malaco Music, George Jackson's gentle genius defined what it meant to be a Soul Man.<br /><br />He will never be replaced.<br /> ____________________________________________<br /><br /> There is an excellent overview of George's recording career over at <a href="http://www.sirshambling.com/artists_2012/J/george_jackson/index.php" target="_blank">Deep Soul Heaven</a>, and re-printed below is an appreciation of him I wrote back in 2006:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/276475/FAME%201457.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/320/801804/FAME%201457.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><iframe src="https://www.hipcast.com/playweb?audioid=Pe4332403abda7a4100893d75b7d99ae5Z1x4R1REY2Z9&amp;buffer=5&amp;fc=FFFFFF&amp;pc=FF0000&amp;kc=FFCC33&amp;bc=66FF66&amp;brand=1&amp;player=ap24" height="20" width="206" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/Pe4332403abda7a4100893d75b7d99ae5Z1x4R1REY2Z9.mp3">My Desires Are Getting The Best Of Me</a><br /><br />As the final installment of our 'fame fest', I thought we'd focus on the quiet genius behind so much great southern soul, <a href="http://www.soulcellar.co.uk/georgejackson/GeorgeJacksonDiscography.htm">George Jackson</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/320017/g%20jackson%2060s.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/349186/g%20jackson%2060s.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Born in <a href="http://www.bbking.com/default.asp">B.B. King</a>'s Indianola, George grew up on the river in Greenville, Mississippi. When <a href="http://www.iketurner.com/">Ike Turner</a> rumbled down Highway 61 from Clarksdale, the teenaged Jackson went to see him and showed him some of the songs he'd been writing. Ike was impressed, and brought George downriver to New Orleans to record at <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cosimo-matassa">Cosimo Matassa</a>'s studio in 1963. His idol was <a href="http://members.tripod.com/clarkkauffman/">Sam Cooke</a> (as he was for most every other aspiring singer in those days), and the record they cut <b>Won't Nobody Cha-Cha With Me</b> was an attempt to cash in on the recent Cooke-inspired 'cha-cha' craze. Released on Turner's Prann label, the single sank like a stone.<br /><br />Jackson next moved to Memphis, and placed a couple of novelty type singles with the Dot and Doro labels through local impresarios Dorothy and John Hester. Also around this time, he recorded under the first of many pseudonyms, Louie Palmer, for Earl Forrest's Bootheel label in 1965. George's best friend in Memphis, <a href="http://www.lifeandsoulpromotions.co.uk/greer.htm">Dan Greer</a>, soon became his songwriting partner, and they formed their own short-lived label, Gre-Jac the following year. The label's only release, <b>You Didn't Know It But You Had Me</b>, was by 'George & Greer', and didn't sell much.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/711671/GOLDWAX%20312.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/463036/GOLDWAX%20312.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>As legend has it, George lived in a big old house in Memphis and the landlady let him use her broken-down piano to write songs. He and Dan would spend most of every day working on material, and they were soon noticed by <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/quinton-claunch">Quinton Claunch</a> and 'Doc' Russell over at <a href="http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/goldwax.htm">Goldwax Records</a>. Claunch offered Jackson a contract as a songwriter for Goldwax, and one of the first tunes he contributed to the label, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7054332/a/Goldwax+Years.htm">Old Friend (You Asked Me If I Miss Her)</a> (Goldwax 312) became a local hit for the great <a href="http://keepingsoulalive.blogspot.com/2006/06/spencer-wiggins-goldwax-years-ace-cd.html">Spencer Wiggins</a> in 1966. In what was apparently part of the deal, Goldwax 313 was a re-release of the George & Greer single. It didn't sell this time either.<br /><br />George (and Dan) took to their duties at Goldwax, and soon had artists like Wiggins,<a href="v"> James Carr</a>, <a href="http://keepingsoulalive.blogspot.com/2005/09/willie-walker-at-goldwax-records-in.html">Willie Walker</a>, and <a href="http://soulshower.blogspot.com/2006/06/sweet-thing.html">The Ovations</a> gathered around the old piano as well, rehearsing the songs they wrote for them. George was a particular fan of Ovations' lead singer <a href="http://www.soulcellar.co.uk/louis/Ovations.html">Louis Williams</a>, and worked with the group often (although it remains unclear to me if he was ever actually a <i>member</i>). Goldwax didn't have its own studio, and would record whenever and wherever they could get the best deal. It was Dan and George's job to drive the singers to the recording dates, armed with whatever it took (like a bottle) to get the best performance. Jackson became the de-facto producer as well, often running through take after take until he was satisfied with the song. If George was happy, Quinton Claunch was happy too.<br /><br />George began working with Memphis legend <a href="http://www.williemitchell.com/">Willie Mitchell</a> around this time, and released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hi-45s-Collection-Vol-2/dp/B0000058ZI/sr=1-4/qid=1164952021/ref=sr_1_4/102-6924228-4999349?ie=UTF8&s=music">So Good to Me</a> on Hi in 1967. Mitchell was able to place a single with Decca the following year, under yet another name - 'Bart' Jackson. A demo George had recorded, <b>Cold Cold Love</b> was released on the Public label in 1968, but he had nothing to do with it.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/410228/FAME%201468.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/158789/FAME%201468.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Fame was one of the studios that Claunch had been using off and on, ever since James Carr's earliest sides for Goldwax in 1964. He began sending Jackson down there as well, along with Spencer Wiggins and his brother Percy. They recorded some great material, but Claunch folded the label before it was released. Rick Hall wasted no time, and signed George up as the new staff songwriter at Fame in 1969. Rick also recorded him as an artist for the house label, and today's cool record is The B side of his first Fame single, <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2006/12/george-jackson-find-em-fool-em-and.html">Find 'Em, Fool 'Em, And Forget 'Em</a> (now up on the <a href="http://redkelly2.blogspot.com/2006/12/george-jackson-find-em-fool-em-and.html">A side</a>). Recorded right around the time the 'second' rhythm section left, I'm not sure if it's them or the 'Fame Gang' backing him up, all I know is that it's great! Co-written with his new running partner Raymond Moore, George is at his best here spinning yet another tale of the vagaries of love. His next (and last) single for the label, <b>That's How Much You Mean To Me</b>, would result in his first chart appearance when it cracked the R&B top 50 in the summer of 1970. Hall had secured the rights to the unreleased Goldwax recordings at this point, and when he put out Spencer Wiggins' rendition of Jackson composition <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7054332/a/Goldwax+Years.htm">Double Lovin'</a> later that year it broke the top 50 as well (Spencer's only chart hit). <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/621706/osmonds162839.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/797513/osmonds162839.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>When MGM sent floundering boy band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmonds">The Osmonds</a> down to Fame in 1971, they took a song George had originally written with the Jackson 5 in mind, <a href="http://www.superseventies.com/1971_5singles.html">One Bad Apple</a>, all the way to number one on the pop charts.

The company also backed a label he had formed with his old partner Dan Greer, <b>Sounds Of Memphis</b>. Back recording former Goldwax artists like The Ovations and Spencer Wiggins, they were producing some great music, but times had changed, and the records weren't selling. MGM promo man Eddie Ray believed in George's talent (even after his employer had moved on), and in addition to placing one single with Chess in 1975, he put out what many consider to be George's finest record, <b>Talking About The Love I Have For You/I Don't Need You No More</b> on his own ER label in 1976.<br /><br />By the late seventies, George had left Fame and began working with cross-town rivals <a href="http://www.muscleshoalssound.org/">Muscle Shoals Sound</a>. There was one 'disco' single released on the studio's short lived record label, but the main work was going on behind the scenes. Unknown to the general public, Jackson was hunkered down with what may just have been the best band in the world recording demos of the songs he was writing. The resulting tapes became legendary, and remained unheard for over twenty years (more on that in a moment). His work from this period included blockbusters like Bob Seger's <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2609">Old Time Rock & Roll</a> in 1978, and James Brown's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1610012&s=143441&i=1610003">It's Too Funky In Here</a> in '79.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/153358/MALACO%202079.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/238333/MALACO%202079.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>As we've <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/06/zz-hill-please-dont-let-our-good-thing.html">mentioned before</a>, Tommy Couch and Wolf Stephenson up at Malaco heard George's demos and selected a couple of tunes for their new signee <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/06/zz-hill-please-dont-let-our-good-thing.html">Z.Z. Hill</a>'s second album, <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Down Home</a> in 1981. Jackson composition <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Down Home Blues</a>, which Malaco refused to release as a single, was just <i>huge</i> and helped make the record the largest selling 'blues' album in history. When they released George's <a href="http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Blues-R-B/Z-Z-Hill/Item/219/Down-Home.php">Cheatin' In The Next Room</a> as a single from the album in early 1982, it took off, spending five months on the R&B charts. On the basis of such unprecedented sales, Malaco hired Jackson as their new staff songwriter later that year. He still holds that position today, and has written countless fantastic songs for the label's soul stalwarts like <a href="http://bluescritic.com/DeniseLaSalle.html">Denise LaSalle</a>, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2005/12/little-milton-lovin-stick-stax-0148.html">Little Milton</a>, <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/02/bobby-bland-ive-just-got-to-forget.html">Bobby Bland</a> and <a href="http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/10/johnnie-taylor-soul-philosopher-love.html">Johnnie Taylor</a> (the Jackson penned <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=98030962&s=143441&i=98029570">Last Two Dollars</a> was a gigantic hit in 1996, and helped make Taylor's album <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=98030962&s=143441">Good Love</a> Malaco's biggest seller <i>ever</i>).<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/1600/709227/100978954_4a84d5b0b5.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/3954/945/200/366685/100978954_4a84d5b0b5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>George himself hadn't recorded much in the eighties, except for a few singles on local southern labels like Crosstown and Washataw. He recorded a duet with old favorite Louis Williams for Happy Hooker in 1985, and did some work with good ol' <a href="http://www.hepmerecords.com/">Senator Jones</a>, who had moved his <a href="http://www.hepmerecords.com/">Hep' Me</a> operation to friendlier quarters in Jackson, Mississippi in the early nineties.

George's demo tapes were included in the sale along with hundreds of other items. When <a href="http://www.grapevine-soul.com/index.htm">Grapevine Music</a> became the UK licensee for Malaco around the turn of the century, they began an ambitious search of their 'vaults'. Finding Jackson's Muscle Shoals demos intact and sounding just as good as the day they were recorded must have been like finding the Holy Grail. They have released <a href="http://www.grapevine-soul.com/albums.htm">two excellent CDs</a> of the material so far, and you should buy them.
