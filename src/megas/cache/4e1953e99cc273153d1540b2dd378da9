We will enter into familiar folk-tales, fairy tales, and classic literature, and explore their themes through drama-based activities, such as frozen ?sculptures?, ?hot-seat? interviews, speaking the inner thoughts of a character, or devising short scenes in small groups, all within the context of the Story of the Day. The nature of our drama activities encourages the 5 Cs: Co-operation/Collaboration, Communication, Concentration, Commitment, and Caring. To those, Nancy would add, especially for autistic participants: Creativity, Compromise, and Conversation.
