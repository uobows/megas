But make no mistake, under Kelly our FB program again strives
for excellence, which is not to understate the damage Monk Malloy
and his minions perpetrated, and it&#039;s lingering effects.  

Our 2012 team had almost no chance against Alabama absent Divine 
Intervention. But they did return us &#039;to the conversation&#039;. 
Their uNDefeated regular season left us with uNfinisheD business. 

In 2015, coaching - specifically VanGorder - derailed us and the 
HC ignored the scheme&#039;s problems. 
If DeShone had stayed, would we have lost a single game last year ?
Or would a 2017 Natty have been possible ?
