So filled with Poetry, Art and Compassion I was reminded how 66 years ago I spent the summer doing 250 drawings of dirt. My entry into being an artist was not a decision, it is what I am, and to this day I am still drawing dirt. I tried to ask a question about the difference between making a decision to dance or simply being a dancer- no decision. The difference is enormous and I hope your Dance School teaches the difference whether you chose to dance or you were born a dancer. The difference will effect how you design your life, I can say out of 66 years in art about 16 were very bad years, 50 were good. If this had been a decision, in a bad year I might give up. If you dance because you are nothing else, you will never give up- you are Ballet, I am art, I do not make art.  This distinction is very important- you should have me give a talk about my life in art. Your students will come away knowing a bit more about themselves and realize how important they are in a very competitive world in art- they are artists and just as I paint, they dance.  Just as my art is often called Transportational, Dancers too change the lives of those they dance for.. Students must be taught how to never give up, to give up there might be no where else to go or to be.
Those with callings cannot give up because very simply there is nothing else who they are, when you are art you can only succeed. If you decided to dance you may have other skills, to give up is to understand one decision may not have worked but you have other skills to set goals on. You dance  as a dancer, but you are not Ballet.
You are multi skilled as one who is The Ballet has 1 skill- to become Dance, not to do dance. Give up some time to focus on what you are 
not who you are. I, Paul Czubay,  do not make art, I am art and being art I cannot ever not succeed. Become comfortable with what you are, and realize how you were chosen to become Dance and how much magic and beauty you will bring to others for your entire life. Those who want to be a Dancer may be great Dancers, highly skilled, but they will lack the magic, they will dance with compassion but not bring other worlds to us because they will lack that special element understood only between themselves and the art whom they are not. Artists are not taught to be artists, they are art, that cannot be taught. Students are such successes, today I realized that just to get up in front of a crowd and dance with all the beauty and poetry you were not taught, you simply are, very few are but all succeed. Today you changed my life forever,  all of you, and I am a very difficult audience- I am too old not to miss tricks, no tricks at noon today, very important and magical students who are becoming Dance, you all are Ballet, you are dance as I am art.
