I hope you all had a lovely Christmas.  I wish I could say the same for myself. I was so thrilled at being suddenly told that I could return home for Christmas - mainly because I could access the internet - that I hadn't thought through the implications. Firstly, the turkey crown and trimmings I'd previously bought were frozen - requiring over 48 hours of defrosting - so they were out of the the question. All of the fresh vegetables and fruit I had in the fridge had begun to rot after amost a week. So they all had to be be thrown away. And most of the cupboards were bare. <br /><br />My health is such that there's absolutely no way I can make it to the shops, albiet that thay're only two minutes walk away. And even if I'd made it, I just don't have the energy to carry even not particularly heavy weights. So for the past few days, I've basicallly starved. I had a few boxes of chocolates, but they just gave me indigestion. I've spent most of the time in bed, dreamimg of comfort foods like tomato and chicken soup and fish pie with mashed potato and quiche and ... All of which are available a few hundred yards away - but I haven't beeen able to get them. I feel so weak and also I've started coughing, which up until now hasn't happened at all. <br /><br />The hospital transport should be here soon - I know I'll be in for a couple of days at least, but unless they or social services can arrange for someone to get me some provisisions, I won't be rushing to return home. I'm about to undergo radio and chemotherapy and should be building myself up, not starving myself to a point of near collapse.  And then there was my other plan. I've been with BT Broadband for over 15 years - most recently with their most expensive top of the range high speed product. I recalled that they now also own a mobile provider. So on Monday I called, explaining my position and seeing if I could buy a smart phone with internet data acccess. No problem they said. Next day delivery they said. I was absolutely delighted. My internet connnection problems were solved. <br /><br />However, on Tuesday I received a text message. Delivery should be Wednesday. Then another text message - delivery should be Thursday. I callled them and was told that actually delivery will now most likely be next week. No problem I thought - they could deliver to the hospital. On no they said. Delivery has to be made to the address  the order was made from - for 'security reasons'. I've been unable to acertain exactly what these 'security reasons' are, but they're adamant that they can only deliver to my home address even though they know my situation and that fact that I'll be just a few miles away in hospital. I've appealed with them, I've pleaded with them, but to no avail. It's so frustrating that thay should be so inflexible. And I'm so very dispppointed.  So, I bid you all a very happy New Year.

I had the transfusions overnight on Monday and on Tuesday. Then, on Wednesday, a very serious doctor and his entourage appeared by my bedside, advising me that x-rays taken on Monday had revealed 'shadows' and that I would be in hospital for at least 10 days.<br /><br />On Thursday morning another doctor with a much bigger entourage but a more encouraging bedside manner advised me I was immediately going for a CT scan. Later that afternoon they all reappeared and the doctor dropped the bombshelll that I had lung cancer that has spread to some bones and possibly other organs. I was advised it was inoperable, that I would be receiving both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but until I had a lung biopsy it was impossible to say the full extent of what exactly what is what.  I was told the biopsy would be at lunchtimeish on Friday. So after a couple of pieces of toast and a cup of coffee at about 5:30am, I was officially 'nil by mouth'. A series of doctors then apppeared saying I had various blood problems, including a clotting problem and that I'd have to have a load of drips of various drugs - including an experimental one that caused me to shake uncontrollably for several hours. Anyway, they eventually took yet another blood sample for testing that would hopefully allow for the biopsy to go ahead. However, they apparently didn't take enough bloood, so several hours later yet another blood test was taken and sent to the lab. <br /><br />And at 5:45pm I was told that all the technicians had gone home and no biopsy would be taking place until at least Monday.  Then just before lunchtime on Saturday (today) a doctor appeared saying that the earliest a biopsy would take place would be Thursday and that I could return home until then. It won't be until a couple or so days after that the full horrors are revealed and the 'nasty' stuff reallly begins.  The nurses have been absolutely fantastic, even though they constantly woke me in the middle of the night to stick needles in me, test my blood pressure and repeatedly advise me that I was overheating and needed to take more paracetamol.  I'm still in pain and seriously out of breath, but I'm really thankful at being able to return home for a while.

Fistly, many, many thanks for all of your kind comments following my last post. They are extremely appreciated.

I managed to purchase a few things then had to sit on the pavement outside the store before eventually making it back home.  I know I should have visted the doctor, but it's quite a walk away - and I'd never have made it. Also, the last time I visted the shops, due to the circumstances, I didn't get any cash from the ATM - so I've had no money to get a taxi.

However, as of this morning my fridge was completely empty, so, for the first time in weeks I had to venture out to the shops again. I thought if 'paced' myself I'd be okay. Sadly this didn't turn out to be the case and I had what I can only really describe as having a 'funny turn'. The very kind ladies in the local Co-op quickly got me a chair and then ordered me a taxi in order to make the short journey home.  And so here I am. I suspect I should be in hospital - I really am in a lot of pain - and just walking upstairs can be a massive struggle. However, I'm a stubborn bloody idiot and having spent the best part of a year in hospital when I was a child, I think it's fair to say I'm not a big fan of the places. <br /><br />Particularly at this time of year.  So, unless something dramatic happens, my plan is to pace myself over the next three weeks or so - I think I have enough food in the freezer and cupboards - and then contact the medical people. Due to various anxiety 'issues' I've suffered over the last decade or so, I've lost touch with just about everyone I used to consider to be a 'friend'. So I'm pretty much on my own with this one.  Apologies for this being a misery-fest, I but thought it was best to keep you up to date. Also, while I'm thankful to Ratz for organising the gofundme page, I'd be extremely grateful if the money kindly donated was returned to the original donors.  I'll do my best to keep you up to date with whatever transpires.

The very kind ladies in the local Co-op quickly got me a chair and then ordered me a taxi in order to make the short journey home.  And so here I am. I suspect I should be in hospital - I really am in a lot of pain - and just walking upstairs can be a massive struggle. However, I'm a stubborn bloody idiot and having spent the best part of a year in hospital when I was a child, I think it's fair to say I'm not a big fan of the places. <br /><br />Particularly at this time of year.  So, unless something dramatic happens, my plan is to pace myself over the next three weeks or so - I think I have enough food in the freezer and cupboards - and then contact the medical people. Due to various anxiety 'issues' I've suffered over the last decade or so, I've lost touch with just about everyone I used to consider to be a 'friend'. So I'm pretty much on my own with this one.  Apologies for this being a misery-fest, I but thought it was best to keep you up to date. Also, while I'm thankful to Ratz for organising the gofundme page, I'd be extremely grateful if the money kindly donated was returned to the original donors.  I'll do my best to keep you up to date with whatever transpires. In the meantime, I hope you have a lovely Christmas and a Happy New Year. <br /><br />Kev           ";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1481900400;}i:6;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10345672.post-1191364197351182044";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 09:00:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:44:"I need to take a short break from doing this";s:11:"description";s:966:"While I decide whether to continue posting here or not.
