I am not a Punk Rocker";s:12:"atom_content";s:32910:"<span style="font-size: large;">I like punk rock. &nbsp;But I'm not a punk rocker. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Growing up being a guitar player and being into music, there were really only two types of people you could hang out with: heavy metal dudes and punk rockers. &nbsp;They were the only two groups where the guitar players mattered (back in those days, it was synthesizers and keytars if you wanted to be "popular."). </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Popular music, 1986:</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4jFlSaDnow?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">The metal guys were better musicians, and actually studied theory and harmony and stuff. &nbsp; They were usually very serious when it came to music, and didn't have a sense of humor. &nbsp;I remember the local metal guys being really mad when <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFl7Cq2fvqI">'This Is Spinal Tap'</a> came out, because in their words "It MADE FUN of Rock and Roll!" </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Punk rockers, on the other hand, were guys who really couldn't play but wanted to be in bands anyway, to get some modicum of "glory" and of course to get girls. &nbsp;They didn't take anything seriously, for the most part, but there was a lot of posturing and pseudo-political ranting. &nbsp;I didn't fit in with either group, but wound up hanging out with both just by virtue of the fact that I played guitar. &nbsp;I was literally the only guy in Columbia, Missouri who was into rockabilly guitar, so I had to find my friends where I could.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I wanted to be cool, but I just didn't have it in me. &nbsp;Myself and my buddy Mace (who wound up being the bass player in my first band, The Untamed Youth, and who is now my step-brother) used to go see punk rock shows all the time. &nbsp;We were nerds, total losers, and the punk rock shows were where the disaffected youth showed up to bond with other outcasts. &nbsp;The only problem was that Mace and I were such losers that even the outcasts didn't want us.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">We saw such bands as The Circle Jerks, D.O.A., The Descendents, Fear, Flipper, Husker Du, JFA (Jodie Foster's Army), MDC (Millions of Dead Cops), Toxic Reasons, TSOL, and a bunch of local bands like Three Legged Dog, Bloody Mess and the Scabs, Lurking Fear, First Bank of Christ, etc. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">The bands that I really liked, though, were the most uncool--The Ramones and The Dickies.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Mace and I went to see The Ramones and the Dickies on a double bill at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis in 1986. &nbsp;At the time, both bands were considered total has-beens. &nbsp;The Ramones could still fill the place, but everybody talked about how they were "over" and how their last few albums had sucked. &nbsp;The Dickies were a band from L.A. that had several albums out in the late 1970s, but by 1986 they were not considered a viable band anymore. &nbsp;It didn't matter to me. &nbsp;I loved both the Dickies and the Ramones from the minute that I saw them. &nbsp;Both bands were loud, fast, and STOOPID! &nbsp;No political posturing, just basic rock and roll with lyrics that bordered on the moronic.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Mace and I were so inspired by seeing the Ramones that we made our own movie in high school, that we submitted as our humanities project. &nbsp;Our teacher, Linda Harlan, gave us an "A" not because it was good, but because we had been so ballsy in taking over the entire school to make our silly movie.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Below: Behold the horror of my 1986 senior year Humanities project, "ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL." &nbsp;</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po5123CGov8?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Yes, that's our actual high school principal, Dr. Wayne Walker. &nbsp;I still marvel at how we got him to say our stupid lines and have Mace give him the Nazi arm salute. &nbsp;The "Rock and Roll God" was played by our good friend and bad influence Joe Bargmann, who was several years our senior and a wise-cracking smart ass journalism student at the University. &nbsp;Joe got us into more fun and more trouble than we ever would have on our own. &nbsp;Joe loved the Ramones as much as we did. &nbsp;Joe was the Untamed Youth's "secret weapon" for several years until he moved away. &nbsp;The drummer was our good friend "Rabid" Rick Carter, who played in my earliest rockabilly band, The Rockin' Tailfins. &nbsp;"Rabid" Rick had an Elvis museum in his mobile home that included a Red Hot candy (in a picture frame) that he had plucked from in between the seat cushions on one of Elvis' Cadillacs at a museum in Memphis. &nbsp;He swore it had been Elvis' Red Hot.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Note: In the movie, I'm playing my 1967 Gibson ES-335 guitar. &nbsp;You literally could not get LESS punk rock than a Gibson ES-335. &nbsp;I played the same guitar in high school jazz band and our teacher used to ridicule me by calling me "Conway" (as in Conway Twitty) to make fun of my choice of guitar. &nbsp;My punk rock "fashion" statement consisted of a pair of old jeans I had ripped up doing chores in my parents back yard. &nbsp;Mace, of course, wins first place fashion prize with his bi-level haircut and earring--ha ha ha! &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">The funny thing I remember about all the punk rock shows back in the 1980s was how caveman primal everybody acted. &nbsp;This was before you could google "How to be punk rock" or "Who is cool right now" on your Iphone, so the only way to learn was to hang out and observe, and when the time was right, ask questions. &nbsp;All these outcast high school and college kids would get together in some garage or basement or small club, and just hang out, waiting for someone to do something, or something cool to happen. &nbsp;It was very much like 'Lord of the Flies,' in that there was always some guy who wanted to be the leader, and some guy who wanted to fight him to be the leader. &nbsp;All the girls were so immature it was usually thug-like fighting behavior among the males that impressed them. &nbsp;Even though the punk rock scene was supposed to be about progressive views when it came to racism, it was still pure troglodyte when it came to male-female relations. &nbsp;You were always afraid to talk too much because somebody a few years older than you would always cut you down and make you feel stupid. &nbsp;There were a lot of kids who were into punk music because it was "alternative" and not in the mainstream, but they were really hippies with nowhere else to go. &nbsp;This made for an interesting mix of really aggressive kids who either did speedy drugs or needed Ritalin along with a bunch of stoned hippie punk kids who could barely move. &nbsp;In the corner of the room, leaning against the wall, there stood Mace and myself, completely ostracized from the rest of the ostracized kids.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">It may sound like I didn't like the punk rock scene, and I guess that's probably true. &nbsp;I didn't care too much for the "scene," but I dug the music. &nbsp;The music was fast, loud, and dangerous, three things that were desperately needed after all the peaceful, mellow, BORING music of the 1970s. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">How I remember the 1970s:</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRmvNMUEFZg?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">For that reason, punk rock was very important. &nbsp;It was a musical version of sweeping out the cobwebs and starting over again with a clean house. &nbsp;I have since learned to appreciate a lot of music from the 1970s, and I don't really mind hippies that much, they're generally cool people. &nbsp;But at that time, man, we NEEDED punk rock music to get rid of all that peaceful easy mellow patchouli bearded naked incense hippie stuff that had been piling up for the last ten years. &nbsp;So in that sense, yes, I really liked punk rock and what it stood for. &nbsp;But I just wasn't a punk rocker, no matter how hard I tried.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">The defining moment of my non-punk-rockness occurred the night that Black Flag came to town.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Black Flag was one of the most legendary and most influential "hardcore" punk rock bands from California. &nbsp;The band formed in 1979 and went through several lead singers before finally finding Henry Rollins as lead vocalist in 1981, and he remained the band's lead singer until they broke up in 1986. &nbsp;Black Flag were one of the most popular, if not the most popular, hardcore punk band of the 1980s. &nbsp;When they came to town, it was a very, very big deal. &nbsp;They were scheduled to play the Blue Note and there were fears of rioting and the show getting shut down. &nbsp;It was scary and dangerous and exciting.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Lead singer Henry Rollins was a muscular, sinewy young dude with an angry look on his face all the time. &nbsp;Even when he smiled he looked pissed off. &nbsp;Some people hated Henry Rollins, some people loved him. &nbsp;Because he was so beautifully sculpted and yet so angry, girls went crazy for the guy, which probably made the dudes hate him even more. &nbsp;He started out with a skinhead look, but by 1986 the whole band was wearing long hair. &nbsp;I thought the long hair look was weak. &nbsp;It was as if the hippies had won! &nbsp;What did I know. &nbsp;Even at 17 years old I was balding, I wasn't going to be able to join the hair-rock club even if I wanted to.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I always wanted to hate Henry Rollins, but I quite enjoy his writing, especially the must-read book "Get In The Van--On The Road With Black Flag." &nbsp;In fact, one quote from the book has always stuck with me, for I had a similar epiphany in my own life. &nbsp;Describing the way he felt before he joined the band, when Black Flag came through Rollins' home town of Washington, D.C:</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><i><span style="font-size: large;">"They (Black Flag) stayed at Ian's house after the show and left the next morning. &nbsp;I remember watching their van pull away up the street and wanting to be in it. &nbsp;It was amazing to me how they pulled in, played, hung out with the locals and then took off on the next adventure. &nbsp;I had to hurry up and get to work.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></i><i><span style="font-size: large;">"As I walked down the hill toward a long night at the workplace, I started getting depressed. &nbsp;Black Flag was a bunch of guys who were out there winging it and trying to do something with their lives. &nbsp;They had no fixed income and they lived like dogs, but they were living life with a lot more guts than I was by a long shot. &nbsp;I had a steady income and an apartment and money in the bank. &nbsp;But I also had a job where I got yelled at when things didn't go right. &nbsp;I had to be there all the time. &nbsp;I saw the same streets and the same people every day. &nbsp;My job took over a lot of my waking hours.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></i><i><span style="font-size: large;">"After I had hung out with the Flag guys, I saw that there was a lot more out there to be seen and done and I didn't think I was ever going to do any of it. &nbsp;That night at work, everything in my life felt meaningless. &nbsp;I knew that somehow I was blowing it. &nbsp;I had a low level panic attack. &nbsp;I got a glimpse of something that made it impossible to bullshit myself. &nbsp;I wished it didn't open my eyes so much and make me see so clearly.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></i><i><span style="font-size: large;">"I saw my life stretching out in front of me. &nbsp;Same town, same people, same everything. &nbsp;It felt as if I was getting tied down and beaten by life. &nbsp;They had guts. &nbsp;The way they were living went against all the things I had been taught to believe were right. &nbsp;If I had listened to my father, I would have joined the Navy, served and gone into the straight world without a whimper. &nbsp;I'm not putting that down. &nbsp;But it's not the life for everyone."</span></i><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">--Henry Rollins, "Get In The Van--On The Road With Black Flag"</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I had many similar experiences going to see bands play at the Blue Note club. &nbsp;I was 17 and working a crappy day job (Henry Rollins worked at Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream, I worked at Mizzou Bar-B-Q--same difference), and I would go to see bands who drove up in their vans, rocked the locals, bedded down a few of our local girls, and partied like it was 1999. &nbsp;The next day their van would pull away and they would be off to have more fun and make more music. &nbsp;I was in high school and working my job, and all I could think about was pulling away in that van with a band of my own.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Mace and I went to see Black Flag play at the Blue Note. &nbsp;Thanks to magic of the internet and obsessed fans, I can tell you exactly what date that was: Tuesday, May 6, 1986. &nbsp;Thanks to the <a href="http://www.dementlieu.com/users/obik/arc/blackflag/1986.html">Dementlieu Punk Archive</a> for that!</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Richard King and Phil Costello, the owners of the Blue Note, were some adventurous and open-minded dudes. &nbsp;Thinking back now, there's no way I would host punk rock shows at a venue I owned. &nbsp;They were real supporters of the arts, and had everything there from jazz and blues and alternative rock to punk rock and rap. &nbsp;King and Costello had one thing on their side: the original Blue Note on the Business Loop was a real shithole. &nbsp;There wasn't much that could be done to destroy the place. &nbsp;They prepared for the punk rock onslaught by completely emptying the room of chairs and tables and anything else that could be thrown. &nbsp;This made it seem dangerous just upon walking in the door--holy crap! &nbsp;They took out all the chairs and tables! &nbsp;What do you think might HAPPEN tonight? &nbsp;This was exciting!</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Mace and I stood against the back wall of the club, our normal place to hang out and observe. &nbsp;The opening band was playing (I forget their name) and the dance floor was deserted. &nbsp;Everybody was waiting for the main attraction--Black Flag!</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Henry Rollins walked in during the opening band's set, preening, posing, looking around the room with a big scowl on his face. &nbsp;He stood in the middle of the room, on the empty dance floor, looking disaffected, blank. &nbsp;He removed all his clothes, got butt naked, and then put on his signature gym shorts and tennis shoes, getting ready for the Black Flag show. &nbsp;Mace and I looked at each other and thought one thing about this very public display--"Man, I wish my dick was that big so I could do that!" &nbsp;Looking back at it now, that was a pretty genius way to display your wares to the local ladies. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Black Flag started playing, and this is EXACTLY how I remember that show. &nbsp;This is how everything looked and felt and smelled and tasted. &nbsp;It makes perfect sense, because this video was shot a few weeks before I saw them at the Blue Note:</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKX3k92tKaA?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">During this time period, I was really trying to feel out what I should do with my life. &nbsp;I was really into rockabilly, surf, 1960s garage, and other music genres from bygone eras. &nbsp;I felt like the odd man out in the world. &nbsp;There was nobody in Columbia, Missouri that shared my enthusiasm for Jerry Lee Lewis alternate takes and the nuances of the original Chuck Berry and Link Wray guitar styles. &nbsp;I was trying to decide if I should quit being the weirdo "Retro" kid and get into something that was now and new and happening and current. &nbsp;I seriously considered becoming a punk rocker.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I was 17, just about to graduate High School and turn 18 and enter into the next phase of my life. &nbsp;I thought to myself, maybe I should get a punk band together, something that straddles the Ramones and Black Flag and all this stuff with some poppy hooks and catchy melodies....maybe that would be successful? &nbsp;Maybe I should hop on a bandwagon for once, it occurred to me.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouSElV34hYY/UYA6mcgFHZI/AAAAAAAAAXE/srwwCZ35_ag/s1600/1298490434-kidwentpunk.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: large;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouSElV34hYY/UYA6mcgFHZI/AAAAAAAAAXE/srwwCZ35_ag/s640/1298490434-kidwentpunk.jpeg" width="640" /></span></a></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">The Black Flag show was intense, hot, and loud. &nbsp;I really got caught up in the excitement. &nbsp;Henry Rollins was like a panther on stage, you never knew if he was going to sing or beat the crap out of someone. &nbsp;The mosh pit was insane, about 80 aggressive dudes slam dancing in a giant circle to the music of Black Flag.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">For the completely uninitiated (Mom?) who are reading this who don't know what I'm talking about, punk rock dancing started out with innocent little stupid dances like the "pogo" (jumping up and down) into a brutal form of dancing known as "slam dancing." &nbsp;Slam dancing wasn't really dancing, it was just running around in a pit getting out all your agressions on other guys that couldn't get laid. &nbsp;It wasn't really fighting, and there was a code of ethics (you were supposed to help up anybody that fell down), but it sure looked like a bunch of dudes fighting to the untrained eye.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Slam dancing was done in something called "The Mosh Pit" ("Moshing" was another term for slam dancing). &nbsp;The Mosh Pit was where you did NOT want to be at a punk rock show, because if you were just trying to watch the band, you'd get hit by some dude's elbow or fist as they ran around like wild hyenas in the pit. &nbsp;I saw many fragile little females get knocked off their feet by aggro punk rock slam dancers, an uncomfortable memory to this day.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">There was an entire episode of "Quincy, M.E." devoted to how old, normal people couldn't understand why these punk rockers would do this to themselves:</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpYd7bOn52M?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Really, though, slam dancing was just a way for young suburban males to take out their aggression in a somewhat approved manner. &nbsp;Since fighting, stealing, murdering, and other ways were frowned upon by parents and authorities, at least a punk rock show offered the opportunity to get in the Mosh Pit and have sweaty, aggressive, latently homo-erotic contact with a bunch of like-minded high energy dudes.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I watched Black Flag and I thought to myself--screw it, I'm getting in the pit. &nbsp;I had always been too chicken to join in. &nbsp;I thought, I'm going whole hog or none! &nbsp;My way has always been to jump into the deep end and see if you drown. &nbsp;Maybe this punk rock thing was for me. &nbsp;I needed to know.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I got in the Mosh Pit and tried to emulate what the other guys were doing. &nbsp;I went around and around in the pit for about 3 minutes and then--WHAM!--some guy hit me upside the head. &nbsp;I was stunned for a second and then I realized that when I got hit in the back of the head, one of my contact lenses had fallen out. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">There I was, Henry Rollins screaming like a maniac, the band raging at top volume behind him, and 80 sweaty punk rock guys swarming in a circle around me, most of them wearing combat boots. &nbsp;I was looking down with my one good eye for the better part of 15 seconds looking for my lost contact lens.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">15 seconds in a Mosh Pit is approximately 30 years in normal human time. &nbsp;I frantically looked for my contact lens, thinking about how pissed off my parents were going to be when I told them. &nbsp;It occurred to me, how am I gonna drive home, I don't have my glasses! &nbsp;Finally, I realized what a foolish move it was to try and find a tiny contact lens on the floor of a Black Flag mosh pit in a dark club. &nbsp;I broke free of the pit and went back over to where Mace was standing. &nbsp;He laughed at me.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qyLQyUCBrGU/UYA6B54GkmI/AAAAAAAAAW8/iJLDdld61cE/s1600/tumblr_m916nzrH5s1r2jmt5o1_500.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span

/></span></a></div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I can't remember if I stayed around for the end of the show, but I do remember driving home. &nbsp;I had to hold one hand over my eye where the contact lens had fallen out so that I could see to drive. &nbsp;The whole time, I was thinking to myself, well, I guess I'm not a punk rocker! &nbsp;I tried. &nbsp;I really did.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Every now and then some young kid will talk about punk bands and I'll throw in, "Yeah, I saw Black Flag in 1986." &nbsp;They are always impressed that I witnessed them with my own eyes. &nbsp;I leave out the part about losing a contact lens in the Mosh Pit.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">I decided then and there that I was not a punk rocker. &nbsp;I had to abandon any thoughts of going in the punk direction, and turn my energies back to what I liked--old stuff. &nbsp;Maybe I could't ever sell a million records, but dammit, I was going to be the best "Retro" rocker that I could be. &nbsp;I was going to learn everything about it and play as well as I possibly could and meet as many of my heroes as humanly possible. &nbsp;It was somewhat akin to realizing that I was never going to be a rich farmer with a fertile field and giant mechanized modern farm equipment. &nbsp;Instead, by choosing roots-rock music as my career, it was like taking an old broken down mule and wandering into an unplowed rocky desert field where a garden couldn't be grown. &nbsp;I didn't care, I just got to work with my old mule and I plowed the shit out of that impossibly rocky field. &nbsp;Here I am, 27 years later, and I've pretty much accomplished everything I set out to do. &nbsp;I saw a lot of farmers with fancy equipment go out of business during that time, and I'm still here.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Besides, it was 1986, punk rock was considered over and done with commercially. &nbsp;The tour that I saw Black Flag play was their last tour, and they broke up a few months later. &nbsp;Punk rock was probably a terrible career option, and I made the right decision. &nbsp;I mean, there's no way that my concept of Ramones mixed with Black Flag with poppy hooks and catchy melodies would ever work. &nbsp;That was a stupid idea.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

than you ever wanted to know about the Gene Vincent song "B-I-Bickey-Bi-Bo-Bo-Go"";s:12:"atom_content";s:30531:"When I was in tenth grade, I was really feeling my oats about who I was and what my place was in this world. &nbsp;Mostly, that entailed being a jerk to any authority figures in my life, including my parents, teachers, school authorities, etc. &nbsp;This is natural behavior for the male species in that awkward time of their life when they have tons of testosterone flowing through their bodies, but no money, no car, and no girl. &nbsp;Such was the predicament I was in back in 1984, when I was a sophomore at Rock Bridge High School in Columbia, Missouri. &nbsp;I had squat, except for a lot of testosterone and a love of 1950s American Rock and Roll music.<br /><br />How I perceived myself:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjk6P5MaayY?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></div><br />How I actually was:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bVpnUHGpFDk?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></div><br /><br />My English teacher at the time was a very nice guy, but a real square cat. &nbsp;He seemed ancient to me but in retrospect he was probably thirty or thirty-five at the most. &nbsp;Balding, button-down shirt, sans-a-belt slacks, comfortable shoes--he represented everything in life that I despised. &nbsp;I lived in a world where turned up collars, sharkskin jackets, gabardine slacks, two-tone shoes, and bright colors designed to offend the sensibilities were the ideal. &nbsp;I always was a weird kid. &nbsp;I just thought that 1956 looked a lot cooler, and I guess I still do.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3-OaNevkfg?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></div><br />One day the aforementioned English teacher asked us all to write a paper about a song that meant something to us. &nbsp;He said it could be any song, as long as it meant something. &nbsp;In my rebellious world, I thought that the rock music that had been popular since the late 1960s hippie movement was the worst thing that had ever happened in the history of the world. &nbsp;In my mind, before Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play, everything had been cool, fun, unpretentious, and exciting. &nbsp;After the Beatles, the Doors, Bob Dylan, and all the Fleetwood Mac-era pretenders followed suit, all I could see was a bunch of pretentious, self-important rock star "artistes" who were really serious about their "lyrics," and who were always talking about peace and love and a bunch of other subjects that had nothing to do with me getting laid. &nbsp;I had no use for this so-called "important" rock music.<br /><br />In a grand act of rebellion, I wrote my English paper about a Gene Vincent song, cut in 1956 and released in April, 1957, entitled "B-I-Bickey-Bi-Bo-Bo-Go." &nbsp;It was a nonsense song. &nbsp;The lyrics meant nothing. &nbsp;My English paper reflected the fact that I thought it was important to have some music that was about fun and nothing else. &nbsp;I pleaded that not all music had to be "important" and needed dissection of the lyrics like some mopey art school student. &nbsp;I wish I had kept the paper, because as I remember, it was quite well-written. &nbsp;I made my case as well as a 15-year old free thinker iconoclast could.<br /><br />Below: my original 45rpm copy of "B-I-Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go."&nbsp; I found it at a radio station in Jefferson City, Missouri.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a

Blue Caps.&nbsp; This song rocks!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/G63R94Jy6cM?feature=player_embedded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></div><br />The teacher took my finished paper and gave it a quick read. &nbsp;He could have given me an F, but to his credit, he just rolled his eyes back in his head and said, "I'm sorry, this assignment has to be about a song that MEANS SOMETHING!" &nbsp;He handed the paper back and gave me instructions to start over.<br /><br />I went home and wound up writing my paper about the Blasters song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q-izDANZ5M">"Border Radio," </a>written by Dave Alvin. &nbsp;I guess that song had enough meaningful lyrical content in it to barely squeak by, and I remember getting a B+. &nbsp;As fate would have it, eventually I wound up knowing and becoming friends with Dave and Phil Alvin, and the rest of the Blasters.<br /><br />Years went by, and music became my career. &nbsp;Although my music tastes expanded and I learned to love many different and varied types of music, rockabilly music and 1950s rock and roll stayed close to my heart. &nbsp;I've been lucky enough to meet and play music with most of my musical heroes. &nbsp;The legacy of Gene Vincent's music remained important to me. &nbsp;Although Gene Vincent died in 1971, I have been able to play with Dickie Harrell, Johnny Meeks and Russell Willaford of Gene Vincent's Blue Caps band, and I have spent time with other Blue Caps, including Tommy "Bubba" Facenda, Paul Peek, Jerry Merritt, and Bobby Jones.<br /><br />Below: Gene Vincent (laying on the stage), Paul Peek

Los Angeles in 1991, I wound up meeting many of the key players in the Gene Vincent legacy. &nbsp;I interviewed 96-year old Ken Nelson, the A&amp;R man who signed Gene Vincent to Capitol Records in 1956. &nbsp;I bought records from Cliffie Stone, another important man in the history of Capitol Records, who also published a great number of songs through his Central Songs Publishing Company (which, as it turns out, was secretly owned by Capitol Records' Ken Nelson). &nbsp;I knew Ronny Weiser of Rollin' Rock Records, who had recorded Gene Vincent singing acapella right before he died. &nbsp;I worked with Billy Zoom of the punk band X, who had backed up Gene Vincent at several gigs in his final, declining years. &nbsp;Gene Vincent was also buried just outside of Los Angeles, at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall, and visiting Gene's grave was a necessary stop of any visiting Rock and Roll fan.<br /><br />Below: The author and Capitol A&amp;R man/producer Ken Nelson.<br

moving to Los Angeles, one of the fringe guys on the Hollywood music scene was a jazz drummer named Roy Harte, who owned a drum store on Santa Monica Boulevard called Roy Harte's Drum City.<br /><br />Below: Roy Harte's Drum City, in the 1990s. &nbsp;This is how I always remember it looking.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a

Boulevard populated by transvestite gay hustlers, who walked the Boulevard night and day in a zombie-like trance, waiting for their next fifty dollar trick. &nbsp;Drum City was a store that had obviously seen better days. &nbsp;It had a large gravel parking lot (see photo above), and the whole place had the general odor of decay. &nbsp;Roy Harte held court inside his store, where he had watched Hollywood go from glamorous heyday to a dirty, dangerous place where only homeless runaways and German tourists dared to walk the streets.<br /><br />I loved Roy Harte. &nbsp;He was a genuine jazz drumming <a href="http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.com/2011/10/roy-harte-and-drum-city-drummers-are.html">legend</a>, and I liked him because he had played on several Tennessee Ernie Ford and Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant sessions (his quote stuck with me: "Those hillbilly cats could play ANYTHING, man!") &nbsp;I went into Roy Harte's Drum City half a dozen times, always in search of some rare vintage drum part that I couldn't find any place else. &nbsp;Somewhere, Roy always had what I needed, in a bucket or a coffee can or a tray full of miscellaneous junk. &nbsp;When I tried to pay him, Roy always said "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! &nbsp;BRING ME A BEER NEXT TIME!" &nbsp;I brought him a few Bud 'Tall Boys,' but wondered how the hell he paid the rent all those years if all he took in were cans of beer.<br /><br />Below: Roy Harte, in his prime.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a

class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />Roy Harte played a tiny, tiny part in Gene Vincent history. &nbsp;When Capitol Records held a contest to find a new drumming sensation to record a drum-themed album, Dickie Harrell of Gene Vincent's Blue Caps won the contest, and the recording contract along with it (despite the fact that he had already been a Capitol Recording Artist with Vincent). &nbsp;Roy Harte played alongside Harrell on the album, and the album's colorful cover was taken inside Roy Harte's Drum City.<br /><br /><div class="separator"

I was once again in search of an impossibly rare part for one of my vintage drum kits. &nbsp;When I got out of my car in the gravel parking lot, my eyes focused on what was beneath my feet. &nbsp;At first, I didn't know what it was I was seeing, I just knew it was different than the gravel I was used to. &nbsp;Then it dawned on me what I was seeing, and it gave me a sickening sensation in the pit of my stomach. &nbsp;On top of the gravel throughout the entire parking lot were broken bits of 78rpm phonograph records. &nbsp;Thousands, no--make that tens of thousands--of records had been smashed up and used to create a new layer of asphalt.<br /><br />I rushed inside and asked Roy what the deal was with all the records smashed up in the parking lot. &nbsp;His reply was to tell me that he was going to be leaving the building and going out of business, and he had a room upstairs filled to the brim with "worthless" (his words) 78's. &nbsp;I asked if they were for sale, and he replied they were--25 cents a pop. &nbsp;I walked upstairs to a room that smelled of mold. &nbsp;It was dark, dingy and in complete chaos. &nbsp;There were records on shelves on the wall, in piles on the floor, and everywhere else you looked. &nbsp;I settled down and got to work.<br /><br />A good record hound knows that chances are, if there are a thousand records in a pile, there has to be one good one in there. &nbsp;I started looking through the rubble, hoping for that one prized needle-in-a-haystack disc. &nbsp;Most of it was not stuff I was interested in--78's of classical music, and lots of copies of jazz releases on Nocturne Records, a label that Roy Harte had co-founded in the 1950s. &nbsp;I kept digging.<br /><br />After about three hours of digging, eventually I found a small stack of acetates--one of a kind records cut directly on a lathe, usually for demo purposes. &nbsp;Acetates are fun finds for a record collector, because when you find an acetate it's usually the only copy of whatever it is in existence. <br /><br />One of the acetates was on a Central Songs demonstration label. &nbsp;Central Songs was Cliffie Stone's publishing company, secretly owned by Capitol Records' Ken Nelson, who published a lot of the songs recorded by Capitol artists. &nbsp;The label only said "B-I-Bickey-Bi-Bo-Bo-Boo" in crude cursive handwritten letters. &nbsp;I thought to myself, that's weird, because the Gene Vincent song of a similar title ended wth "Go," not "Boo." &nbsp;I bought the acetate for 25 cents and took it home, not knowing what it was I'd found.<br /><br />Playing the acetate at home, I was pleased to find that it was indeed a crude original demo for the Gene Vincent song. &nbsp;Instead of a wild and frantic rockabilly number, the original version was more of a hillbilly song, performed by one guy with a guitar. &nbsp;The title was indeed "B-I-Bickey-Bi-Bo-Bo-Boo," which seemed just plain strange after hearing Gene Vincent sing it differently for so many years.<br /><br />I contacted some of my record collecting friends and asked them what they thought of this acetate. &nbsp;Eventually I was put in touch with David Dennard, who was compiling rare Gene Vincent material for a disc of unreleased live and studio performances, "The Lost Dallas Sessions," for his Dragon Street label. &nbsp;David had unearthed some mindblowing stuff and was doing a lot of research on the years that Gene Vincent had based himself in Dallas, 1957-1958.<br /><br />David was also putting together a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Dallas-Sessions-1957-58-Gene-Vincent/dp/B000007NGU">compilation</a> of original versions and demos of Gene Vincent songs, and he lost his mind when I told him the story of finding the "B-I-Bickey-Bi-Bo-Bo-Boo" acetate at Roy Harte's Drum City.<br /><br />I had heard of songwriter Jack Rhodes before, but until David told me the story, I was unaware that quite a few of Gene Vincent's songs (and a bunch of other great rockabilly songs) had originated in Texas under what can only be described as bizarre, primitive circumstances. <br /><br />Jack Rhodes lived in the small East Texas town of Mineola, about 90 miles east of Dallas. &nbsp;There was nothing particularly interesting about the town except for Jack Rhodes himself and his hillbilly musician buddies. &nbsp;As with so many entrepreneurs in those days, Jack Rhodes decided to get into the music business utilizing not much more than mere bluster and brash self-confidence.<br /><br />Below: a vintage postcard for Jack Rhodes' Trail 80 Motel.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a

restaurant, and gas station complex just off the highway in Mineola. &nbsp;From the manager's office, Rhodes set up a primitive recording studio with one microphone and a Magnecord tape recorder. &nbsp;Although it seems unlikely in today's world, in the wild and wooly era of post-war country music, a guy like Jack Rhodes had as much chance as anybody else, as long as he shook hands and hustled songs and wrote letters and greased palms. &nbsp;It was a different era, to be sure.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a

&nbsp;After scoring minor hits with Jim Reeves and a monster smash with "A Satisfied Mind" for Porter Wagoner (also recorded by Jean Sheperd for Capitol), a flock of amateur songwriters and performers began making their way to Mineola to become a part of Rhodes' hillbilly empire. &nbsp;Dick Reynolds, Don Carter, Jimmy Johnson, Derrell Felts, Johnny Dollar and more hopefuls all became part of Rhodes' operation.<br /><br />Jack Rhodes became involved with Ken Nelson at Capitol Records and Cliffie Stone at Central Songs publishing, and for a time in the mid-to-late 1950s, Central Songs had the first right of refusal on any songs that Jack Rhodes came up with. &nbsp;Although Jack Rhodes and his buddies were country-western fans to their core, when Elvis Presley started selling millions of records with his wild Southern blend of rockabilly music, Jack Rhodes and his songwriting stable took a stab at the new music.<br /><br />Jimmy Johnson, a country singer who recorded a great slice of hillbilly bop with Jack Rhodes' band in 1952 for Columbia Records ("I've Lived A Lot In My Time"/"Eternity") got the rockabilly bug first, recording a killer two-sided primitive bopper on Starday Records in 1956, "Woman Love"/"All Dressed Up." &nbsp;The Starday record sold poorly, but "Woman Love" caught the attention of Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, who decided it would be a good candidate for a Capitol Rock and Roll release. (Author's note: the forgotten flip side "All Dressed Up" has become a rockabilly standard in recent times, and it has become a staple of this author's live performances)<br /><br />Gene Vincent (real name: Vincent Eugene Craddock) won a singing contest in his hometown of Portsmouth, Virginia, and subsequently demoed a song he had written called "Be-Bop-A-Lulu" for local country DJ "Sherriff Tex" Davis (real name: Wilfred Douchette). &nbsp;Davis took an acetate dub of the song and sent it to a better-connected DJ from Atlanta, Georgia named Bill Lowery. &nbsp;Lowery sent in Vincent's crude dub of "Be-Bop-A-Lulu" to Ken Nelson at Capitol Records. &nbsp;Nelson thought the song was okay, but heard Elvis Presley-type potential in Vincent's voice. &nbsp;Nelson thought Jack Rhodes' "Woman Love" was the song with potential, and he wanted Vincent to record it. &nbsp;Arrangements were made to meet in Nashville at Owen Bradley's studio two weeks later.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Vincent was an amateur singer with only a few local appearances to his name, "Sheriff Tex" Davis promoted Vincent as the next big thing over the phone to Ken Nelson. &nbsp;It was a prudent move, as Capitol Records was desperately seeking a Rock and Roll singer to sign to their label. &nbsp;Elvis Presley was breaking all sales records in the industry, and Capitol Records was a label whose roster was filled with hillbilly and pop artists. &nbsp;Being in the right place at the right time put small time players such as Jack Rhodes, Bill Lowery and "Sheriff Tex" Davis into a feeding frenzy, throwing stuff at the wall, hoping it would stick.<br /><br />Gene Vincent and "Be-Bop-A-Lula," as it was subsequently retitled, would stick. &nbsp;The song went to the top five on the national charts and became a well-known rock and roll standard still remembered today. &nbsp;It was such a huge hit for Capitol Records that the label kept releasing singles and albums on Vincent until 1963, even though his sales declined sharply after his very first release until his last.&nbsp; Gene Vincent was a rock and roll legend, and even had his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (paid for by Capitol Records), but he would forever chase the high tide of "Be-Bop-A-Lula."<br /><br />Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps, "Be Bop A Lula" (from the movie "The Girl Can't Help It," 1956:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Just turn on the History Channel and watch endless hours of programming deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics, Norse runes, Paleolithic cave paintings, and other mysterious forms of communication that humans left as proof of their existence.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">With all the attention given such ancient artifacts, given a sense of perspective one can?t help but realize that these amazing glimpses into previous epochs were no big deal to the people who lived in those times.&nbsp; Cave paintings?&nbsp; Undoubtedly the graffiti of some bored everyman stuck in a cave during a cold spell.&nbsp; Rune stones?&nbsp; The ones that have surfaced tell of general events of the day, the scratched-stone equivalent of a local newspaper.&nbsp; Egyptian artifacts?&nbsp; The Egyptians meant for their dead to stay buried, not looted by thieves and dissected by scientists.&nbsp; The point is, none of these people thought that they were leaving something behind that would be intensely studied by future generations, keen on unlocking the secrets of their society.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">With that in mind, I began wondering to myself about the present.&nbsp; We as Americans have been raised at birth to think of ourselves as the center of the universe, but other than a few marble monuments and presidents carved into the side of a mountain, what symbols and signs would we leave for future generations to decipher who we were?<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The answer, I came to realize, is that in the last two hundred years or so, most of what we?ve left behind are things made of paper, plastic, wood, and other mediums that will not survive into the future the same way that rune stones and cave paintings have.&nbsp; For instance, McDonald?s restaurants are undoubtedly the most revealing look into American eating habits of the present day, but would any evidence of McDonald?s survive two thousand years?&nbsp; I suppose if you count the Styrofoam containers they used to put McDonald?s hamburgers in back in the 1980's, you?re probably right.&nbsp; The legacy of the McDonald?s brand, however, is a different story.&nbsp; The buildings, advertising, and products themselves are made of stucco, particle board, paper, cardboard, and other things that wouldn?t survive a couple of bad winters, much less a millennium.&nbsp; I?m guessing a thousand years from now some kid will dig up a Happy Meal toy of the <a href="http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/hamburglar_2.jpg">Hamburglar</a> in his back yard, and it will be sent to a university for study of its meaning (this assumption based on the hopeful premise that McDonald?s will have disappeared from the planet in a thousand years).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Now that much of our society and human interaction has gone online and digital, the distinction (and the shelf-life) is even greater.&nbsp;

In the Valley?s great area of population, there is no central gathering place, no downtown, no real sense of self?just a hundred little villages from the earlier part of the Twentieth Century that all grew into each other to form one dazzlingly large single-cell organism, like a fungi of unbridled capitalism and humankind.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Across the hill in the greater Los Angeles basin, Hollywood hipsters have the luxury of walking out the front door to find piss-soaked winos in their doorway, or the window broken out in their car, stereo removed.&nbsp;

I thought about how many rune stones had been repurposed into making buildings or stone walls, and how they used to have so many mummies in Egypt that you could actually buy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_paper">ground-up mummies to use as paper pulp, brown dye, and a medicinal supplement</a> (true).&nbsp; The whole trick with a society and their symbols is that when that society was active, these things were commonplace.&nbsp; The symbols gain meaning when the society disappears, and there are only a few examples left of their symbols to study.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

After doing a fair amount of research, I couldn?t find any exact corollaries with the Valley symbols.&nbsp; A complete perusal of <a href="http://symbols.com/">Symbols.com</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://symboldictionary.com/">SymbolDictionary.com</a> found several close matches, one of which pointed to an ancient chemical symbol for Vitriol, another that revealed an ancient Mariner symbol for a Buddhist temple, and another that indicated the design of an ancient Swedish board game.&nbsp; None of these seemed like the San Fernando Valley homebuilder?s intent.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It?s possible that the design was borrowed from a generic architect?s vision of a Buddhist temple symbol, but in true L.A. fashion the symbols are on houses with an Oriental theme, as well as houses with a Colonial flair, and on houses that look like a 1950?s flying saucer.&nbsp; If there was supposed to be an Asian motif behind the symbol in the first place, these builders apparently didn?t seem to care.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">I tend to think that the designs are meant to be Asian, or in that great California way, meant to make you <i>feel an Asian feeling</i>. &nbsp;On the other hand, the only time I've seen something eerily similar was on a trip to England, on a random house outside London.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Perhaps they don?t mean anything.&nbsp; It very well could be that the homebuilders of the 1950?s and 1960?s just needed quickie decorative elements on the outside of the houses they were throwing up in slapdash fashion.&nbsp; Maybe, but the amount of variation and creativity displayed in the many designs suggests there is more to it than that.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">I prefer to think that in some ?Mad Men? architect?s office fifty years ago, there was an operative of the Illuminati whose mission it was to impart a campaign of secret symbols throughout the Valley.&nbsp; Several hundred years from now, some author will write a ?Da Vinci Code?-type novel based on the secret symbols of the San Fernando Valley, finally deciphering what these ubiquitous, yet mysterious, symbols were trying to tell us all along.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;

Listening to his own show on KOPN, I vividly remember the first time I ever heard Louis Jordan?on a two-hour special dedicated to Jordan?s music.&nbsp; Thinking about this now, it boggles the mind?who dedicates a two hour timeslot to Louis Jordan in the wilderness days of the early 1980s?&nbsp;

In fact, his blues soloing made me dream about killing him, so that I would never have to hear his guitar playing ever again.&nbsp; When he told me that I had to quit listening to Buddy Holly if I ever wanted to get any better on the guitar, I promptly quit taking guitar lessons (and I still love Buddy Holly).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Bill Wax convinced me, a jaded 13-year old snot-nosed rockabilly kid, that real black blues music was ?the shit,? to use his term.&nbsp; He turned me on to lowdown guys like Howlin? Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Elmore James, as well as uptown guys like Louis Jordan and Bobby ?Blue? Bland.&nbsp; I still remember hearing Howlin? Wolf sing for the first time.&nbsp; It scared the hell out of me, it sounded violent and wicked and like a scream set to music.&nbsp; That was the moment when I knew that Howlin?

is a tour-de-force that modern slap-bass players use as the benchmark of slap bass acrobatics.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Willie also produced records at Chess, something that went unaccredited back in the day.&nbsp; Many of the classic recordings made at Chess sounded the way they did because of Willie?s arranging skills, or his advice on how things should be done.&nbsp; The Chess Brothers paid Willie, but nothing like what he should have been paid for the influence he had on these million-selling records.&nbsp; In the end, Willie Dixon had the last laugh?long after the Chess empire had gone bankrupt, Willie Dixon?s estate bought the former Chess studios at 2120 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and turned the place into a museum run by Willie?s family.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">When I found out about Willie Dixon coming to town, I begged my dad to take me to the Blue Note to see the show.&nbsp; The legal age to get into the club was twenty-one.&nbsp; There was no way I could go.&nbsp; I begged and begged and cajoled and pleaded.&nbsp; Somehow or another, through Bill Wax and a few other people in town that liked me, my dad talked the owners of the Blue Note (Phil Costello and Richard King) into letting me into the club to see the show, as a sort of ?cultural education? project.&nbsp; I remember hearing my dad talking on the phone, promising Costello that he would personally watch me and make sure I didn?t drink.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><a href="http://www.thebluenote.com/">The Blue Note</a> is still there, in my hometown, and it is still the premier live music venue in one of the biggest college towns in the Midwest (the University of Missouri has its primary campus in Columbia).&nbsp; Today the Blue Note occupies a huge converted movie theater in downtown Columbia, where a thousand people can come to see national headlining acts.&nbsp; Back in the early 1980s, however, the club occupied a spot in a seedy strip along the Business Loop, in a sweat-and-beer-infused cinderblock room that held 250 people on a really good night.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Blue Note was part of a long established ?chittlin? circuit? that slowly evolved into a ?college circuit? as time went by.&nbsp; The circuit roughly went from Chicago to St. Louis to Columbia to Kansas City to Lincoln and/or Omaha, down to Tulsa, Oklahoma City and then Texas.&nbsp; This particular circuit must have started back in the days when the highway system was first evolving, and then it turned into a ?follow the money? situation where a lot of live acts played that route because of the lucrative college gigs in each of these towns.&nbsp; When I was first going to shows in the 1980s, it was interesting to see old blues guys obviously playing the same towns on what was their old ?chittlin? circuit,? in the same week that a new upstart band like R.E.M. or The Replacements was playing at the same club.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Most people would qualify the original Blue Note as a ?dive,? but to a 13-year old kid with stars in his eyes, it was a magical palace of wonderment.&nbsp; My dad parked his car in the large gravel parking lot, and we went inside and sat at a wobbly table on duct-tape covered vinyl seats.&nbsp; After hearing the ?grownups? at the radio station talk about the Blue Note for the better part of a year, I couldn?t believe I was actually inside the place, getting ready to hear live music!&nbsp; By god, I was excited.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The opening act was a local blues act called The Bel-Airs, who, like the Blue Note nightclub, are still around today.&nbsp; Led by two brothers, Dave and Dick Pruitt, the Bel-Airs were white guys, but they weren?t hippie blues wankers.&nbsp; I would eventually see the Bel-Airs hundreds of times, but this was my first time seeing them live in person.&nbsp; They were great, covering vintage blues songs, mixing it up with a few rockabilly classics like Warren Smith?s ?Uranium Rock?

Murphy, Buddy Guy, Johnny Copeland, and many more during this era.&nbsp; Most of them followed the same formula?a half-baked ?warm-up? set by the backing band, followed by the bluesman doing a short set of classics with one or two songs from the inevitable ?new album,? and then a strong-armed, grifter-esque hustle to buy their incredibly overpriced merchandise after the show.&nbsp;

He refused because I hadn?t bought anything from his merchandise stall.&nbsp; When I opened my wallet and showed him that this little punk-ass white kid literally had no money in his wallet, John Lee Hooker growled at me like an caged lion, angrily grabbed my poster and ?wrote? a slash mark across it, as if he were a pissed-off drug dealer in a hurry to get to his second job as a pimp.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, John Lee Hooker was selling cassette tapes at his show for twenty dollars?TWENTY DOLLARS?in an era where they usually retailed for five.&nbsp; I think my defaced poster (which I still own) and the story I?ve been telling for thirty years was a much better bargain in the long run.&nbsp;

After a while, everybody at the Blue Note knew me anyway, and most of the time I was waved in without having to pay.&nbsp; I was incredibly blessed and fortunate to grow up seeing blues, country music, rock and roll, punk rock, soul, jazz, and just about any other form of music you could imagine.&nbsp;

and ?K&amp;F? guitars were Doc and Leo-produced instruments).&nbsp; Doc Kauffmann also made a series of ?Kremo-Kustom? guitars, which looked quite similar to the Johnny Meeks triple-neck guitar.&nbsp; Doc made Kremo-Kustom double-necks and triple-necks, and used a black and white color scheme.&nbsp; My first thought was that Meeks' triple-neck almost certainly had to be a Doc Kauffmann Kremo-Kustom instrument.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Below: A Doc Kauffmann Kremo-Kustom triple-neck guitar.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UlapvweAfPs/Tc9WQU46zfI/AAAAAAAAAO8/yAVluSPFy64/s1600/KremoKustomTriple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UlapvweAfPs/Tc9WQU46zfI/AAAAAAAAAO8/yAVluSPFy64/s640/KremoKustomTriple.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Johnny Meeks is still with us.&nbsp; He is not an easy guy to find, but not because of stardom or any ill will towards his fans.&nbsp; The truth is that he lives in a small town in South Carolina, doesn?t have a computer, doesn?t have a cell phone, and he likes it that way.&nbsp; Meeks spent years in Los Angeles hammering away at the clubs, doing stints in various touring bands (Meeks played with The Champs of ?Tequila?

What makes such a statement ironic is that while the teenage-themed pop-a-billy sides he waxed in the late 1950s were forced upon him and bear the authenticity of such, the fact remains that Faron Young?s hillbilly boogie songs of the early and mid 1950s were as influential to the new crop of rockabillies as anything else, with their braggadocio lyrical content and aggressive boogie-woogie guitar-based sound.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What got Faron Young into music was his lifelong need for attention.&nbsp; He began entering amateur contests at a young age, singing pop songs and picking coins off the stage for pay, but appears to have been steered into the country music world when a man offered him five dollars to sing </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Jambalaya</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">, instead of the twenty-five cents he was used to receiving for a typical pop request.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Faron?s quick rise to fame in the country music world can be explained quite simply?he was a good looking young man in the right place (Shreveport, home to the Louisiana Hayride) at the right time (the peak of Hank Williams popularity), with an unquenchable thirst to </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">be somebody</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">.&nbsp;

As legend has it, Faron had a small bit of experience playing the clubs around Shreveport, but had great aspirations even from the start.&nbsp; His first break came when he auditioned songs for local star Webb Pierce.&nbsp; Rather than buying the compositions, Pierce instead liked Faron?s singing voice and began paying Faron to warm up his shows and sing for him when he got too drunk or tired (This is a time-honored tradition in the country music world.&nbsp; The position is called ?front man? and is as ubiquitous in the country music world as a rapper?s ?posse? is in the realm of hip-hop).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faron stayed with Pierce for about a year as his front man, long enough for Pierce to get him on the Louisiana Hayride show, and to get Faron his first recording contract, with the tiny Pacemaker-Gotham label of Philadelphia (the same label that Pierce?s initial releases were on).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Faron?s three releases on the Pacemaker-Gotham label didn?t sell at all outside of the local area, but again luck seemed to be on Faron?s side.&nbsp; Capitol Records A&amp;R man Ken Nelson (a legendary figure responsible for signing the Louvin Brothers, Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Gene Vincent and others to the label) heard a live broadcast by Pierce and Faron as he was driving to Dallas.&nbsp; Knowing that Pierce was signed to Decca, but sensing that the young singer might be available, Nelson turned his car around and drove back to Shreveport, where he offered Faron a Capitol recording contract on the spot.&nbsp;

Opry in the summer of 1952 (where Faron was invited to join the cast as a semi-regular guest).&nbsp; Billie Jean came to Nashville as Faron?s date and wound up marrying Hank Williams.&nbsp; Billie Jean would marry Johnny Horton after Hank?s death and became known in the country music world as ?The Black Widow? after Horton?s tragic death in 1960.&nbsp; Asked if he had any bitter feelings about losing Billie Jean to Hank, Faron would </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">state ?I sure am glad ol?

The strongest criticism that may be leveled of Faron Young?s musical career is that he was willing to do anything, follow any direction, to be successful in the music business.&nbsp; When hillbilly boogie was the fashion, he cut great records like the ones mentioned above.&nbsp; When pop music appeared to be the new trend, he made horrific records like </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Shrine Of St. Cecilia</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">, which thankfully bombed or we wouldn?t speak of Faron in such glowing terms today!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of which goes a long way to explain why Faron was dragged kicking and screaming into the world of rock &amp; roll.&nbsp; Ken Nelson, the A&amp;R man for Capitol who had signed Faron, showed Faron how well singers like Elvis Presley and Capitol?s new star Gene Vincent were selling in comparison to the country roster.&nbsp; Faron?s fortunes had been dwindling since rock &amp; roll had reared its head, and in his words, he would rather sing rock &amp; roll than be poor.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The instrumental backing on these and his other forays into rockabilly and rock &amp; roll are simply superb?the Nashville A-Team at their rocking best.&nbsp; However, Faron?s vocals sound exactly like what they are?a country singer being forced to step into Presley territory and not liking it one bit.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By the late 1950s, Faron seemed to be back on track. Perhaps rekindled by the chart success of Ray Price, Faron began recording hard honky-tonk numbers like </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Alone With You</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> and </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">That?s the Way I Feel</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">.&nbsp; Such records kept an almost rockabilly-esque delivery, but which featured a return to the twin fiddles and steel guitar sound.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the excellent material Faron recorded around this time came from the members of his road band, which included future superstars Roger Miller on drums and Johnny Paycheck (then known as Donny Young) on bass.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faron also brought along a host of new and inexperienced ?front men,? many of whom would later become stars.&nbsp; From the Wilburn Brothers to Jimmy &amp; Johnny to Gordon Terry and others, Faron had a knack for picking out young, super talents, and many of these afore-mentioned stars got their first break touring as Faron?s front men.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another one of Faron?s unknown discoveries was a young Texas songwriter by the name of Willie Nelson.&nbsp; Willie was another knockabout who spent time touring with Faron, Ray Price, and others, all the while composing songs that he would pitch to those who would listen, and toiling in near obscurity as a writer for Pamper Music in Nashville.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faron was most certainly listening when he heard a new Willie composition from a Pamper Music demo, entitled </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hello Walls</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">.&nbsp; His firm belief in the song (even as the studio musicians poked fun at it during the recording session, and as Willie tried to sell the song outright to Faron for a few hundred dollars) paid off when </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hello Walls</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> became the biggest hit, and defining song of his career.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One part Ray Price shuffle, one part classic Willie introspection, and one part pop music, </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hello Walls</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> could be considered the definitive example of where Nashville was headed in the early 1960s.&nbsp; Lush orchestration and smooth backing vocals took the place of steel guitars and twin fiddles.&nbsp; The rural edges were sanded off and smoothed down for mass consumption.&nbsp; Faron was there, and ready to cash in on it, and again he milked this new style for all it was worth, recording several other Willie Nelson compositions in an attempt to cash in on a follow-up.&nbsp; He even re-recorded his first hit </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Goin?

Unfortunately, Faron?s need to be in the spotlight ultimately led to his demise.&nbsp; When he was no longer drawing the crowds, when the phone stopped ringing, and when the records quit charting, Faron made the decision to take his own life, on December 10, 1996.&nbsp; It was a very sad end to one of the greats of Country Music.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Deke Dickerson, with thanks to Colin Escott</span></span><o:p></o:p></div><!--EndFragment-->";s:12:"link_replies";s:167:"http://muleskinner.blogspot.com/feeds/1342882354913422939/comments/defaulthttp://muleskinner.blogspot.com/2011/05/faron-young-live-fast-love-hard-die.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/804177363231555459/posts/default/1342882354913422939";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/804177363231555459/posts/default/1342882354913422939";s:4:"link";s:80:"http://muleskinner.blogspot.com/2011/05/faron-young-live-fast-love-hard-die.html";s:11:"author_name";s:14:"Deke Dickerson";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/05102841468714254860";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:11;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-804177363231555459.post-7966778779391625459";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-05-08T22:47:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-05-08T22:47:52.271-07:00";s:5:"title";s:40:"JOHNNY HORTON--Honky Tonk Man of Mystery";s:12:"atom_content";s:54963:"<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>The strange and wonderful story of Johnny Horton, the "Honky Tonk Man."</b> (From the Bear Family CD, 'Johnny Horton--Gonna Shake This Shack Tonight.')<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

It is safe to say that Johnny Horton is the only country music legend who was born in Los Angeles, never touched alcohol, was completely bald and wore an ill-fitting hairpiece, and had a strange obsession with spiritualism and dying violently.&nbsp; Moreover, Johnny Horton had spent ten years clawing and scratching, making dozens of records in as many different styles, before he finally hit upon the style that made him so remembered today.&nbsp; As quickly as he became famous, a cruel twist of fate took him in a violent car wreck, just as his career finally reached the grand successes he had dreamed of for so long.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Despite Horton?s unusual personal story, what we?re left with fifty years later is the voice?a voice so calm and reassuring, it?s hard to connect the Johnny Horton we know with the troubled Johnny Horton who walked the earth.&nbsp; One thing cannot be denied, however, the voice of Johnny Horton appealed to millions of people, and continues to appeal decades after his death.&nbsp; This compilation puts together a playlist of some of Johnny?s best uptempo hillbilly, honky-tonk and rockabilly music.&nbsp;

Both parties had taken publishing on Horton in exchange for recommending him to the label.&nbsp; If that injustice weren?t enough, the royalty rate promised to Horton was so low that he probably would have made more money as a mechanic.&nbsp; Still, it was a recording contract, and the records would be made at the strictly big-time Owen Bradley Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp; Johnny Horton?s only other alternative was a day job, so he took the offer, as inglorious as it was.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Johnny and Tillman had two Aces up their sleeve before they arrived at the studio in Nashville to record their first session.&nbsp; The first Ace was a song called </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Honky Tonk Man</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">, written by a hopeful named Howard Hausey aka ?Howard Crockett,? who pitched the song to Johnny backstage at the ?Louisiana Hayride.?&nbsp; Johnny and Tillman loved the song and knew it had hit potential, and in fact it was the first song that they recorded for Columbia.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The second Ace that Johnny and Tillman brought to the studio was a musician who would give their sparse trio a hit sound.&nbsp; By studying session sheets it can be revealed that Elvis Presley was recording his first RCA session in Nashville on January 11, 1956.&nbsp; Presley recorded until 7 pm that evening, at which point Tillman Franks brought Elvis? bass player <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Black">Bill Black</a> over to Owen Bradley?s studio for a session beginning at 8 pm, where Black?s slap bass prowess can be heard on </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Honky Tonk Man</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"> and the others recorded that evening.&nbsp; Tillman and Johnny knew Bill Black from Elvis? many appearances at the Hayride, and it seems that they had made a deal to spirit Bill Black away for the evening to help out Johnny?s first Columbia session.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">As with all moments of greatness, what transpired in the studio that day was a combination of many things that equaled a sum greater than its individual parts.&nbsp; Tillman and Johnny had the drive and the hunger, Johnny had the voice, Howard Hausey had supplied the song, Bill Black?s slapping bass added an element of sound that Tillman could not, and the glue that held it all together was the highly-stylized and steady lead guitar of session man (and de facto producer) Grady Martin.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Grady Martin was Nashville?s top session guitarist for decades.&nbsp; While there were undoubtedly other guitarists that could out-flash Grady, or venture off into jazz or blues, the fact was that Grady Martin could listen to a singer demo a song and come up with the individual licks that would turn that song into a hit.&nbsp; Other guitarists in Nashville could come close, but none had that hit-making ability that Grady innately possessed.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: Grady Martin, holding his 1952 Bigsby doubleneck guitar, as heard on the Johnny Horton recordings. &nbsp;The amp is a Magnatone, in case you're wondering.</span></o:p></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

For some quick cash, Horton cut an album for the fledgling SESAC publishing and recording firm in Nashville with his road band, including Tommy Tomlinson on guitar (a fine guitarist in his own right, he was forced to play rhythm guitar on the Columbia sides and learn Grady Martin?s leads for Johnny?s personal appearances).&nbsp;

Davis escaped with a broken rib, but Tommy Tomlinson lost a leg, Tillman Franks suffered head lacerations, and the great honky-tonk singing star Johnny Horton lay dead on a lonesome stretch of Texas highway.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: Johnny Horton's grave, just&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">outside of Shreveport, Louisiana.</span></o:p></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MYUGOwZs_iQ/Tcd8kVvlvyI/AAAAAAAAANk/F8zby45wEB0/s1600/Johnny_Horton_grave_in_Haughton%252C_LA_IMG_2639.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MYUGOwZs_iQ/Tcd8kVvlvyI/AAAAAAAAANk/F8zby45wEB0/s640/Johnny_Horton_grave_in_Haughton%252C_LA_IMG_2639.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Ironically, as with Buddy Holly, Patsy Cline, and Jim Reeves, Johnny Horton?s fame and fortune multiplied exponentially after his tragic death.&nbsp; </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">North To Alaska</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">, which had only been released a short time before the accident, went to the top of the charts, and rushed-to-market Johnny Horton cash-in albums sold like hotcakes.&nbsp; Though he would not be around to enjoy it, Johnny Horton had become what he always wanted?a timeless, beloved, and legendary country star.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">After Horton?s death, the vaults were raided, and unreleased songs would continue to be released for years to come.&nbsp; A stash of home recorded demos turned up, and several of these were overdubbed by the Nashville A-Team and released on album. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Although Johnny Horton?s personal life was filled with huge successes, hard times, and a tragic early death, fifty years later we are left with the voice?that magical voice that has calmed and soothed and entertained millions over the years.&nbsp; Magic like that can?t be manufactured?something that today?s flash in the pan singers should take note of.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Akzp1W9oj2s/Tcd02me-WKI/AAAAAAAAAM4/NHdsx5Fkor8/s1600/johnny_horton-the_spectacular%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Akzp1W9oj2s/Tcd02me-WKI/AAAAAAAAAM4/NHdsx5Fkor8/s640/johnny_horton-the_spectacular%25282%2529.jpg" width="620" /></span></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">We hope you have enjoyed this compilation of Johnny Horton?s best hillbilly boogie and proto-rockabilly material.&nbsp; If this is your introduction to the music of Johnny Horton, we would like to recommend the two excellent Johnny Horton box sets on Bear Family (?The Early Years?

She had one of those big old console stereos, ordered from Sears, and one of her favorite record albums was a compilation of older country hits. I would sit and listen intently for hours, but one song by one artist in particular truly perplexed my fragile young psyche. The song was "You Don't Want My Love (In the Summertime)" and whenever the singer would start scatting the solo, sounding completely incoherent, going into a falsetto punctuated by sounds resembling Donald Duck, I just didn't know what to think.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"That's Roger Miller," my granny explained with a chuckle. "He's CRAZY!"</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">See and hear a live version of "In The Summertime" with awesome scatting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRuzBp7eIP8">HERE</a>.</span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Roger Miller was the most unlikely of country music super stars. Although he led the sort of extreme wild-man existence that no grandmother could ever comprehend, he somehow was able to charm the pants off the entire nation with his immense wit and original song style. Miller could have made it on any one of his talents-songwriter, comedian, singer, entertainer, actor-but his hyperactive creativity couldn't be tempered until he had excelled in all of his pursuits. By the mid-1960s Miller was hot as a pistol, with an NBC television special, his own regular TV show, a mantel full of Grammy awards, and a string of huge hits including "Chug-a-Lug," "Dang Me," "Engine Engine #9," and of course his career-defining hit "King of the Road."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It took less than ten years for Miller to come from nowhere and arrive at the top of the hill. As with others who have achieved monumental success, the story of how he got there was an interesting one. Until now, not much attention has been paid to Roger Miller's early recordings. This collection attempts to rectify the situation, gathering together all of his early sides from his very first session in 1957 up to the time he signed with RCA-Victor in 1960.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Though Miller could lay claim to being a Texan, having been born in Fort Worth on January 2, 1936, his father, Jean Miller, died when he was only a year old, and his mother Laudene had to farm her three boys out to Jean's family. Roger went to Erick, Oklahoma, to live with his Uncle Elmer and Aunt Armelia Miller, and today Erick proudly proclaims itself the home of Roger Miller, even hosting a Roger Miller <a href="http://www.rogermillermuseum.com/">museum</a> downtown!</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Miller remembered his upbringing in small-town Oklahoma as "so dull you could watch the colors run." Between working in the fields, walking three miles to school, and feeling lonely and cut off from his mother's love, life was hard for him. Nonetheless, he exhibited a bright mind from an early age, making up songs on his long walk to school. His loneliness and isolation helped fuel his creative drive. "We were dirt poor," he once told an interviewer. "What I'd do is sit around and get warm by crawling inside myself and make up stuff. . . . I was one of those kids that never had much to say and when I did it was wrong. I always wanted attention, always was reaching and grabbing for attention."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Release eventually came in the form of his cousin Melva's husband, Sheb Wooley (yes, the same <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9H_cI_WCnE">Sheb Wooley</a> who later had a huge hit with "Purple People Eater" in 1958 and a string of hits under the pseudonym Ben Colder in the 1960s). Wooley was fifteen years older than Miller and was a powerful mentor to the young miscreant, encouraging him to take up music as a creative outlet. Wooley was the first one in the family to make a dent in the music business, making records for Bullet in 1945 and MGM beginning in 1950. He moved to California in the mid-'50s, and in addition to making records he also worked as an actor in countless low-budget westerns and television shows. It must have seemed terribly exciting to the young Miller, stuck in the Dust Bowl of the Oklahoma prairie.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">(Side note: Sheb Wooley is also acknowledged as the man who did the "Wilhelm Scream," the iconic dying "Aaaaaggghhh" heard in countless movies. &nbsp;Read about this interesting history of the sound clip <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream">HERE</a>)</span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Miller spent countless hours listening to the radio, from the Grand Ole Opry to the Light Crust Doughboys, daydreaming about Wooley's exciting life out in California. Soaking up influences from what he heard, he eventually declared Bob Wills and Hank Williams to be his favorite artists. When Wooley came back to Oklahoma to visit, he helped Miller by showing him chords on the guitar, and he bought him his first fiddle. Eventually wanderlust got the best of Miller, and he began traveling as far as he could run away, getting odd jobs during the day and listening to music at the honky-tonks by night. His desire to become part of the professional music world led him to steal a guitar in Texas, which he reckoned was the only way he would ever be able to own one.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">After he was caught (or turned himself in, depending on which story you believe), the judge gave him the option of jail or joining the army. Though he was only seventeen at the time, he chose the latter and was immediately shipped off to the conflict in Korea. According to Miller, "My education was Korea, clash of '52." By the time he arrived at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Georgia, to finish his stint in the army, his talents as a musician had become known and he joined his first band, the Circle A Wranglers, on fiddle. The Circle A Wranglers were an armed services outfit that already had one famous alumnus--Faron Young--who later would be one of Miller's first professional employers.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Bolstered by this experience, Miller headed straight for Nashville after his release from the army. The first thing he did when he hit town was to walk right into Chet Atkins's office and announce that he was a songwriter. Atkins handed him his guitar and asked him to play something, at which point Miller became completely overwhelmed that he was in Chet Atkins's office playing Chet Atkins's very guitar. According to Miller, "I was so nervous, people thought I was wavin'!" Although he flubbed the audition, Atkins told him to work on his songs and come back to see him when he had it together.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Undaunted, Miller got a job as a bellhop at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in downtown Nashville. He was so eager to sing his songs to anyone who would listen that he became known as the Singing Bellhop, a tag that would stick with him for years. "It had more dignity than washing dishes," he would say later. The job put him in the thick of the bustling downtown music activity, and indeed his Singing Bellhop shtick served to get him noticed. He caught his first break when Minnie Pearl offered him a job as fiddle player in her touring road band.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">After that ended, his next opportunity came when he met George Jones at a late-night session on WSM. Miller played Jones some of his songs, and Jones was sufficiently impressed to recommend him to Don Pierce and Pappy Daily of Starday Records, the label that Jones was recording for at the time. Miller auditioned for Pierce and Daily at the Andrew Jackson Hotel, and they agreed to record him at their studio, Gold Star, in Houston. Miller rode from Nashville to Texas with Jones, and on the way they wrote songs together, including "Tall, Tall Trees," which Jones recorded soon thereafter, and "Happy Child," which was recorded by future sausage magnate Jimmy Dean (it was the first of Miller's compositions to be committed to wax).</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Gold Star Studios in Houston (no relation to the Los Angeles-based Gold Star, but rather a Texas independent still in business today as Sugar Hill Studios) was at the time an extremely primitive recording studio situated in a corrugated tin barn. Lined with egg cartons and equipped with the most basic of monaural equipment, it was nonetheless a hit-making institution. George Jones had recorded all of his earliest hits there, including "Why Baby Why" and "Window Up Above." It had also been host to countless rockabilly and country obscurities. Unfortunately, Roger Miller's debut single would fall into the latter category.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"Poor Little John" b/w "My Pillow" was released as Mercury-Starday 71212 in fall 1957. "Poor Little John" was a great Cajun-meets-rockabilly uptempo number, and "My Pillow" (sometimes listed only as "Pillow") was a superb country weeper; both were written by Miller. The same session produced "You're Forgetting Me" and "Can't Stop Loving You," two more Miller originals that were released as Starday 356, but copies are so rare that this author didn't believe it existed until recently, when a legitimate one surfaced. Both singles were re-released in the mid-'60s to cash in on Miller's success, but original copies of both are exceedingly rare.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Starday discs went nowhere, and though Miller continued to pen tunes for George Jones and several other Starday artists, he became discouraged with the music business. When his first wife, Barbara, announced that she was pregnant, Miller decided to get a day job to support his new family and moved to Amarillo to join the fire department. While this move today sounds like the plot of a sitcom (Roger Miller as a fireman?), he worked at the fire department during the day and continued playing music in the honky-tonks around Amarillo by night. With predictably comical results, he was soon relieved of his fireman duties around the same time that he was introduced to Ray Price at a local show.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The two kept in contact, and a few months later Miller was hired to replace Van Howard as Price's front man (a relatively thankless job that involved warming up the crowd to begin the show and also singing vocal harmonies with Price) in the Cherokee Cowboys. Miller and his wife moved back to Nashville, where he toured with Price and continued writing songs, including "Invitation to the Blues," which was recorded by both his boss and Rex Allen. Price's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIhywFlD2xY">version</a> became a number-three hit, and Roger Miller suddenly found himself not a struggling songwriter but a successful one. Grand Ole Opry bassist Buddy Killen signed Miller to a songwriting deal with Tree Publishing (still in business today as Sony/ATV publishing). Tree was a veritable gold mine of unknown talent that also employedfuture stars Johnny Paycheck (then known as <a href="http://muleskinner.blogspot.com/2011/04/johnny-paycheck-aka-donny-young-early.html">Donny Young</a>) and Bill Anderson as well as many other future notables. Miller wrote many hits during his tenure at Tree, including "Half a Mind" for Ernest Tubb, "That's the Way I Feel" for Faron Young, and "Home" and "Billy Bayou" for Jim Reeves.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">While he was establishing himself as a proven writer of hits, he also earned a well-deserved reputation as a loose cannon, and Buddy Killen was always after him to make a finished song out of the hundreds of brilliant scraps he left in his wake. Bill Anderson recalls, "Ernest Tubb wrote the last verse of 'Half a Mind' because Buddy couldn't get Roger to sit down and finish it. Roger was the most talented, and least disciplined, person that you could imagine. It was his personality. Roger was the closest thing to a genius I think I've ever known." Buddy Killen adds, "The songwriters in Nashville would follow him around and pick up his droppings because everything he said was a potential song. He spoke in songs."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Another of Miller's peers, Darrell McCall, said of his old friend, "Roger had what I call a double-barreled brain. He just thought differently than everybody else. If you rode along with him in a car, he'd be thinking of something from the back end forwards, for instance one of my favorite Roger quotes: 'I went to a fight last night and a dance broke out.' He just had a really unique way of looking at the world."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Miller became fast friends with Donny Young, aka Johnny Paycheck, and the two became infamous "roaring" buddies, staying up all night on a combination of uppers and pure nervous energy. Both managed to get signed to Decca as artists around the same time, with Miller contributing vocal harmonies to Paycheck's first single, "On This Mountain Top," recorded in September 1958. Paycheck sang harmonies on Miller's "A Man Like Me" b/w "The Wrong Kind of Girl," recorded three months later and released as Decca 9-30838. Both were excellent songwriting efforts by Miller. "A Man Like Me" stands the test of time as one of the finest honky-tonk records ever made, with superb production by Owen Bradley and his A-team session musicians. The flip was another brilliant weeper. Sadly, though Miller clearly poured his heart and soul into this record, it sank without a trace.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Six months later, on June 30, 1959, Miller again returned to Owen Bradley's studio, where he cut "Sweet Ramona" and "Jason Fleming," which were released as Decca 9-30953. "Sweet Ramona" was an attempt at a country pop hit, whereas <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSyYF9XpXrs">"Jason Fleming"</a> was as close as he ever got to rock and roll. The session logs for "Jason Fleming" say it was recorded between midnight and 2:30 a.m., which echoes the loose, party atmosphere of the record. The Bradley studio was really swinging that night, and session drummer Buddy Harman plays some of the best snare fills of his career on this one. Overall it's a marvelous record, one of the most infectious Miller ever cut, a solid gas from the first note to the last. While it's usually easy to say forty-plus years later that it "should have been a hit," the sad fact is that it's truly hard to figure out why "Jason Fleming" didn't click. It strongly foreshadows the sort of carefree, good-natured songs that Miller would take to the charts just a few years later, but when it was released in late 1959 it didn't make a dent. Miller (just like his buddy Donny Young) was soon dropped as a Decca recording artist.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">One reason for this alarming lack of success may have been that although Miller was a well-known songwriter around Nashville, he was still very much an unknown as a performer and didn't tour much under his own name. One story has Miller, Donny Young, and Bill Anderson setting out on their lone solo tour, only to end with Miller having to pawn his new portable record player (purchased so that the trio could listen to their own songs while on the road) for gas money home.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Back in Nashville, Miller had the dubious distinction of being a successful songwriter who had somehow managed to spend all of his royalties and was back to being broke. 1959 and 1960 were lean and somewhat desperate times, and like his buddies Donny Young and Darrell McCall he found himself taking on scab (nonunion) sessions, recording soundalike versions of current hits down at Starday (which had by this point established its own low-rent studio in Nashville) for ten bucks a pop. No doubt Miller needed the money, but those ten-dollar sessions came back to bite him a few years later. At the time a few of the songs were released on a couple of obscure, budget, top-hits-of-the-day discs with anonymous artist billing, but in 1965, after Miller was a real honest-to-goodness star, Starday issued everything they could dig up (save for one unreleased track, included here, "Hot Rod Lincoln") on a cash-in LP called</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Wild Child Roger Miller: Madcap Sensation of Country Music</span></span></i></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">(Starday SLP 318). No doubt fans of his recordings for RCA and Smash--big-budget, high fidelity, current-sounding discs--were in for a shock when they bought the Starday LP.

While it was a great relic for collectors, one can only imagine that Miller must have been less than thrilled when it was released.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: The Starday cash-in album of earlier material, released after his breakthrough success.</span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rznj6eQ1wuY/TcRREfdr_oI/AAAAAAAAAMs/q5ATckTHIl4/s1600/RogerMillerLP.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rznj6eQ1wuY/TcRREfdr_oI/AAAAAAAAAMs/q5ATckTHIl4/s640/RogerMillerLP.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">During the lean years of the late 1950s, Darrell McCall remembers, "If it hadn't been for Ray Price, Faron Young, and George Jones, we'd have all starved to death." One way to stay afloat was to sign on as a sideman with an established act. Faron Young recalled seeing Miller hanging out one day at Tootsie's Orchard Lounge, seemingly depressed. When Young asked him why he was so down, he replied it was because he didn't have a job. Young then asked if he was a drummer. "No, but when do you need one?" was Miller's reply. "Monday," replied Young. "Well," Miller responded, "Monday, I'm a drummer!" Young sent Miller to pick up a set of drums, and he toured as Young's drummer for over a year.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Faron Young also employed Miller's old buddies Donny Young and Darrell McCall, who had both carved a niche in the Nashville scene as excellent harmony singers and utility musicians. Their wild times on the road are legendary. McCall summarizes what it was like to tour with Young and all the boys together in a cramped station wagon: "I remember we crossed over into Mexico, and on the way back, Faron had to tell the border guard 'AMERICAN!' as we drove back over the border. Well, a short time later the same day, Roger and Donny were under a blanket in the back seat, smoking pot, and there was some kind of road construction going on. Faron, thinking it might be a police checkpoint, yelled at the two to stop what they were doing, and in something resembling a scene from a Cheech and Chong movie, Roger came out from underneath the blanket in a huge cloud of smoke, just in time to roll down his window and exclaim 'AMERICAN!' at the flagman just as we passed by."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It was during Miller's tenure with Faron Young that he signed his next record deal, with RCA-Victor. His success with songs he wrote for Jim Reeves brought him back to Chet Atkins's office, where he had flubbed his audition many years before. He had a new song that Buddy Killen was hot on, called "You Don't Want My Love." Killen suggested to Atkins that Miller should cut it himself, and in one of the least-corporate moves of his career, Atkins agreed.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Commonly known as "In the Summertime," "You Don't Want My Love" was released when Miller was still touring with Faron Young. Darrell McCall reveals that Young was intensely jealous of others' ambitions and told Miller many times he didn't have what it took to be a star in his own right. When Young played at Carnegie Hall weeks after "You Don't Want My Love" was released, he poked fun of his drummer to the audience and told him to come up and sing his new hit record, thinking he was setting Miller up for failure. "Roger got up there to the microphone and said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, I am the king fool,'" Darrell McCall remembers, "and when he sang 'You Don't Want My Love,' the place just went absolutely nuts for him. That night was the turning point. After that night, there was no doubt--Roger Miller was a star."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fx0OtAeytxU/TcRS2X0_85I/AAAAAAAAAMw/OOpy0oylaYs/s1600/a2d39b4085899e08_large.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="418" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fx0OtAeytxU/TcRS2X0_85I/AAAAAAAAAMw/OOpy0oylaYs/s640/a2d39b4085899e08_large.jpeg" width="640" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Miller went on to have an incredibly successful run in the business. He had dozens of hits, won several Grammy awards, had his own NBC television show, and eventually became a Tony award-winning composer for Broadway plays. After he died in 1992, he was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. That much of the story is well known to Miller's fans. Hopefully this release will shed some much-needed light on the early days and the lean years of one of the most brilliant men in the country music business, Roger Miller.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px;

Somehow I survived riding with teenage drunk drivers in high school, jealous men bent on revenge killing, and even playing on a cruise ship to Mexico with Kid Rock and 2600 deranged Kid Rock fans.&nbsp; The closest I?ve ever come to the precipice of eternal sleep, however, involved a chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; Thank god I?m alive to tell this story, otherwise I would have undoubtedly wound up as a third paragraph in ?News Of The Weird,? people chuckling about my colorful demise.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

One thing that really means a lot to me is how supportive and nice that people can be, often times complete strangers met on rainy roads in the middle of the night.&nbsp; These ?patrons of the arts? make up the gap between a very depressing existence and a satisfying life.&nbsp; Whether it is in the form of laundry, free dinner, shelter, vehicle repair, or the like, people help musicians out of the goodness of their hearts.&nbsp; With that in mind, please note that I do not wish to sound ungrateful in the telling of this story, nor do I wish to place the blame on anybody for what happened.&nbsp; The villain and the clown in this story without a hero are both one and the same, and they both camp out, like squatters, inside the empty warehouse between my ears.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">This story begins when some very nice fans made ?care packages? for the band after a show.&nbsp; These were little gift bags for each member of the group, with crackers, cookies, raisins, bananas, and nuts.&nbsp; We were grateful, fawned over them as you?re supposed to do to show our appreciation.&nbsp; The care packages went into the van, shoved into our own little found cubbyholes for gradual consumption.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Perhaps the most difficult part of being on the road for myself has been living with Type One diabetes.&nbsp; When you?re a diabetic under the best circumstances, it?s difficult to control your blood sugars and eat right.&nbsp; When you?re in a touring band, you find yourself eating at odd times of the day or night, stranded in places where fried corn nuggets pass as a vegetable.&nbsp; Even with the best of intentions and effort, I always find myself fluctuating between periods of really high blood sugars, which make you lethargic and exhausted, and really low blood sugars, which make you shaky and weak.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">I wish that the tale of my closest brush with death involved swashbuckling on the high seas, motorcycle stunt jumping, rescuing a baby from a burning building, or the martial arts.&nbsp; It does not.&nbsp; My near-death incident involves a chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; In my mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">My band and I were scheduled to play a record store ?in-store? appearance in Atlanta, and it was looking to be a great show.&nbsp; Record store appearances can be a great boost to your following, or they can be depressing reminders of your obscurity (insert <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv5FwzRBc_Y">Spinal Tap</a> reference here).&nbsp; This record store had done their promotion, as had some local friends and fans, so the place was packed in anticipation of our appearance.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">As is my preference, I was out in the parking lot getting changed in the van.&nbsp; Many times, people have asked me why I prefer getting changed in the van to other options like a dressing room or a bathroom.&nbsp; The answer is simple?I have left too many pairs of jeans and shoes behind in dressing rooms, because I am a forgetful moron.&nbsp; I have my routine, and it works for me.&nbsp; No need to feel sorry for me?in my van I am a king.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">There I was in the van, stripped down to my boxer shorts.&nbsp; A crowd of people and my band members waited for me to stroll in the front door, looking confident as a cool breeze, ready to rock the house.&nbsp; There was nothing but a dress shirt, a pair of pants and some brand new slick Stacy Adams dress <a href="http://www.stacyadams.com/shop/style/00017.html">shoes</a> between victory and myself.&nbsp; Then, I felt a low blood sugar incident coming on.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Diabetics will know exactly what I?m talking about, but for the rest of you, when you feel a low blood sugar crash coming over your body, you know that you have to eat something right then and there to prevent looking like a drooling and shaking object of pity fifteen minutes later.&nbsp; There?s also a chance of passing out, or going into a seizure.&nbsp; It?s serious stuff.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">A quick visual check through our bug-splattered windshield told me there was nothing in a one-block radius where I could buy anything to eat.&nbsp; A mental checklist reminded me that somewhere in the van was the ?care package? handed to me several days earlier.&nbsp; In that care package was a chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; A chocolate chip cookie?that would do the trick.&nbsp; That would get me over the hump.&nbsp; I was shaking, but I would be fine.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Rummaging around the floor of the van, I found my care package, where it had been seared by floor-of-van heat in the several thousand miles we had covered since the care packages were handed to us.&nbsp; Anybody who has ever crossed the country in a van knows about floor heat.&nbsp; You do anything to keep your feet off the floor?lie on the bench seats, put your feet up on the dash.&nbsp; A fool who keeps his feet on the hot van floor during a tour winds up with wicked athlete?s foot, and never does it again.&nbsp; The heat is like a griddle, and when I got to my little care package, the bag was hot to the touch.&nbsp; Inside the bag was the chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; I noticed right away that it didn?t look fresh.&nbsp; In fact, it looked terrible, the way that worms look on the sidewalk after a heavy rain, when they realize they?re dried up and they?re not going to make it to the other side of the sidewalk.&nbsp; Whatever it looked like, that chocolate chip cookie was going to have to get me out of my low blood sugar situation.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">I unwrapped the Saran Wrap and put the whole cookie in my mouth as I began trying to wrestle on my dress pants.&nbsp; This cookie is dry, I thought.&nbsp; Every bit of previously delicious Toll House moisture had been soaked out of the cookie from the hot drive and the days since it had been made.&nbsp; I kept working on it, trying to soften that sonofabitch up with my saliva.&nbsp; It was hopeless.&nbsp; This cookie was like a chunk of the Saraha Desert in baked goods form, a black hole of anti-matter vacuum-pressed into a deadly edible.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Somewhere in between the attempts to soften the damn cookie and chew the thing, I took a breath.&nbsp; Fine particles of cookie dust flew into my windpipe and lungs.&nbsp; Within a space of one second, the effort to get the cookie in my mouth instantly became an effort to get the cookie out of my lungs so that I would not die.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Suddenly, as they say, my life flashed before my eyes.&nbsp; I was dying.&nbsp; I was going to choke on a goddamn chocolate chip cookie outside a record store in Atlanta.&nbsp; My ignoble death was going to be the sole reason I was ever remembered.&nbsp; People would howl with laughter.&nbsp; Even those who loved me would agree: what a way to go!&nbsp; Beads of sweat rolled down my forehead.&nbsp; This was not good.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XdrMLKJHg0s/TbhpIquHPiI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/OYaRy4wkDKo/s1600/bon_scott.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Roll legends who choked to death on their own vomit.&nbsp; Even that had a sense of rock and roll flair to it, a departure that mirrored the life of drugged excess those stars led in their brief times.&nbsp; I saw a vision of cool looking rockers hanging out at Jim Morrison?s grave in Paris, then I saw my fated flat slab marker in a budget boneyard, with some fan?s lacquered chocolate chip cookie on my headstone, mocking me in tribute.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Only a few of the bios mention in passing that he had made a few failed records early on under the guise of Donny Young, and even then only in the shortest words possible, as if this was an unpleasant factoid to be swept under the rug and forgotten.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">What these historians seem to forget is that Paycheck (who, despite his numerous pseudonyms, shall be referred to henceforth as Paycheck, even when referencing his earlier self) had spent years making a slew of brilliant honky-tonk, near-rockabilly, and stone country records, some of the best records he would ever make, under that forgotten nom de plume of Donny Young.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The fact that these records did not sell--truthfully, that they could not even be given away--fails to diminish the excitement that they offer when heard with fresh ears some forty-five years down the road. They are great records, great songs, and great productions.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Nashville, then as now, only recognizes financial success, and these records were flops, therefore they must have been terrible records, according to the Nashville standard. Nobody bought Cadillacs from these discs, and the name Donny Young draws a blank stare from all but the most astute music historians. However, their failure was more likely due to the uncontrollable, ornery, drugging and drinking nature of the young man who sang them, and to the lack of promotion on the part of the record labels, than to any lack of musical greatness. The greatness was there, fully intact; it would just take a name change, a smart manager, and the advent of Outlaw Country before the Cadillacs would come, and the respect of the country music establishment with them.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Donald Eugene Lytle was born May 31, 1938, in Greenfield, Ohio, an unlikely place for a future country star to hail from, but not entirely out of character. Outside of Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, Ohio was one hick town after another, and country music had always been king. The great radio powerhouse WLW broadcast out of Cincinnati, bringing the sounds of country music to towns like Greenfield, and of course WSM and the Grand Ole Opry were well within broadcast range.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The giant record label King was based out of Cincinnati, releasing hundreds of budget country albums, and the Jimmie Skinner Record Shop, also based out of Cincy, distributed millions of those country discs to rural areas such as Greenfield and every other little town in a thousand-mile radius.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">When asked about his early years, Paycheck remembered his mother having Hank Williams 78 RPM records in their house and reckoned that Hank was his biggest influence. His mother gave the lad a guitar at the age of six and began entering him in talent contests in the nearby area when he was nine. By thirteen he was working steadily as a professional singer at Paul Angel's Club 28 in Greenfield.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Not content with local stability, Paycheck began drifting early on, hopping a freight train at the age of fifteen and traveling to all the cities in the tri-state area. Wherever he would land, he would get a job as a singer at a local honky-tonk, and he worked at many of the top country nightclubs in Ohio before making the big decision to join the Navy.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It's hard to imagine anyone less suited for the rigors of military life than Johnny Paycheck, and sure enough within a few months he had been court-martialed and put in the brig for fracturing an officer's skull during a brawl. In 1956 he was sentenced to hard time for the offense and began serving it at a military prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">While in the brig, Paycheck attempted to escape so many times that eventually they reduced his sentence, and long before his release date they let him go out of sheer exasperation. After being freed, Paycheck drifted to Florida, Texas, and then finally decided to give it a go as a professional country music singer in Nashville.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">After arriving in Nashville, Paycheck was discovered by Buddy Killen, who gave him a job as a songwriter and demo singer for Tree Publishing (still a huge force in Nashville, but now called Sony/ATV Music Publishing). While it was a professional gig in the music business, it was the sort of job where one barely made enough money to rent a hot attic room at a boardinghouse.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paycheck caught a break, however, when the producer Owen Bradley, who also acted as an A&amp;R man for Decca Records, heard one of his demos and signed him to a recording contract, which must have seemed like a huge break for the struggling young singer. It was, but as it went for Buddy Holly with Decca a few years earlier, simply having releases on the label was no guarantee of success.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Producer Owen Bradley must have believed in the young singer, though, as four singles were released over the next three years, all excellent examples of hard-core honky-tonk and country.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The first release was "It's Been a Long, Long Time for Me" b/w "On This Mountain Top," released as Decca 9-30763 in November of 1958. The topside was written by Paycheck, a great bouncy number reminiscent of the hits Faron Young was having at the time. The flip featured Paycheck's "roaring" buddy <a href="http://www.rogermiller.com/">Roger Miller</a> on harmony vocals, and Miller was given a cobilling on the label. The record was superb on all accounts, with an impassioned vocal and the full A-team session-man treatment from Owen Bradley. This statement can be echoed time and time again throughout these notes, but it should have been a hit. It was a great record.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paycheck and Roger Miller were both destined for stardom, but in the studio at that moment in the fall of 1958 they were unknown, two very small fish in a very big pond. It would be years before either one would taste the glory of a hit record. By any standard it was an auspicious debut, but for all intents and purposes, the careers of both men began that night--the start of a long, hard slog for both of them.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The second record, "The Old Man and the River" b/w "Pictures Can't Talk," released as Decca 9-30881 in April of 1959, was yet another two-side artistic success that garnered no sales. Roger Miller's tune on the topside (he was also writing song demos for Tree Music at the same time) was a great Cajun-flavored song with a memorable chorus, and Paycheck's flip was a first-rate weeper that suited his wounded enunciation perfectly.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">By this point Paycheck must have been tasting the bitter pill of realization, just as Buddy Holly had a few years earlier: that good product didn't automatically translate into hit records and those elusive Cadillacs.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">By the time of the third release, "Shakin' the Blues" b/w "Miracle of Love," Paycheck really hit his stride. This record can only be considered a masterpiece in every respect: songwriting (it was written by none other than Paycheck's boss at this point, George Jones), arrangement, performance, and production. It was a record that had "HIT" written all over it, and yet again it failed to chart.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vdrEk5cRvAs/TZlC_39vatI/AAAAAAAAAL8/yG4yLL5vBz8/s1600/DonnyYoungDECCA.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="628" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vdrEk5cRvAs/TZlC_39vatI/AAAAAAAAAL8/yG4yLL5vBz8/s640/DonnyYoungDECCA.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">While "Shakin' the Blues" has seen release on numerous rockabilly compilations, the truth is that it was just hard-driving honky-tonk with a beat. The twin fiddles and steel guitar could have made it a Ray Price session, but Paycheck's frantic vocal separates into something else entirely, something entirely his own. The mold for the later Paycheck hits was cast with this record--edgy, unpredictable, and raw--which certainly would make him a good candidate for rockabilly but actually foreshadowed the Outlaw Country movement that would come some years later.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Ignored by the public and critics alike, as time went on gradually people became aware of "Shakin' the Blues," and now some forty-five years after its release, many collectors and country music aficionados now consider it one of the best records cut in Nashville during the golden era of the late 1950s "Nashville Sound."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The failure of "Shakin' the Blues" must have soured Decca on the marketability of Donny Young, and he was allowed to record no more sessions at Bradley's studio. One more 45 was released in July of 1961, "I Guess I Had It Coming" b/w "Go Ring the Bells" (Decca 9-31283), which was made up of two leftovers from the earlier sessions. The topside was written by Paycheck and dated from the first session in 1958, featuring Roger Miller on harmony vocals once again, though he was not credited on this release. The flip was a ballad by Don Gibson, who was hot as a pistol at the time, but it didn't seem to help Donny Young one bit. Although both were again great songs with a lot going for them, this release seems to have been an afterthought, with no promotion put behind it whatsoever. Decca dropped Paycheck soon thereafter, and he moved back to Ohio.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Collectors rejoice: One unreleased song from the Decca period, "Story Behind the Photograph," has surfaced and is included here for the first time. Also, it should be noted that several Paycheck discographies list a record credited to Jimmy Dallas, "Hurtin' in My Heart" b/w "My Kind of Love" (Decca 9-31133), as actually being Paycheck singing under a pseudonym. This simply isn't the case. Jimmy Dallas was a fairly established country singer from Kansas City who had been making records since the early 1950s, and this Decca release bears no resemblance to Paycheck's style whatsoever, making its inclusion on several Paycheck discographies all the more baffling.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">While licking his wounds back in Ohio, Paycheck had the fortune to hook up with a like-minded young singer named <a href="http://www.darrellmccallcountry.com/">Darrell McCall</a>, who was also an Ohio native with a love for hard-core country music. The pair started singing together and discovered that their vocal harmonies meshed perfectly. Soon Paycheck was plotting his return to Nashville, this time as part of a duo, which he christened the Young Brothers (and, indeed, Darrell McCall would be known as Darrell Young around Nashville for a number of years).</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">As McCall recounts, the pair hit Nashville with something less than a splash, with literally pennies between them. The first night in town, they slept underneath the Main Street bridge before getting a room at Mom Upchurch's boardinghouse, which served as a headquarters for broke musicians looking for work. Roger Miller also lived there, and Paycheck relished being reunited with his old buddy. Between Paycheck, McCall, and Miller, they began setting a standard for rowdy behavior that is the benchmark for country musicians to this day.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Darrell McCall blames most of this on their copious use of uppers, a common party favor during the 1960s. To quote McCall, "You had to take uppers back then, just to keep up with the grueling pace. We started out with what they called Ol' Yellers, which weren't too bad for you, as they had vitamins and nutrients inside. Then we got into White Crosses, Black Mollys, Yellowjackets, and Speckled Birds, which were harsher and harsher forms of speed as time went along. By the time we got around to Speckled Birds, things were getting pretty nuts."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">During Paycheck's tenure with Decca Records, he had been hiring himself out as a sideman to help pay the bills. In fact there hadn't been much promotion of Donny Young the solo artist to speak of, save for one aborted tour with Roger Miller and Bill Anderson that had ended with Miller having to pawn his newly purchased portable record player (which he had bought so the trio could listen to their own records while on the road) for gas money home. Paycheck had a reputation as a good bass player and high harmony singer, and he filled that role with Porter Waggoner, Faron Young, Ray Price, and, most notably, George Jones over the next few years.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Darrell McCall remembers that Ray Price had a custom suit made originally for Paycheck, and that due to Paycheck's volatility, both he and Willie Nelson were called on at various times to play bass for Ray Price, simply because they both fit into Paycheck's suit--something that didn't sit too well with McCall due to both Paycheck's and Willie Nelson's extreme body odor!</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Faron Young took Paycheck, Roger Miller, and Darrell McCall out as sidemen at various times during this period. Paycheck's yearlong stint with Young proved to be one of his longest uninterrupted road gigs.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Of all of his sideman jobs, it is probably Paycheck's tenure with George Jones that is best remembered. Jones and Paycheck had a long history over a period dating roughly 1959-66: an on-again, off-again relationship that was as stormy as it was productive.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">According to Darrell McCall, Paycheck had a nasty habit of getting drunk and fighting with his employers, and George Jones was no pushover himself. Both men were short in height and short in temper. The explosive relationship between the two was tempered by the fact that both men dearly loved each other and would always forgive and forget, only to repeat the exact same scenario the next time around.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Notably, music historians have pointed out that George Jones seemed to absorb Johnny Paycheck's vocal styling during this time frame, a fact Jones has not exactly denied. Many of the inflections, dips to the low registers following by soaring high notes, and other examples of the classic George Jones style seem to have come directly from working with Paycheck during those years. The proof does lie in the chronology of the recordings: Jones's Starday and Mercury output before working with Paycheck demonstrates a completely different mode of singing that is more rooted in the traditional Hank Williams style than anything else. However, once Donny Young (aka Johnny Paycheck) began singing harmonies with Jones, the style so associated with Jones in later years began to take shape. Paycheck, to his credit, only intimated that both men influenced each other during the time they worked together.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: Donny Young aka Johnny Paycheck, playing bass and sharing the microphone with George Jones.</span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jRrpXImNJdM/TcRLgHV_UZI/AAAAAAAAAMk/J8iiFiQXayA/s1600/JohnnyPaycheckGeorgeJones.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jRrpXImNJdM/TcRLgHV_UZI/AAAAAAAAAMk/J8iiFiQXayA/s640/JohnnyPaycheckGeorgeJones.jpg" width="636" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">In fact it was Jones that got Paycheck his next recording contract, with his own label, Mercury Records.

Continuing to work as a sideman paid the bills, but there were often months where there was no work, and the frustration must have been maddening.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">One way to keep a finger in the business and earn some money on the side was by cutting scab, or nonunion, sessions for budget labels around Nashville. During the period of 1960-61 Paycheck, along with Darrell McCall and Roger Miller, would make many soundalike scab recordings for Starday. These were covers of the top hits of the day, which were then sold at a budget price to people who often didn't realize they were being duped by singers attempting to re-create the sound of the original hits.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Darrell McCall recalls that these sessions paid ten dollars each. That must have been demeaning, especially to such talented young men, but it was one way to keep food on the table and get experience in the studio as well.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paycheck had several of his songs released on a series of Dixie EPs (Dixie was a Starday imprint) with no artist credit, and at least one track released on a budget Starday album was credited to Donny Young. All the tracks he recorded during this time are included here, some making their debut after having remained in the can for forty years.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">While these are by no means the best recordings Paycheck ever cut, they are fascinating examples of low-budget early-1960s country music. Paycheck does attempt to sound like the singers he's covering, but his own personality can't be helped, and they sound more like what an actual Johnny Paycheck live show must have sounded like than anything else. Darrell McCall and Roger Miller (as well as George McCormick) can be heard singing vocal harmonies on these tracks, and Paycheck can in turn be heard singing harmonies for songs credited to both McCall and Miller, recorded at these same scab sessions.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It was at the 1962 Nashville Dee-Jay convention that Eddie Crandall, a music hustler associated with Marty Robbins, played a demo tape of songs for the New York-based A&amp;R man Aubrey Mayhew, who worked for Pickwick Records. Although Crandall was attempting to sell the songs on the tape, Mayhew paid Crandall $200 just to know who it was singing on the demos.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Reportedly, Crandall then led Mayhew to the aforementioned Main Street bridge, under which Paycheck was sleeping one off (Mom Upchurch's boardinghouse locked its doors at midnight). Mayhew began managing the singer, at least as well as anyone could manage him, and spent the next couple of years developing him. According to Mayhew, Paycheck was supposed to keep a low profile and write songs, preparing for their big push, but the stipend Mayhew provided actually translated into pouring a lot of money into an endless black hole of parties and pills.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paycheck ventured westward and spent most of 1962 and 1963 in both Southern California and Las Vegas. In Vegas he worked for <a href="http://www.wynnstewart.com/">Wynn Stewart</a>, who ran the house band at the Nashville Nevada Club. Wynn's bass player at the time was none other than <a href="http://merlehaggard.com/">Merle Haggard</a>, and Haggard hit it off with Paycheck right away--another pairing of two rowdy souls schooled in the art of "roaring."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paycheck loved the West Coast and its country music scene and was a big fan of Buck Owens in particular. According to Darrell McCall, Owens had Paycheck to thank for finally getting him played on the radio in Nashville, which had shut him out up to that point due to his outsider status. Paycheck spent many sleepless nights staying up with Ralph Emery at WSM, and he persuaded Emery to play one of Owens's discs, which helped break Owens into the Nashville establishment. Later on, after being christened Johnny Paycheck, he would cover an obscure Buck Owens album track, "A-11," and turn it into his first breakout hit.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Exactly how Paycheck's last release under the name Donny Young came about is unknown. The Todd label was the brainchild of the Decca A&amp;R man Paul Cohen, who had run it as a sideline business since 1957, releasing everything from rockabilly (Jericho Jones) to surf (Bobby Fuller) and all styles in between. Presumably Paycheck still had some contact with Paul Cohen from the Decca days, or perhaps it was a deal brokered by Aubrey Mayhew, but either way it was a great record that never had a chance.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"Don't You Get Lonesome" b/w "I'm Glad to Have Her Back Again" was released as Todd 1098 in early 1964.

They closely resemble the type of songs that Paycheck would soon become known for on Hilltop and Little Darlin'. Gino King, who played guitar with Little Jimmy Dickens for many years, remembers playing guitar and singing harmony on the Todd disc, but beyond that all session details are unknown.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Another collectors' note: Several discographies list a Donny Young single on American-Canadian (AmCan) as being another Paycheck disc.

As it turned out, Mayhew rechristened Donny Young as Johnny Paycheck after an obscure prizefighter, and he even formed a new Pickwick subsidiary, which he named Hilltop, specifically to release Johnny Paycheck records.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The timing was right this time around.

By the time of his next resurrection in the early 1970s with producer Billy Sherrill, Paycheck was poised for superstardom with such megahits as "She's All I Got" in 1971, and of course his 1977 anthem "Take This Job and Shove It," the song that would forevermore define him.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xh2ssKocbl4/TZlGBh2P8NI/AAAAAAAAAME/jYjaFcEvXPE/s1600/JohnnyPaycheck.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xh2ssKocbl4/TZlGBh2P8NI/AAAAAAAAAME/jYjaFcEvXPE/s640/JohnnyPaycheck.jpg" width="632" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It was an astounding nineteen years between the day Paycheck first entered a recording studio and his first number-one hit. It's likely that few of the bikers, truckers, and long-haired rebels buying the Paycheck records of the late '70s knew that the gravelly-voiced survivor dated back to a completely different era, when he was a skinny, pompadoured young man with a soaring, high voice, trying to make a name for himself with a name that no one would ever remember: the forgotten alias of Donny Young.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 1px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 1px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Postscript: Johnny Paycheck died on February 19, 2003, from emphysema and asthma.

Jim Cooprider is always there, carrying his trusty wooden record box, lacquered with rare record labels on the side.<br /><br />The first few times I saw Jim Cooprider, I have to confess, I thought he must be completely insane. He wasn?t much for socializing with other collectors, at least while he was scouting for records. In fact he is usually found not auditioning records on a player, but instead doing something odd with them, like holding it up to an inch in front of his face, or holding it up to his ear while thumping it with his fingers. More often than not, he would talk to himself, saying things in a mysterious code that only a precious few could decipher:<br /><br />?This is a Camden, New Jersey pressing.?<br /><br />?This is the 1933 reissue, not the 1927 original.?<br /><br />?Hairline crack?. looks fixable.?<br /><br />Such uninvited utterances will scare off the timid. More than once I saw a visiting Japanese collector scouring Northern Soul 45?s back away from Jim as he muttered to himself, fearing that he must be one of those crazy Americans they?ve read about.<br /><br />It wasn?t until I met Jim?s daughter Yvonne that I got to know him a little better. Once I got to know him, and understand where he?s coming from, I realized that Jim Cooprider understands records the way that lifelong farmers understand weather and soil conditions, or the way that an experienced surgeon realizes the interplay between all the body?s delicate internal systems. In short, I?ve never met a man who was in tune with the physical, emotional, and spiritual properties of records like Jim Cooprider.<br /><br />When I say records, I mean records. A visit to Jim Cooprider?s house will find records of all kinds?33, 45, 78, and undoubtedly </span>       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unusual_types_of_gramophone_records"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">16 and 80 rpm oddities</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">, piled in every corner of every nook and cranny in the residence. That was how I eventually became friends with Jim Cooprider?for if you let him know that you love records too, you?ve made a friend for life.<br /><br />Most of us record collectors, even the nerdiest ones among us, focus on the music contained in the grooves, and the condition of the record?for instance, if the scratches on the record impair the pleasure of listening to the musical performance contained within. Jim Cooprider loves music, don?t doubt that for a second (he is happy to espouse the virtues of 20?s jazz, or 50?s doo-wop, or obscure rockabilly gems), but Jim is the only person I?ve ever met who goes far beyond those simple boundaries.<br /><br />Jim has handled so many records in his life that he can immediately tell what kind of pressing it is, and usually what pressing plant produced it, and whether or not the disc can be repaired if broken, warped or scratched. Amateurs such as myself know records to be made of different materials (vinyl for LP?s and 45?s, styrene for budget 45?s, shellac for 78?s), but Jim can reveal things about a record that few would realize or understand.<br /><br />In this sense, Jim is the ?Record Whisperer,? one of my favorite titles for him. Innately, he understands the physical properties of a record as if it were an external manifestation of one of his own vital organs.<br /><br />Early on, I learned that Jim was famous for his offer to un-warp any record for a dollar. Dealers would bring in stacks of valuable records that had edge warps, dish warps, storage warps, and Jim would tell them just by looking at the disc what sort of result he would be able to achieve.<br /><br />Later, when I was able to go to his home, I got to view this process firsthand, which was as astonishing as any demonstration I?ve ever witnessed. Jim has a method, perfected over decades, of fixing warped records that involves heating in his home oven to a particular temperature, removing the disc from the oven, placing it on a flat piece of heavy glass, and doing a form of rain dance around the disc, bouncing the floor just enough to make the pliable heated record slowly settle to flattened, un-warped perfection.<br /><br />I?ve taken records to Jim that friends of mine deemed unrepairable. It doesn?t matter to Jim if the disc is a golden oldie from the thrift store, or a thousand dollar rockabilly record, if he can fix it, he?ll fix it for a buck.<br /><br />One of the other tricks in Jim?s trick bag is his method of fixing broken or cracked records. Generally, if a record is broken in two it can?t be repaired to be unnoticeable, but rare discs can be repaired with a number of different chemical compounds on the edges, to get the record fused back together enough to be playable once again. I remember Jim rattling off a list of the chemicals that he uses to fuse records back together again (Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone, or </span>       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butanone"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">MEK</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">, was one of them?in fact ?MEK? is one of the things Jim will often talk about in front of unsuspecting passers-by), all of which exhibited a certain chemical property relating to the particular chemical compound of the record itself.<br /><br />In addition to his wizardly ways of working with records, Jim also likes to disc jockey wherever he is welcome. One of my favorite memories of Jim was seeing him DJ using 78-rpm records exclusively at a local venue featuring swing music. Of course, the selections Jim brought were all completely appropriate for the evening, and seeing them played on a 78 player with the CD jukebox in the background was a delightful juxtaposition of images.<br /><br />The man has been collecting records for so long, that he?s able to expound on virtually any subject, so long as it relates to records. Unlike most of the ?record snobs? I know, Jim is happy to talk about anything from banjo records to classical collections to rock and roll, all with his particular slant on why a certain release was better, be it the performance, mastering, pressing, or packaging.<br /><br />One of the other things I dearly love about Jim is that while he does pay differing amounts for records, and has sold records that are valuable, one thing you?ll never hear Jim Cooprider go on about is a record?s collectible value. For myself, it?s a breath of fresh air, having been bored to tears listening to collectors talk about how much their collection is worth. For Jim, it truly is about the love of records.<br /><br />With a house full of records, and decades of collecting behind him, it?s easy to wonder why Jim Cooprider still shows up early at the record swap meet. Does he need any more records? The answer is unequivocally no. It?s obviously an addiction, and an obsession that most of us reading this magazine share. However, none of us compare in sheer exhaustive record collecting extremism the way that Jim Cooprider does as a way of life. I love that about the guy. Sometimes, when I?m feeling too lazy to get up for the PCC Swap Meet, I think to myself?Jim?s out there, I need to get up out of bed. If I ever feel a twitch of reality and start thinking I have enough records, I think about Jim and I realize?you can never, ever have too many records.<br /><br />Jim Cooprider is really one of the great American characters that make this country so damn interesting. The next time you see him at the swap meet awkwardly holding records right up to his eye, remember?there?s an Albert Einstein level of genius at work there. There are secrets he knows that you and I will never know.<br /><br />As generations go by, there seems to be less and less importance on collecting. I remember growing up in the 1970?s that every block had a group of obsessed collectors?the guy who collected vintage model trains, </span>      <a href="http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/an-interview-with-antique-glass-insulator-collector-ian-macky/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">the guy who collected glass telephone pole insulators</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">, and the guy who collected old records. I loved those guys, and their passion, and the level of interest in things that most would find mundane. I wanted to be like them (and I guess I am).<br /><br />Things like the mp3 player and the recordable CD have changed all that. Kids today seem unimpressed by a wall of vinyl, showing that their Ipod contains more songs on it than thousands of heavy record albums. Kids today also seem to have an attention span that is so short, they can?t be bothered to play individual records such as 45 or 78 singles?it?s too much trouble.<br /><br />As such, we may see these intrinsic American characters like Jim Cooprider eventually disappear from the landscape of America. I, for one, will rue that day. Our world is richer for having them. Jim Cooprider is our ?record whisperer,? and we should all thank him for it.<br /><br />Deke Dickerson</span>   </span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Below: Jim Cooprider, the Record Whisperer.</span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WfVgWYQq7qE/TcRKyAqA_II/AAAAAAAAAMg/nfrl3yVCHfA/s1600/Jim+Cooprider+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WfVgWYQq7qE/TcRKyAqA_II/AAAAAAAAAMg/nfrl3yVCHfA/s640/Jim+Cooprider+2.jpg" width="488" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span>";s:12:"link_replies";s:148:"http://muleskinner.blogspot.com/feeds/4764435520318160397/comments/defaulthttp://muleskinner.blogspot.com/2011/04/record-whisperer.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/804177363231555459/posts/default/4764435520318160397";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/804177363231555459/posts/default/4764435520318160397";s:4:"link";s:61:"http://muleskinner.blogspot.com/2011/04/record-whisperer.html";s:11:"author_name";s:14:"Deke Dickerson";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/05102841468714254860";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:16;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-804177363231555459.post-4929277355637042743";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-12-09T23:46:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2010-12-09T23:46:26.487-08:00";s:5:"title";s:30:"From Vintage Guitar magazine--";s:12:"atom_content";s:49390:"<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">TINY MOORE?S 1952&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">BIGSBY MANDOLIN</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAI1sFMWJQs/TQFECi-GG1I/AAAAAAAAAKg/Bxf1aor57Vc/s1600/BigsbyTinyMoore.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAI1sFMWJQs/TQFECi-GG1I/AAAAAAAAAKg/Bxf1aor57Vc/s1600/BigsbyTinyMoore.JPG" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><o:p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">This author recently contributed?in the form of research, photography, and detective work?to the newly released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Paul-Bigsby-Electric-Solidbody/dp/0615243045/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291928693&amp;sr=8-4">book</a> ?The Story of Paul Bigsby?Father Of The Modern Solidbody Electric Guitar?

Bob Wills, lead vocalist Tommy Duncan, and Bob?s brother Billy Jack Wills were in the restaurant eating sandwiches after a performance at Beaumont?s Pleasure Pier, and Tiny wanted to meet them.&nbsp; Tiny struck up a conversation with Wills, and it wasn?t long before Wills asked him to get his mandolin from his car and play a little for them.&nbsp; Tiny was hired on the spot, got on the tour bus the next morning and became a featured member of Bob Wills?

The late 1930?s incarnation of the band was a large orchestra with brass and woodwind sections, however after losing most of his players to the draft in World War Two, Wills restructured the Playboys after the war to be a smaller, electrified combo with the emphasis on hot string players.&nbsp; The late 1940?s lineups of the Texas Playboys included incredible musicians like <a href="http://www.texasplayboys.net/Biographies/junior.htm">Junior Barnard</a> on bluesy, distorted electric guitar; <a href="http://www.remingtonsteelguitars.com/about.html">Herb Remington</a> playing incredibly adventurous steel guitar, and fellow Texan Johnny Gimble on fiddle and mandolin.&nbsp; Together with Tiny?s hot electric mandolin, the group worked up incredible two, three, and four-part harmony leads that Western Swing scholars are still trying to pick apart today.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: Bob Wills and Tiny Moore.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Vance Terry, wanting an instrument like other top steel players like Joaquin Murphey, Speedy West, and Noel Boggs, ordered a custom-made Bigsby triple-neck steel guitar in 1951.&nbsp; A Bigsby steel guitar was something only the top professionals could afford at the time, as Paul Bigsby built each instrument by hand, with a waiting list a year long to buy his instruments.&nbsp;

Tiny Moore followed Vance Terry?s example and went to visit Paul Bigsby.&nbsp; Tiny ordered a Bigsby electric mandolin for himself, to replace and update his ten-year-old Gibson EM-150.&nbsp; While Tiny has erroneously been credited with receiving the first solidbody electric mandolin, the truth is that Bigsby made his first electric mandolin (unless an earlier example surfaces) for Paul Buskirk in 1950, which was a ten-string mandolin strung in 5 courses (not to mention the fact that Bigsby instruments made after early 1949 aren?t true ?solidbodies,? they are neck-through-body instruments with hollow wings).&nbsp; Bigsby also made several other mandolins around the same time, including electric mandolins for Eschol Cosby and Al Giddings, and a re-necked Kay acoustic mandolin for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nudie-Rodeo-Tailor-Original-Rhinestone/dp/1586853813">Nudie Cohn the ?Rodeo Tailor</a>,? among others.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A short time later Scotty Broyles went into the Navy and found himself stationed in San Diego at the Naval Base on North Island.&nbsp; San Diego had a tremendous country music and western swing scene in the early 50?s, centered at the Bostonia Ballroom east of San Diego in El Cajon.&nbsp; Here Scotty saw just about every top country music star of the day in person, and took color slide photographs whenever he could (in fact, several of Scotty?s beautiful color slides were included in the Bigsby book, including the only known color photograph of Merle Travis holding his 1948 Bigsby electric guitar).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scotty befriended another country music fan on the Naval base, a musician and amateur guitar builder named Jim Harvey.&nbsp; Beginning around 1951, Jim Harvey built guitars, steel guitars, and mandolins in his La Jolla garage workshop, all showing a heavy Bigsby influence?neck-through-body construction, birdseye maple bodies with natural finish, aluminum nuts and bridges, etc.&nbsp; Soon Harvey agreed to build Scotty a 5-string electric mandolin, based on the Buskirk 10-string idea but with 5 single strings.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Harvey?s earliest creations had DeArmond floating pickups, as they were the only commercially available pickup at that time (it might be hard to imagine, but 60 years ago guitar manufacturers wouldn?t sell their pickups or parts as separate accessory items).&nbsp; Jim Harvey was aware of Paul Bigsby?s pickups, and he decided to drive up to Downey to meet Bigsby in person and ask to purchase pickups for use on his own Jim Harvey instruments.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scotty Broyles tells the story: ?Jim asked Paul if he would sell him a pickup, and Paul said he?d have to see his work, and if it was good enough, he might consider it.&nbsp; Jim went out to his car and got the guitar he was working on, and Bigsby spent about ten minutes slowly looking it over.&nbsp; Finally, without saying anything, Paul walked over to a cabinet mounted on the wall, pulls out a pickup, comes back over to Jim and tells him the pickups are fifty dollars, and they?re the same price if he takes the pickup by itself or leaves the instrument to have him install it.?<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Harvey would go on to make a dozen or so instruments, about half of which used Bigsby pickups, including Scotty?s electric five-string mandolin.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Scotty recalls how Tiny Moore became associated with the five-string electric mandolin: ?Jim Harvey had taken my unfinished mandolin up there to Paul Bigsby to have a five-string pickup installed.&nbsp; Well, it was sitting around Bigsby?s shop for a few weeks while he installed the pickup, and about that time, Tiny Moore came and visited Bigsby to see how his new electric mandolin was coming.&nbsp; Tiny had ordered a four-string mandolin, but when he saw my Harvey five-string mandolin lying there, he changed his mind and told Paul right then and there his had to be a five-string too.&nbsp; Paul was mad, because he was just about done with Tiny?s instrument!&nbsp; Eventually Tiny got his way, and that?s the reason Tiny?s Bigsby had five strings instead of four, was because he saw mine in the shop.?</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;

Tiny Moore?s Bigsby, although now weathered and showing the signs of decades of hard work on the road, is a magnificent example of Paul Bigsby?s work.&nbsp; One of the hallmarks of Bigsby instruments is the graceful slope where the neck joins the body.&nbsp; All genuine Bigsbys have this slope that seamlessly fades the back of the neck into the neck/body joint (and it?s easy to spot a forgery when they lack this feature), and the one on Tiny Moore?s mandolin is perhaps the most graceful example of the neck-to-body fade this author has ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Tiny?s instrument has a couple of unique features, despite the fact that all Bigsby instruments are unique.&nbsp; A feature not found on any other Bigsby instrument is the master volume control located above the bridge, with the tone control by the pickup switch, suited to Tiny?s ergonomic preference.&nbsp; The bridge saddle is straight across at a slight angle, which all of Bigsby?s mandolins and the upper mandolin neck of Grady Martin?s doubleneck guitar have in common, unlike the typical compensated Bigsby bridge saddle found on the larger instruments.&nbsp; The mandolin?s top and back are made of figured curly maple, unlike the birdseye maple used on most, but not all, Bigsby instruments.&nbsp; The mandolin utilizes the standard mandolin scale length of 13 7/8?.&nbsp; With its neck-through-body design (with hollow wings) style of construction, the instrument is also light as a feather, as most Bigsbys are.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Tiny played both mandolin and fiddle, and did so well with Merle?s band (?The Strangers?) that he became a regular member of the touring and recording band.&nbsp; Tiny would continue to play with Merle Haggard on and off throughout the 1970?s and 1980?s, eventually ending the Haggard gig when Merle insisted his entire band relocate to the Redding, California, area?Tiny declared he was staying in Sacramento and handed in his resignation.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Below: Tiny's original Bigsby case still has the "Merle Haggard Road Show" sticker on it from his 1970's tours.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

When Paul purchased a National lap steel at a vintage guitar show in the early 1990?s, it had a signed receipt from Letritia Kandle?s guitar studio with a Chicago address, which told him that she was from the Chicago area, but Paul assumed that she must have passed away.&nbsp; More years went by, and finally in 2007 Paul met one of Letritia?s former students at a steel guitar convention in Illinois, who informed Paul that Mrs. Kandle was still alive and living in the Chicago suburbs!&nbsp; This person was able to put Paul in touch with Letritia, who had been quietly living her life under her married name since she gave up music in the 1950?s.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">When Paul finally got in touch with Letritia at her home, the real story began to unfold.&nbsp; Letritia?s story had been unfairly relegated to the dustbins of history.&nbsp; However, thanks to her incredible memory, and the amazing photos and press clippings of the era that survive, her story can now be told.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;Letritia Kandle was born in Chicago in November 7, 1915, the only child of Charles and Alma Kandle.&nbsp; In her early years, Letritia was a very typical young lady of the era.&nbsp; She took piano lessons, but when she was thirteen years old, she saw Warner Baxter play the Spanish guitar in the film ?The Cisco Kid.?&nbsp; This film made such an impression that immediately Letritia wanted to play the guitar instead of the piano.&nbsp; Her instructor advised her that the Hawaiian (also known as ?steel?) guitar was becoming popular, and helped Letritia get started on the acoustic Hawaiian guitar.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Letritia?s father was always supportive of his daughter?s efforts, and after demonstrating she was serious about the Hawaiian guitar, she had top-of-the-line instruments for her musical endeavors.&nbsp; Her early acoustic instruments included a Weissenborn Koa guitar, and a National Style 2 (and later, a top of the line Style 4) Resophonic Hawaiian guitar.&nbsp; When Letritia saw an old turn-of-the-century double-neck harp guitar (possibly made the by Chicago maker Almcrantz) hanging in a second-hand shop, she asked her father to buy it for her and help her convert it from a harp guitar to a Hawaiian raised-nut instrument with a standard neck and a 12-string neck capable of different tunings.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

There, Letritia met George Kealoha Gilman, who mentored her in Hawaiian lore?speaking the Hawaiian language, Hula dancing, and making leis and grass skirts.&nbsp; The following year, in 1934, Letritia formed an all-girl ensemble known as ?The Kohala Girls.?&nbsp; The Kohala Girls specialized in Hawaiian music, and had matching National Resophonic guitars.</span></span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAI1sFMWJQs/TPNXYM-u7bI/AAAAAAAAAJs/aMJ0UpfP-LA/s1600/LetritiaKohalaGirls.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

After a few years of playing with the Kohala Girls, during which time electric lap steels and double-neck lap steels began to come on the scene, Letritia had a vision for a brand new revolutionary instrument.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Letritia wrote the story herself of how the National ?Grand Letar? console steel guitar came to be, for a series of articles in ?Music Studio News.?&nbsp; Here, directly from the source, is how this incredible instrument came into being:<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">?Have you ever indulged in dreaming?&nbsp; If you have, you know that there are primarily two different kinds?one where the dreamer tries to escape from the reality of living, and one where the dreamer sets a mental goal for himself, and then tries by hard, honest endeavor to reach it in reality.&nbsp; The second type of dreamer is responsible for many of the advancements of our Modern way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">?And so while waiting for an appointment on one of the upper floors of a tall office building in Chicago, the idea for a 26 string guitar was born.&nbsp; It was summer and through the large window facing the West from where I was sitting, the sun, like a huge ball of fire, surrounded by a myriad of colors, sky blue, pink, yellow, purple, and green was dropping by the horizon, there appeared an instrument seemingly blown of glass.&nbsp; I kept looking at the sky, when the crisp friendly voice of the receptionist called my mind back to this world.&nbsp; In those few moments of daydreaming, I knew what I wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">?A guitar that would enable me to stand while playing it, one that would sound full, like an organ, and yet produce tones like a vibraharp?one with not less than 26 strings, for complete harmony, and one that would change colors as the different tones were produced.&nbsp; When I arrived home, later that evening, I told my father of the dream.&nbsp; Although my dad is an engineer and not a musician, he offered to help build the ?dream instrument? for me, if I would help.<o:p></o:p></span></span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">?The problems we encountered were many, each one had to be dealt with separately?a metal had to be chosen for the casting, that would not expand or contract when in contact with heat?sizes of strings, electronics, etc. until finally after many days, weeks, and months of labor, emerged a finished instrument.<o:p></o:p></span></span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">?Now that the instrument was finished a name for it had to be selected, so, from my first name, Letritia, we took the first three letters, and from the word guitar we chose the last two letters.&nbsp;

The instrument was a large console, with the top part of the steel guitar made of a poured aluminum casting.&nbsp; The sides and ?console? were made of wood and covered with a chrome-plated steel wrap.&nbsp; This was the first time that a steel guitar was not held in the lap, so it was a radical construction for the time.&nbsp; Additionally, no steel guitar had ever had more than two necks on it before this one.&nbsp; Letritia?s Grand Letar appeared to have four necks on it, three six-string necks and one eight string neck, but in reality it had three six-string necks and two four-string necks on it (more on that later).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Letritia?s father built the console of the steel guitar, then went to see Louis Dopyera at National Guitars.&nbsp; Letritia had been playing National Resophonics with The Kohala Girls, and already knew the Dopyera family at National.&nbsp; Mr. Kandle brought the basic body of the Grand Letar to National, where they installed pickups and an internal 20-watt National amplifier with two 12-inch Lansing (JBL) field coil speakers.&nbsp; This built-in amplifier happens to hold the distinction of being the first guitar amplifier to use two speakers?a full ten years before Leo Fender made the Dual Professional, and twenty-odd years before Leo began offering the Twin with JBL speakers as an option!&nbsp; Letritia?s Grand Letar with the dual speaker setup was a veritable Marshall stack in its day.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The coup de grace of the Grand Letar was the built in light show, which is so complex that it?s difficult to describe.&nbsp; Letritia and her father worked on an idea that utilized Mr. Kandle?s engineering know-how to realize Letritia?s vision.&nbsp; The fretboards, sides, and front of the steel guitar were etched glass that displayed lights that shone from within the guitar.&nbsp; The front panel of the Grand Letar was originally a rising sun motif, which came from Letritia?s initial vision of the instrument.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to World War Two and the Japanese Invasion of Pearl Harbor, Letritia was eventually forced to change the rising sun motif to an art deco motif with musical notes.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Inside the steel guitar was a 1930?s vision of the future?an extensive network of 120 bulbs in four colors that flashed and changed colors as a large motor in the base of the Grand Letar engaged electrical contacts on a large flywheel.&nbsp; On the rear panel of the Grand Letar, a control panel with four rheostats and twelve toggle switches was used to control the brightness and other aspects of the internal ?light show.?<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">When the Grand Letar was finished, National built a road case to transport the instrument.&nbsp; Because of all the etched glass, the instrument could not be transported unless it was secured in the custom-built road case.&nbsp; Unbelievably, the Grand Letar was 265 pounds by itself, and 400 pounds in the road case!&nbsp;

All the major musical instrument manufacturers displayed their products at the convention, and many of the great names in music performed as demonstrators for the various companies.&nbsp; National signed an endorsement deal with Letritia in July, and agreed to transport the instrument to New York and provide her room and board in exchange for Letritia demonstrating the instrument at the National booth.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">While demonstrating the Grand Letar at the New York trade convention, a very interesting thing happened.

Before the song was over, Alvino had quickly left the room, and Letritia never did meet him in person.&nbsp; Letritia was crushed, but more than likely the reality was that Alvino?s mind was blown at what he saw.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Whatever Alvino thought when he saw Letritia performing on the Grand Letar, the fact was she had predated him on a major evolutionary step of the steel guitar.&nbsp; While Gibson guitars had built many experimental steel guitars based on Alvino?s ideas, the Grand Letar was a huge step beyond anything that Gibson had ever conceived of up to then.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What is interesting about this happenstance is that within two years, Alvino Rey and Gibson guitars came out with the Console Grande steel guitar, which was Gibson?s first multi-neck console steel guitar.&nbsp; Alvino?s exquisite Console Grande steel influenced many later players and instrument makers, but the evidence points to Alvino getting the idea after seeing Letritia demonstrating the Grand Letar at this 1937 trade convention.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The dates of Letritia?s innovations can be verified through national press articles about her new instrument.&nbsp; ?The Music Trades? ran an article about Letritia and the Grand Letar in their September 1937 issue.&nbsp; ?Down Beat,? the highly regarded jazz magazine, also ran an article in October 1937.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dates are important because during the mad rush of stringed instrument innovation during the 1930?s, it is often difficult to prove who ?got there first.?&nbsp; The articles written in 1937 prove that Letritia was indeed there first with her impressive list of innovations.</span></span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Until the Grand Letar, lap steels and double-neck lap steels were usually tuned with one or two standard tunings, such as the low bass A tuning for Hawaiian playing or the C6 tuning for jazz.&nbsp; Letritia envisioned being able to cover all harmonic and chordal bases using a playing style that necessitated switching back and forth between the necks many times during each song.&nbsp; The basic ideas that Letritia came up for chord inversions were later utilized by pedal steel players, with their pedals achieving the same result as Letritia?s idea of switching between necks.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The first neck on the Grand Letar was tuned to an A-major (high bass) tuning, A-C#-E-A-C#-E.&nbsp; The second neck was tuned to an E7 with the standard old-school E7 tuning, B-E-D-G#-B-E.&nbsp; The third neck was an A minor tuning which could also make C6th inversions.&nbsp; Lastly, the fourth neck, which was an 8-string, was arranged in two small clusters, with four strings for each.&nbsp; One was tuned to an augmented chord, F-A-C#-F, and one was tuned to a diminished chord, F#-A-C-E.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Grand Letar proved to be very unwieldy to transport, so it was mostly used for big engagements and residencies.&nbsp; In 1939 Letritia and her father came up with a more portable instrument, which was essentially like the Grand Letar without the built in amplifier and light show.&nbsp; This new instrument was called the ?Small Letar.?&nbsp; Most notably, Letritia added a 7</span></span><sup><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">th</span></span></sup><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"> string to each of the standard necks, with one interesting variation on the E7 neck?she added a high F# string on the top of the E7 neck, which when played turned it into an E9 chord, predating the now-standard Nashville E9 tuning by twenty years!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;

The volume control (up and down) worked in a fairly normal way, with a potentiometer and a string, but the tone (side to side) produced three distinct tonal characteristics that can only be described as bass, treble, and super-treble, to make the familiar ?doo-ahh? crashing sound effect that was popular among steel guitar players for several decades.&nbsp; Many years later the same basic concept was applied in a much different type of musical context to become the wah-wah pedal, but we?re getting ahead of ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

There were those who felt that America's presence in Vietnam was an important battle of right versus wrong--that preventing the spread of Communism in far-flung locales was tantamount to preserving democracy at home. There were just as many others who felt that the Vietnam War was an exercise in futility, a confusing jungle conflict where enemy and ally were often one and the same. The people who opposed the war felt that the real reason the nation was in Vietnam was to fill the coffers of the defense industry, and that the hundreds of boys coming home in body bags every month was too high a price to pay.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">For a nation that, at the time, thought of itself as invincible, the Vietnam War pitted a generation of veterans against young idealists, and most significantly for our discussion here, it seemed to pit rural people who considered themselves diehard patriots against city people who felt that the war was wrong, no matter what the government was saying. No one was happy with what was going on in Vietnam.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Merle: "It was like this.

President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in November 1963. His brother, presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, was assassinated in June 1968, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, making the decade one of the bloodiest in the nation's history.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Merle: "If you look back on it now, it was a sad time for America.

Now if they'd been over to Vietnam, and come back, and had on a Vietnam jacket, and they had something to say, I'd listen to 'em. But they hadn't. None of 'em had been anywhere.

Merle insisted in an interview with this author that he was dead serious when he wrote "Okie from Muskogee" and other politically charged numbers like "Fightin' Side of Me." But as time went on, Merle began to take an educated and unbiased look at his political views and personal beliefs.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Merle: "I was dumb as a rock, you know, I thought that the government told us the truth, and I thought that marijuana made you walk around with your mouth open.

The decade had begun innocently enough, with all genres of music, from pop to country, essentially carrying on the innocent themes of the 1950s. When the Beatles came over from England in 1964, it was as if everything changed overnight. Suddenly music wasn't about escape, release, and endless good times--it was now expected to be a harbinger of social change. With the turbulent times affecting everybody in the nation, it wasn't long before the previously staid world of country music was affected by the same sort of social awareness that the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and others had brought into the world of rock.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">It was a much different scenario in the country music world than it was in the rock and roll world, however. For the country western market, right-wing Republican was the norm, and few were willing to speak up for the liberal side of things, even if they felt differently. President Richard Nixon appeared on stage at the Grand Ol' Opry, playing the piano and laughing with Roy Acuff. Records like "Ballad of Two Brothers" by Autry Inman and "Hello Vietnam" by Johnny Wright pulled on patriotic heartstrings and rallied support for the Vietnam War. In the deep South, "under the counter" records on the Reb-Rebel label were huge underground sellers, with records like "Nigger Hatin' Me" by "Johnny Rebel," "Cowboys and Niggers" by "James Crow," and "A Victim of the Big Mess (Called the Great Society)" by the "Son of Mississippi." These were essentially Southern country music "protest" records, the racist redneck equivalent of Country Joe McDonald strumming an acoustic guitar at Woodstock and talking about peace and love. The country music establishment had its own political views, and they weren't about the peace and love bit one iota.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Johnny Cash was virtually the only country singer to speak for left-wing issues during this period, which didn't exactly go over well with the country record-buying public. Cash tackled the treatment of American Indians, spoke up for prisoners, and recorded with Bob Dylan, all of which endeared him to hippies and left-wing liberals but hurt him for years with conservatives.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">When Merle performs "Okie from Muskogee" now, he plays it off like a joke, and he has said in interviews over the years that it was a parody, or written from the perspective of his father, or only half-serious. It wasn't. "Okie from Muskogee" was a statement, and, at least in fall 1969, Merle meant every word of it.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Merle: "I felt the opposite side of the knife. . . .

It's strange, all those people that were fans, people in the business, I didn't even realize it at the time [but] we were really accepted in the rock and roll field. . . . We had songs in the pop charts. You know, Dean Martin was cuttin' my records, and things like that.

The song was a blockbuster in every sense of the word, and the best-known song Merle would ever release. People went wild when he performed it. There was little doubt that he would be performing "Okie from Muskogee" for the rest of his career.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">The song was so popular that Merle included it on all three of his live albums, including the phenomenally successful</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Live in Muskogee</span></span></i></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">album.

"Okie from Muskogee" was so popular that Capitol re-released the single in 1972, using a live version taken from the live Philadelphia album.

Nearly a decade later Merle performed at a Ronald Reagan fundraiser, further fueling the fire. Parodies of "Okie from Muskogee" from the liberal point of view were written and recorded, such as "Asshole from El Paso" by Kinky Friedman and "Hippie from Olema #5" by the Youngbloods.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">What many of the unhappy hippies didn't realize was that Merle Haggard was nobody's puppet. Merle may not have cared for the far left wing, but he also didn't like neoconservatives. Alabama governor and independent right wing presidential candidate George Wallace asked Merle to endorse his 1972 bid for the White House, but Merle refused. Ex-Klansman-turned-politico David Duke asked Merle to do a private party, and Merle told him, in a colorful way, what he could do with his offer. Merle also discovered his own love of marijuana, stating in a 1974 Michigan newspaper interview "Muskogee is the only place I don't smoke it."</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;">Merle's latest interview in High Times magazine <a href="http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/4931">here.</a></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">No one got to hear the song "Somewhere in Between," either. Merle wrote the song in 1970 and recorded it twice, once in 1970 and again in 1971, but it has never seen the light of day until now. A song guaranteed to make neither side happy, it speaks Merle Haggard's state of mind better than any press release ever did. While both the left-leaning hippies and the far-right rednecks wanted Merle to be something they had defined based on their own prejudices, Merle wasn't about to be defined by anyone but himself. "Somewhere in Between" would have probably made the hippies madder and angered Merle's core audience if it had been released at the time of its recording, but it would have shed a little light on the complex personality of Merle Haggard.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">There's a certain class of people who might venture out too far<br />There's the common man who's satisfied with things the way they are<br />There's the acid-taking dopies with their minds eat up inside<br />But it takes all kinds to make the world so wide<br /><br />I stand looking at the left wing, and I turn towards the right<br />And either side don't look too good, examined under light<br />That's just freedom of opinion, and their legal right to choose<br />That's one right I hope we never lose<br /><br />I stand somewhere in between divided wings<br />The liberal left, the narrow right, and the young of 17<br />And I'm not too old to understand the young who disagree<br />And it leaves me standing somewhere in between<br /><br />We analyze the trouble that reflect the current times<br />While we're searching with a question weighing heavy on our minds<br />And I haven't heard an answer that'll change things overnight<br />And that's one thing I know for sure is right<br /><br />And I stand somewhere in between divided wings<br />The liberal left, the narrow right, and the young of 17<br />And I'm not too old to understand the young who disagree<br />And it leaves me standing somewhere in between<br />It leaves me standing somewhere in between</span></span></i></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">--Merle Haggard, "Somewhere in Between" (revised lyrics, 1971)</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Hear Merle sing "Somewhere In Between" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn_JClPEGXQ">here. </a></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"></span></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">In 1990 Merle released "Me and Crippled Soldiers," an anti-flag-burning song, on his</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Blue Jungle</span></span></i></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">album.

Merle may be a country boy without much formal education, but unlike many of his supporters and detractors who have doctorates or are in positions of power, Merle has listened to both sides, formed an opinion, spoken his mind, listened and learned more over the years, and (unafraid to contradict his own earlier positions) spoken his mind again--with fairness, regardless of whether anyone wanted to listen.

When it came time to put a pickup in Jim?s first standard guitar, he made up his mind that he would drive up to Downey and see Paul Bigsby. &nbsp;Remember, these were the steamboat days of the electric guitar?Fender and Gibson wouldn?t sell you one of their pickups unless it was attached to one of their guitars.&nbsp; For the amateur guitar builder of 1951, the pickup was a magical, mystical thing.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Jim drove up to Downey to see Paul Bigsby, with Scotty Broyles in tow.&nbsp; As Scotty remembers it, </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">?Jim asked Paul if he would sell him a pickup, and Paul said he?d have to see his work, and if it was good enough, he might consider it.&nbsp; Jim went out to his car and got the guitar he was working on, and Bigsby spent about ten minutes slowly looking it over.&nbsp; Finally, without saying anything, Paul walked over to a cabinet mounted on the wall, pulls out a pickup, comes back over to Jim and tells him the pickups are fifty dollars, and they?re the same price if he takes just the pickup or leaves the instrument to have him install the pickup himself.?</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Paul Bigsby installed the pickups on Jim?s new guitar and Scotty?s mandolin.&nbsp; During the time that Scotty?s mandolin was in Bigsby?s shop, Bigsby was also putting the finishing touches on a four-string electric mandolin made for Tiny Moore, mandolin player with Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Scotty recalls how Tiny Moore became associated with the five-string electric mandolin: </span></span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">?Jim Harvey had taken my unfinished mandolin up there to Paul Bigsby to have a five-string pickup installed.&nbsp; Well, it was sitting around Bigsby?s shop for a few weeks while he installed the pickup, and about that time, Tiny Moore came and visited Bigsby to see how his new electric mandolin was coming.&nbsp; Tiny had ordered a four-string mandolin, but when he saw my Harvey five-string mandolin laying there, he changed his mind and told Paul right then and there his had to be a five-string too.&nbsp; Paul was irritated, because he was just about done with Tiny?s instrument!&nbsp; Eventually Tiny got his way, and that?s the reason Tiny Moore?s Bigsby had five strings instead of four.?</span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Buskirk was one of the country?s great mandolin players (Fretboard Journal did a nice article on Buskirk in Issue #14), but he was equally at home on tenor banjo, guitar, or his favorite, the mandola.&nbsp; Buskirk had a long career dating back to the 1930?s, including stints touring behind Tex Ritter and Gene Austin, a few years in Memphis playing for Eddie Hill, and a few years in Dallas in the early 1950?s, where he recorded with Lefty Frizzell and many others.&nbsp;

It was here that he helped a struggling young man named Willie Nelson.&nbsp; Willie was a disc jockey and songwriter and singer, but hadn?t had much luck until Buskirk set him up teaching guitar lessons at Buskirk?s music studio in Pasadena, Texas.&nbsp; As Willie recalls, Buskirk would keep him one lesson ahead of the students.&nbsp; When Willie?s recording of ?Nite Life? came out in 1960, the record label read ?Paul Buskirk and his Little Men, featuring Hugh Nelson, vocals.?&nbsp;

Austin College of Fine Arts in Nacogdoches, and gave the school the rights to the Willie Nelson songs, which essentially would keep the scholarship fund going for the next hundred years.&nbsp; Before Buskirk died, Huey returned the Bigsby mandolin Paul had given him so that Buskirk could sell it and keep the money (it wound up in the Chinery collection, and is now part of a collection on the East Coast).&nbsp; The Harvey doubleneck, played no more, sat in Huey?s workshop.&nbsp; Every now and then, Huey would look at it and ponder restoration of the thing?then think better of it.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">When I got Huey?s contact number, as luck would have it, it turned out that he knew me.&nbsp;

Additional help came from Steve Soest, who magically straightened the bowed necks, and pickup guru Don Mare, who supplied four 1950?s style Strat pickups.&nbsp; When it was done, it was as if a time machine had gone back to the day it was completed and snatched it from Jim Harvey?s shop.&nbsp;
