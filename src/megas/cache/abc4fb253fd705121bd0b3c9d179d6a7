After announcing the closure of its short wave service at the end of the B16 season (RadioUser, June 2017: xx), it can still be heard, thanks to WRMI and the Shortwave Service. Both stations now relay Radio Tirana's daily broadcasts via Kall Krekel in Germany and Okeechobee in the US. <br /><br />The schedule for the Albanian state broadcaster is Monday to Saturday to Europe on 6005kHz via Kall Krekel from 1800 to 1830 UTC in Italian, 1830 to 1900 UTC in French, 1900 to 1930 UTC in English and 1930 to 2000 in German, which is also heard on 3985kHz. North American audiences can tune into a daily English broadcast from Monday to Friday on 5850kHz via WRMI in Okeechobee at 2300 UTC.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>If that news doesn't tempt you, then maybe the programme details will. Each broadcast commences with a news bulletin and, on weekdays, a press review. On Saturdays, you'll hear Mosaic of the Week. Monday's transmission has programmes on culture, sport and Albania in a Week. An interview is carried on Tuesday, while Wednesday looks at integration with the EU and has a music programme called Hits Through the Years. Facts and economics abound on Thursday along with tourism. There is a profile of individuals and organisations on Friday, while Saturday consists of tourism, culture and the popular folk music programme.<br /><br />Radio Tirana's daily programmes in English, German, French, Italian, Greek, Serbian and Turkish can <a href="https://rtsh.al/radio-tirana-3">now also be heard online from Monday to Saturday. </a></div><div><br /></div><div>Apologies for the lack of posts in recent months. I was the editorial assistant at RadioUser for six months, which didn't work out but took lots of time, Along with that, I had a house move and lots of political activity too. I hope to retain the blog and update more regularly but cannot promise anything!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/feeds/3227492483519148833/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4372603247118502035&postID=3227492483519148833";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/3227492483519148833";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/3227492483519148833";s:4:"link";s:63:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/2017/05/govorit-tirana.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Chrissy Brand";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13644679705890329140";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:3;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4372603247118502035.post-3648424958721068204";s:9:"published";s:29:"2016-12-27T17:54:00.003+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2016-12-27T18:01:59.561+00:00";s:5:"title";s:32:"How does your Radio Garden grow?";s:12:"atom_content";s:3429:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nl4h9vCiSu4/WGKqFWEdPJI/AAAAAAAABoA/iZFi-LjQtlYIP7K-_YJ19zXVxxE5GaLXQCLcB/s1600/RadioGarden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="247" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nl4h9vCiSu4/WGKqFWEdPJI/AAAAAAAABoA/iZFi-LjQtlYIP7K-_YJ19zXVxxE5GaLXQCLcB/s400/RadioGarden.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">There have been many radio portals that have come and gone in this internet age.

You can find us by asking for Radio Praha on your virtual reality implant or on your smart screen. Watch us live every day at 1800 Universal Time, or at your leisure from our list of past broadcasts. As always our hour long transmission begins with world news. Today's programmes also include My Czechia Republica which features an air-powered car designer originally from Cambodia, an item on the Moravian wine festival, previews of the Prague summer jazz concerts and listeners' comments.<br /><br />But first the news headlines: The president of the United Countries of Europe, Zelma Lassnig has confirmed that she will be standing down at the end of her term in 2097. Czech Green Party leader Alena ?elezný has announced her intention to stand. <br /><br />The Czech cruise liner Boleslava III arrived in the port of Genoa with 2,000 Pacific Islanders. This is one of the final boat loads of climate change refugees to arrive in Europe. The 2,000 will join other Pacific islanders in the community of Nový Ráj, just outside of Brno. There are now half a million Pacific islanders that have established themselves and integrated across Europe since their atolls and homes started to become inhabitable due to the rising sea levels some half a century ago. <br /><br />The Czech exploration team to Mars headed by Jana Balek is due to take off from Woomera in South Australia in three days' time. You can join Jana and her team in an exclusive Q&amp;A session run by Radio Prague on the air at this time tomorrow night. Sign up on our vlogcast page with your contact details and your questions and we will select people to take part...</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br />Carp is back on the menu at a top Czech restaurant and it's causing concern. Carp, like all fish and meat, had been banned on cruelty grounds throughout Europe since the mid 2060s but the recent explosion in heritage dining experiences is challenging this. Helene Velinger reports...<br /><br />...The weather for the Czech capital today - and it's been another hot one, with this summer looking like it will be the hottest year on record in the country. We may possibly break last year's record high of 41C come Saturday. A reminder that the water rationing collection times for Malá Strana and Staré M?sto return to their regular four hour evening pattern, from 8pm to midnight, from tomorrow. <br /><br /><br />...Join us tomorrow when we are at the Prague zoo, where they welcomed its most recent addition yesterday, a Sumatran orangutan, born in captivity. We'll also be previewing the new soccer season and asking if European Champions Varnsdorf can also retain their domestic league title. The 400 million Euros that they paid in the summer for India's World Cup winning defender Jag Naleem will certainly aid their chances.<br /><br />...Listeners' letters this time include Anna Kesten from Ohio, USA  who complements us on the live coverage of the European Literature festival last month. Anna says she has been using an app called Czechtech to translate the wining entrants' works straight into English on her audio player. Tomas Collingwood from New Zealand contacted us to say how much he enjoyed the programme aired from the retro shortwave transmitter based in Germany and being run by the European Broadcasting Union. He said it was just like back in the day of his great grandparents who used to listen on shortwave last century. It will certainly get him a special QSL card - this years' series feature great Czech architecture of the mid 21st century.  </span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">...And finally, a reminder that this year is Radio Prague's 160th anniversary. As part of celebrations we would like to invite our audience to take part in a competition. Let us know what you think Radio Prague will be like in another 160 years, in the year 2256!

The content is diverse covering the academic and the mainstream, podcasting and social media, technical, talent management and new programme formats. For instance KIIS 106.5 presenters Kyle and Jackie talk about their move across Sydney from 2Day FM to front a new breakfast show; then there?s Professor Emma Rodero and Martin de Munnik exploring the impact of audio on the brain, what can be learnt from how voices and music are used and what the future?s more intense commercials and radio shows may look like.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /> <br />About a month later the International Radio Fair (IRF) takes places in Milan, from 7-10 April.

It bills itself as ?the leading platform for showcasing and debating the business of music radio content; the world?s most consumed medium? joining up with Radio City Milan and to present Europe?s largest public on-air radio festival at the Piazza Gae Aulenti. There will be over 20 international plus 50 Italian radio stations who will broadcast radio shows live-on-air to millions of their listeners back in their home cities.

That was back in 1982. In 1990 the sound emanating changed to  a strange buzzing sound, in short blasts.&nbsp;</span><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Its source was a mystery for a long time, but numbers/spy station experts tracked it and discovered the transmitter was located near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Povarovo,_Moscow_Oblast">Povarovo</a>, Russia. Although not strictly a numbers stations, being a buzz most of the time, it still falls into that category of strange and mysterious signals. Occasionally the buzzing would stop and codes would be read out. One that was noted at  2100 UTC&nbsp;on 24 December 1997 transmitted the following message:<br /><br /> "Ya UVB-76, Ya UVB-76. 180 08 BROMAL 74 27 99 14. Boris, Roman, Olga, Mikhail, Anna, Larisa. 7 4 2 7 9 9 1 4."<br /><br />Self identifying as UVB76 (Cyrillic: ???-76) , in 2010 things got a little spookier. Buzzing temporarily stopped, the sounds of phone calls were transmitted , what could have been engineers were heard, dismantling equipment.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The station then relocated and last autumn (2015) it was believed to be situated near St Petersburg. It also added another frequency to its armoury, that of 7000kHz. We still don't know what its real purpose is, so the mystery continues... Tune to 4625 and 7000kHz for yourself.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/feeds/5705001369302438157/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4372603247118502035&postID=5705001369302438157";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/5705001369302438157";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/5705001369302438157";s:4:"link";s:83:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/2016/01/still-buzzin-after-all-these-years.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Chrissy Brand";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13644679705890329140";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:16;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4372603247118502035.post-2920663806209238376";s:9:"published";s:29:"2016-01-10T05:32:00.000+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2016-01-11T14:04:00.513+00:00";s:5:"title";s:56:"Stateside state of radio: New York State and Utah State ";s:12:"atom_content";s:20204:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0PFqhCjoDIY/VoviNzswVqI/AAAAAAAABh4/4zgjFCF75cM/s1600/IMG_8348.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0PFqhCjoDIY/VoviNzswVqI/AAAAAAAABh4/4zgjFCF75cM/s640/IMG_8348.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Photo by Tim Sutton-Brand</span></i></div><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Extracts from some of my Radio User columns in 2015 (July, August &amp; September) and January 2016, amalgamating my tales from a trip last spring to the USA.</span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">2015 was a very good year for me radiowise. I was fortunate enough to travel overseas twice and to be able to enjoy some of the radio scene whilst there. On a trip to the USA I enjoyed the packed FM bands of New York City, Las Vegas, Buffalo and, across the 48th parallel in Canada, Toronto. Medium wave, although heavy on the sports networks and shock jocks, also threw out some more interesting catches. KTNN The Voice of the Navajo Nation on 660kHz being one such example. Another highlight was my impromptu visit to the Cedar City studios of Cherry Creek Radio, an umbrella network of Utah radio stations. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-element: para-border-div; padding: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm; padding: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Snowstorms at Bryce Canyon made for a challenging but memorable trek although the radio in that area was less rewarding; however Utah Public Radio was a beacon of quality and included relays of the BBC World Service as well as a thought-provoking series on Utah dialects. Stations such as Eagle "rock revolution" and Planet "Southern Utah's best variety" provided a sound track to that part of our trip. The national park radio station on 1590kHz kept us updated with weather checks and tourist information. You can read other details of my radio observations in the USA in July, August and September 2015's Radio User (for DX International blog readers these are posted below). <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm; padding: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h2><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Stateside state of radio <i>i</i><o:p></o:p></span></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In the spring I was in the USA on a family holiday. We spent a week in New York State, a couple of nights in Las Vegas and a second week exploring the canyons of Utah. I took a new radio with me, a Tecsun PL 360, which is a cheap and cheerful (but also useful) handheld receiver. I won?t go into details of the hundreds of FM stations I heard as FM is not in the remit of this column but suffice to say the band was packed in New York City and Vegas, and there was enough to choose from on FM when I was out in the wilds of Zion and Bryce Canyon. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Cedar City is a town in southern Utah where we had a one night stopover and radio wise it threw me a curveball, as the Americans might say. Not only was the FM and mw band packed with a variety of genres and styles of broadcasting, I even stumbled upon the studios of the local radio station! The small but nicely formed downtown area of Cedar City has been rejuvenated in a tasteful way, with independent vintage shops, cafes and a second hand bookstore. While looking at a Mexican restaurant?s menu I glanced to my right and saw the offices and studios of Cherry Creek Radio. In no time I was in the studio of medium wave station KSUB, watching Programme Director Tim Nesmith at the controls while Bryan Hyde presented an afternoon show on the topic of health. Programmer Andrea Wright then took us into the station office where we discussed radio and took photos. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DLZY5cUsjIg/VoviO3xLl_I/AAAAAAAABiM/DSv5NRbN9Hc/s1600/IMG_9631%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DLZY5cUsjIg/VoviO3xLl_I/AAAAAAAABiM/DSv5NRbN9Hc/s320/IMG_9631%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="292" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Photo of Chrissy Brand &nbsp;by Tim Sutton-Brand</span></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Cherry Creek Radio is an umbrella organisation which consists of several FM and medium wave stations in the Utah region (and seven other western States). However they also use some syndicated programming and I was taken aback to hear the views of infamous shock jock Rush Limbaugh - he certainly let listeners know just what he thought of Hilary Clinton in a diatribe that lasted for a whole programme. I am astonished that this conservative 64 year old?s radio show is aired on more than 600 stations across the USA.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_DSRh_qpRiU/Vo05Ba4SBpI/AAAAAAAABjo/9Favccs0Bp0/s1600/WP_20150417_22_23_07_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_DSRh_qpRiU/Vo05Ba4SBpI/AAAAAAAABjo/9Favccs0Bp0/s320/WP_20150417_22_23_07_Pro.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lEez0P1ugw4/Vo03kTy_KDI/AAAAAAAABi4/KRzKFP7iPgk/s1600/CC%2Bfor%2BRU.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="131" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lEez0P1ugw4/Vo03kTy_KDI/AAAAAAAABi4/KRzKFP7iPgk/s200/CC%2Bfor%2BRU.jpg" width="200" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f0iEkmpmnsA/Vo03kcn4SjI/AAAAAAAABjI/oRqmzzqyqCM/s1600/WP_20150417_22_30_28_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="111" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f0iEkmpmnsA/Vo03kcn4SjI/AAAAAAAABjI/oRqmzzqyqCM/s200/WP_20150417_22_30_28_Pro.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pFLzVP_VGFs/Vo03kULyQ7I/AAAAAAAABi0/fPQ8Nv_LEvU/s1600/CCR%2Bcar%2Bfor%2BComm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pFLzVP_VGFs/Vo03kULyQ7I/AAAAAAAABi0/fPQ8Nv_LEvU/s200/CCR%2Bcar%2Bfor%2BComm.jpg" width="158" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-69y6UV6Go4c/Vo05BS6bFNI/AAAAAAAABjs/hilHCy2IK48/s1600/WP_20150417_22_30_57_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-69y6UV6Go4c/Vo05BS6bFNI/AAAAAAAABjs/hilHCy2IK48/s200/WP_20150417_22_30_57_Pro.jpg" width="111" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S_HUBiplozc/Vo03kqy9YsI/AAAAAAAABi8/Jy-DOxvJGBI/s1600/WP_20150417_22_35_50_Smart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S_HUBiplozc/Vo03kqy9YsI/AAAAAAAABi8/Jy-DOxvJGBI/s200/WP_20150417_22_35_50_Smart.jpg" width="112" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><i>Some of the delights of Cedar City and Cherry Creek Radio</i></span></div><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Other mw stations which I logged overnight in Cedar City included KSI on 640kHz which is ?More Stimulating Talk in Southern California?, aimed at Los Angeles and Orange County. On 660kHz came KTNN the Voice of the Navajo nation in the native language and the occasional English from a DJ called JJ who was playing requests from listeners which consisted mostly of hour after hour of alternative country music. When I tuned to 1030kHz KTWO from Casper in Wyoming the programming consisted mostly of another of the country?s many conservative shock jocks, Sean Hannity, whose syndicated show is heard on some 500 USA stations.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">At Niagara Falls it was very enjoyable to spend a late night session listening to lots of Canadian stations on medium wave and FM, with the cities of Hamilton and Ontario just over the border. A female sports reporter was commentating on the Florida Panther versus New Jersey Devils ice hockey match on WFAN 660kHz. There was more ice hockey with Buffalo taking on Pittsburgh on WGR radio on 550kHz, while I was delighted to hear what I read is the only station in North America on the 530kHz frequency, Brampton Ontario?s multilingual CIAO AM. Classical music, an advert for a benefit concert for Ukraine. Other languages that the station airs in includes Hungarian, Punjabi and Bosnian. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">CFTR 680kHz from downtown Toronto gave me news and sport while Zoomer Radio on 740kHz from Toronto had Saturday night Grandstand and a comedy show, Just For Laughs. Other stations included WBEN in Buffalo on 930kHz with news and talk, WJJL on 1440kHz playing 1950s music for the southern (US) side of Niagara Falls. A baseball match featuring the Philadelphia Phillies was also heard on WPHT using 1210kHz. This is a 50,000-watt clear-channel station which broadcasts in an omnidirectional pattern that allows it to cover most of the eastern half of North America at night. Finally for now, there was more ice hockey from Canada on 610kHz where CKTB in St Catherine?s Ontario covered a Toronto Maple Leafs game.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-element: para-border-div; padding: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm; padding: 0cm;"><br /></div></div><h2><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Stateside state of radio&nbsp;<i>ii</i></span></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">As much as I love radio, when you have five days and nights in New York City, there are many other competing interests. This glorious city of bridges and skyscrapers, green spaces and bars catering to every taste, this Gotham city of rich diversity, of art and commerce, needed most of my full attention. However while there I did manage to spend some late nights and early mornings monitoring the bands for local signals. As you would expect, the FM band was crammed full of stations, offering the whole gamut of musical and talk genres, and in several languages: Spanish, Russian and Cantonese as well as English. I am sure there are many more stations which I didn?t get to hear who offer programmes for the 50% of the New York City population who don?t count English as their first language.&nbsp; With so many stations coming in loud and clear throughout Manhattan (and way beyond) from the antenna on top of the Empire State Building and from neighbouring Queens, New Jersey and further afield, there was no shortage of quality radio.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">On medium wave there were a fair few stations but I spent less time on this band, concentrating more on FM in the moments. However, WSNR on 620kHz is a Russian language station based in Jersey City, which at the weekends airs a Caribbean programme called <span style="background: white; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">One Caribbean Radio</span><span style="background: white;">.</span> <span style="background: white;">The station is owned by Gregory Davidzon who is a Russian-American media mogul who also publishes a weekly newspaper under the name of Blackstrap Broadcasting. The fast and furious sports talk radio in Spanish on 1050kHz was WEPN, while country and western music in the big apple could be found thanks to WABC on 770kHz.&nbsp; WZRC on 1380 and 1480kHz caters for the Cantonese community. Other familiar names I heard included WBBR Bloomberg on 1130kHz and CBS? WINS on 1010kHz, which included an interesting programme all about pesticides and the types of insects that are to be avoided when you travel way out west. Religion was there of course, for example WLIB with urban gospel music and talk, and WWRV a Christian station in Spanish from Woodhaven in the borough of Queens (another Spanish Christian station was WNYH in Huntingdon). WNSW is a catholic station in English from New Jersey, while WOR ?the voice of New York? was an entertaining and informative talk station on 710kHz. Musically my medium wave vote goes to WWRJ in New Jersey?s La Invasora, playing Hispanic ballads and mariachi on 1600kHz.</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-element: para-border-div; padding: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm; padding: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">On the streets, it was sad to see the famous and once financially robust chain of Radio Shack struggling a while back. I thought they had gone under but it seems they have a healthy online presence and some stores still exist in the USA. Although I didn?t look too hard, I only saw a couple of Radio Shacks which had long closed down. I recall my first visits to the chain back in the late 1980s when I took a greyhound bus around the USA. On a six week road trip from Cape Cod to Key West, San Antonio to Chicago, I was grateful for the little Panasonic radio (an RF B10) I picked up in a New Orleans branch. This small and effective eight band radio served me well, especially on the long overnight legs of some journeys. I?ve fond memories of tuning to The Christian Science Monitor?s daily news and feature show from Boston, 1 Norway Street, and music programmes from some Brazilian and Mexican stations.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm; padding: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div></div><h2><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Stateside in Zion<o:p></o:p></span></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">To finish off my short reports on what I heard on the radio dial while in USA in April, we now take another look at southern Utah. We stayed just outside Zion National Park, in Glendale, which was a great one-road town leading up to the National Park hemmed in by stunning valleys. It was a good base, especially in the evenings after a hard day?s trekking. You could wander the art galleries and eat in an excellent independent Mexican restaurant. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMQHTZGQVeg/VoviOquwnTI/AAAAAAAABh8/1x5xOp4qFss/s1600/IMG_9278.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMQHTZGQVeg/VoviOquwnTI/AAAAAAAABh8/1x5xOp4qFss/s640/IMG_9278.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Photo by Tim Sutton-Brand</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Radiowise in the short time that I was there was not much to report on medium wave or FM. It was difficult to hear much on FM in the valley we were staying in.&nbsp; Utah Public Radio with classical music and informative programmes was on 90.7 MHz; KONY from St George on 99.9 MHz played plenty of country music. The public emergency service channel in Orderville Utah was on a loop on 92.9 KUOU, while 105.1 The Planet was a very ordinary FM station with a slogan of ?Southern Utah?s best variety?. Medium wave did not fare much better, with KNX from Los Angeles, ?Southern California?s news and talk station? on 1070kHz being a highlight. The Zion National Park Information station was on 1610kHz and KSL from Salt Lake City News Radio forewarned us of the eight to 16 inches of snow expected the next day in the mountains. But it?s always fun to tune to the local stations when you are on holiday, although there is rarely time on a road trip like we were on to dedicate yourself to serious listening.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CDMrwugW7PY/VovjQA7yF2I/AAAAAAAABik/5fTzTvItXb8/s1600/Bryce%2BCanyon%2BNational%2BPark%2Bradio%2Bstation%2Bon%2B1590kHz%2Baccurately%2Bpredicts%2Bheavy%2Bsnow%2BPhoto%2BTim%2BSutton%2BBrand.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="428" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CDMrwugW7PY/VovjQA7yF2I/AAAAAAAABik/5fTzTvItXb8/s640/Bryce%2BCanyon%2BNational%2BPark%2Bradio%2Bstation%2Bon%2B1590kHz%2Baccurately%2Bpredicts%2Bheavy%2Bsnow%2BPhoto%2BTim%2BSutton%2BBrand.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Bryce Canyon National Park radio station on 1590kHz accurately predicted heavy snow&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Photo Tim Sutton Brand</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background: white;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"> </span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/feeds/2920663806209238376/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4372603247118502035&postID=2920663806209238376";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/2920663806209238376";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/2920663806209238376";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/2016/01/stateside-state-of-radio-new-york-state.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Chrissy Brand";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13644679705890329140";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:17;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4372603247118502035.post-7896239780659405698";s:9:"published";s:29:"2016-01-07T12:24:00.001+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2016-02-02T16:12:50.199+00:00";s:5:"title";s:52:"OLX Czech numbers station HQ, & Radio Prague in 2016";s:12:"atom_content";s:4763:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Aap5nSvdzEU/Vo5YcoTvPVI/AAAAAAAABkI/PL2M73Jmht8/s1600/OLx.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="428" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Aap5nSvdzEU/Vo5YcoTvPVI/AAAAAAAABkI/PL2M73Jmht8/s640/OLx.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Offices of the OLX Czech numbers station!</span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br />Radio Prague is still the only radio station I know of that issue QSL cards for reception of its internet broadcasts. <a href="http://www.radio.cz/en/static/qsl/qsl-cards"><span style="color: blue;">2016?s series will feature Czech religious monuments</span></a>.

This Sunday dose of intelligent literature covers fact and fiction, it can delve into real life dramas, psychological journeys, politics, espionage and corruption, travel and health. Anything and everything in fact.<br /><br />Last Sunday?s (3 January 2016) &nbsp;was a repeat from July 2015 which covered the trials and tribulations, the difficulties of a Palestinian-Czech family. Written by Jana Kotaishová this <a href="http://www.radio.cz/en/section/books/jana-kotaishova-and-a-palestinian-story-through-czech-eyes"><span style="color: blue;">very moving and thought-provoking</span></a> book, and programme is summed up best by this quote form the programme; ?When she saw the level of prejudice and ignorance in the Czech Republic about Palestine and Palestinians she wrote a book about the reality of life for Palestinians over the last eighty years, all from the perspective of a single family. What makes the book so powerful is that members of her husband?s family tell their own stories in the first person, based on her own long interviews with them.?<br /><br />The other programme on Sunday 3 January's broadcast &nbsp;was the monthly <i>Mailbag</i> show which gave the answer to the station's last quiz of 2015: The mystery personality being tightrope walker Rudy Omankowski Jr. who was famous overseas too.

This is the case when you attend the European DX Council?s annual conferences. EDXC is an umbrella organisation of European wide DX clubs, with links to similar organisations on other continents. I attended 2014?s EDXC Conference in the south of France (see Radio User December 2015) and in 2015 the 48th conference took place, hosted by the St. Petersburg DX Club.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: start;"></span><br /></span><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; text-align: start;">There is great camaraderie amongst the delegates and speakers, sharing our common love of all aspects of radio. The conference sessions are held at a leisurely pace without dominating the whole day so there is enough time for excursions laid on by the organisers. This year these included a visit to the home of the inventor of radio (according to many Russian sources): A.S. Popov?s apartment and laboratory at the St. Petersburg Electrotechnical University complete with interesting talks from two local experts, Larisa Zolotinkina and Mikhail Partala.</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: start;"></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: start;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: start;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M8p-9U_Laqw/VorprK5sjRI/AAAAAAAABgQ/I75p2xPK6Rg/s1600/20150918_213554.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="384" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M8p-9U_Laqw/VorprK5sjRI/AAAAAAAABgQ/I75p2xPK6Rg/s640/20150918_213554.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">There were also trips to two local medium wave radio stations, one being a newcomer on the dial, Radio Bonch. It is named after Russian radio pioneer MA Bonch-Bruyevich. Housed in the St. Petersburg Bonch-Bruyevich State University of Telecommunications, the station made and aired a programme devoted to the EDXC conference, which went out on a loop on 1593kHz for several hours. EDXC Secretary General Kari Kivekäs was interviewed as were other delegates including the conference host, Alexander Beryozkin.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ArkMvIKHQrk/VoruiN_QdoI/AAAAAAAABhg/lWNm2fOM-O8/s1600/20150921_101624.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ArkMvIKHQrk/VoruiN_QdoI/AAAAAAAABhg/lWNm2fOM-O8/s320/20150921_101624.jpg" width="192" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><br style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Russian Orthodox Christian radio station Pravoslavnoye Radio on 828kHz was the other station visited by conference delegates. It is one of just a few stations in the area that still use medium wave. The others include Radio Maria on 1053kHz and Radio Teos on 1089kHz. In what seems an unholy alliance, but one which appears to work, Pravoslavnoye Radio shares its studio and frequency with communist station Radiogazeta Slovo.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WBskLh7r3gM/Vorq4LDVMOI/AAAAAAAABgc/o5pFUOhbNK8/s1600/20150922_143656.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="192" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WBskLh7r3gM/Vorq4LDVMOI/AAAAAAAABgc/o5pFUOhbNK8/s320/20150922_143656.jpg" width="320" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VT1cwVPB8ZA/Vorq4Aeix4I/AAAAAAAABgg/pHVxsfytWIs/s1600/20150922_085200.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="192" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VT1cwVPB8ZA/Vorq4Aeix4I/AAAAAAAABgg/pHVxsfytWIs/s320/20150922_085200.jpg" style="cursor: move;" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I experienced the latter in perfect conditions. Sitting on a sofa in the spacious hallway of St. Petersburg DX club member Omar Cheishvili I had a lovely view of their suburban garden in its autumn colours. I was surrounded by about 15 vintage Soviet radios, all lovingly restored by Omar. He tuned two of these, one at each end of the room, to 828kHz and I was regaled by powerful speeches broadcast live on Radiogazeta Slovo booming out with deep resonance. It was a full Soviet Union radio experience but without any of the discomfort or persecution.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sKpSiyM7HFg/Vorn47v6NzI/AAAAAAAABf0/ZcIGvgP-Y5E/s1600/20150921_130651.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sKpSiyM7HFg/Vorn47v6NzI/AAAAAAAABf0/ZcIGvgP-Y5E/s400/20150921_130651.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /><br />In the hotel I also heard most of the 35 or so FM stations in the city and will mention some of those in this month?s Radio Website column, so that you too can listen to them, albeit online rather than direct from a radio. Over breakfast one morning I was delighted to be interviewed for the Rhein-Main Radio Club (RMRC) by Dr Harald Gabler. This &nbsp;formed part of a one hour broadcast in English about the conference, to be aired in December (they have done the same in previous years) followed by a special one hour broadcast in Russian, in cooperation with the St. Petersburg DX Club, targeted to Russia and the Far East.  Keep an eye on the Rhein-Maine Radio Club website <a href="http://www.rmrc.de/">http://www.rmrc.de</a>  and&nbsp;<a href="http://swldxbulgaria.blogspot.co.uk/">http://swldxbulgaria.blogspot.co.uk/</a> for details.<br /><br />The EDXC conference sessions themselves were also a real treat. Presentations included Andrey Fyodorov talking about shortwave broadcasts in Russian. Before World War II there were almost no Russian radio broadcasts at a time when the Third Reich aired 31 languages. Interestingly the BBC, who began broadcasts to the USSR in 1942, were not popular to begin with as they were perceived by Russian audiences to sound unfriendly. By the 1950s specialist programmes in Russian included those targeting youth with music and some aimed at a female-only audience.  In the 1970s there was a battle of the airwaves with Chile, when General Pinochet?s Voice of Chile aired in Russian via a powerful transmission network.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x2yilhRS1HM/Vorr-VNC20I/AAAAAAAABg8/kDiYIQMhrBE/s1600/20150920_072818.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x2yilhRS1HM/Vorr-VNC20I/AAAAAAAABg8/kDiYIQMhrBE/s320/20150920_072818.jpg" width="192" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ijTWCx8RNKU/VorrMicEqNI/AAAAAAAABgs/TlGcXntCr1c/s1600/20150920_170513.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ijTWCx8RNKU/VorrMicEqNI/AAAAAAAABgs/TlGcXntCr1c/s320/20150920_170513.jpg" width="192" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Nearer to home there was an agreement between the USSR and its eastern European satellite countries that no shortwave transmissions were to beamed by the latter to its big brother. However, once a month the eastern European stations were permitted to send programmes to Moscow to be broadcast directly from the Soviet capital. Romanian resisted this and stared broadcasting in Russian in 1975 under the dictator Ceausescu?s direction. In the 1980s other cracks in the agreement had appeared, with radio stations in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest all transmitting Russian to the USSR. By this time Russian language services on shortwave were commonplace from many international broadcasters including two who remain on shortwave today, namely the state broadcasters of Turkey and Korea. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">There were interesting discussions and debates after many of the presentations and I empathise with Mikhail Nevolin when he stated that music radio will die out before talk radio, as that provides the more popular shows. Mikhail, of the St Petersburg DX Club and also the city's Naval Academy, also gave a presentation on Christian radio stations in St Petersburg. Other talks included Victor Rezunkov from Radio Liberty talking about transmitting pirate radio stations back in the 1970s, with the engaging title of ?Radio hooligans of the 1970s in a USSR province: a sip of freedom?. </span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Technical topics were also on the agenda with talks by Alexander Gromov on ?Modern SDR techniques in amateur radio and DXing? and ?Receiving antenna: electric or magnetic?? by Dr Anatoly Bobkov. There were also presentations from Alexander Beryozkin on his experiences of radio while holidaying on the Costa del Sol and Harald Gabler spoke of his DXing home on the Portuguese Algarve coast, which is available for DXers to rent at a very reasonable rate. Risto Vähäkainu gave a good overview of DXing in Finland today, which also touched on the past. I was fascinated to learn that Finnish composer Sibelius was an early DXer who listened to German stations in the 1920s and 30s. Over 70 countries have been logged on FM in Finland, quite an achievement, and when you put that alongside the 3,000 medium wave stations from North America which have been heard (2,100 of which have been verified) you realise why Finland still has such a thriving DX community. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">There was good news from Alexander Beryozkin who announced that the Russian government has plans to resume shortwave broadcasts in 2016, probably funded from the Russian Ministry of Defence. This could include the Voice of Russia. Perhaps the most defiant quote of the conference also came from Alexander: ?Radio will never die and DXing will never die!?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Every EDXC conference has an elegant evening banquet which seemed even more convivial this year, undoubtedly due to the excellent company, good food and wine and the many vodka-fuelled toasts. Each delegate rose in turn to tell their own radio story and how they became involved in the hobby and the evening flew by. Part of my own tale, translated expertly by the much called upon Alexander Smulsky, was from my days at the BBC World Service Information Centre and Shop in Bush House. It concerned a Norwegian lady who came in one day having missed the end of play on the radio due to the vagaries of shortwave propagation. I tracked down the script from the drama department, she sat and read the play right through and then announced she didn?t understand the ending anyway!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The day after the banquet there was another fabulous feast which lasted from about 1pm to 8pm at the home of Omar Cheishvili and Svetlana Kuzmina. We experienced their generous Georgian hospitality and also got to see the St. Petersburg DX Club's new headquarters which is being built in the house. Along with talk of radio and much more besides we also heard more about Omar?s passion of collecting Soviet and Russian vintage broadcasting receivers.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I left a little of my heart in St Petersburg but returned with a winter?s worth of memories - this wonderful city has so many museums and galleries, palaces and churches, impressive statues and 300 years of eventful history.  Although tempted by the 19th century art I was more drawn to 20th Century history and the World War II siege of Leningrad. I was also fascinated by the legacy of the Soviet past, visiting a museum on the subject (The State Museum of Political History of Russia) plus the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications packed with vintage radios and some lovely old post boxes too. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Dotted around the city some statues of Marx, Engels and Lenin still remain. Although Lenin died just as radio broadcasting was taking off, he could see its power and potential. He followed closely the work of the aforementioned Bonch-Bruyevich and wanted a radio network to be implemented with some urgency, writing that ?the newspaper without paper and without distances that you are creating will be a great thing?. He lived to hear some of his own speeches broadcast on Russian radio in 1922.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tcH7KT0HtE/Vorr-F5rjaI/AAAAAAAABg4/DlKxfvilqdA/s1600/20150922_105231.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tcH7KT0HtE/Vorr-F5rjaI/AAAAAAAABg4/DlKxfvilqdA/s400/20150922_105231.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br />Back to modern day St Petersburg and added to all of the above were some cool cafes (Café Singer and Bolshe Kofe) and bars (Brew Craft Café) and some great vegetarian restaurants (Café Ukrop and Botanika) so you can see why I had a great time. Fortunately there is not enough space to tell you in detail about the night I was partying until dawn with a Finn, four Russian DXers and a bottle of cognac? <br /><br />Flights from the UK are reasonable (Manchester to St Petersburg via Frankfurt was £200 return, plus you need a visa) and a hotel such as the Hotel Russ is only around 40 Euros a night. Next September (9-12) the EDXC Conference is going to head west.<a href="https://edxcnews.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/edxc-2016-manchester-9-12-september-2016/"> To Manchester in fact where I would be the local organiser </a>on behalf of the <a href="http://bdxc.org.uk/">British DX Club</a>.

That's why we have planned a special 30th anniversary broadcast on the following days and times:<br /><br />3rd January 2016 from 08.00 to 16.00 UTC;<br />4th January 2026 from 13.00 to 16.00 UTC.<br /><br />Our frequency remains the same: 11390 kHz and power in the region of 30 watts. To mark this milestone, we?ll broadcast a special programme in Italian with details on the history of MRI and interviews with two well known DXers of Italy: Dario Monferini and Roberto Scaglione.<br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Also our playlist will have something special as only songs with the word "radio" in their title will be played (the playlist  includes also some little known tunes like ?Radio Tirana? by the Polish band Kult!).<br /><br />But that is not all. In addition to our weekly DX programme in English "Italian Shortwave Panorama" and "Studio DX", produced and presented by Roberto Scaglione, we'll be airing  two vintage MRI programmes:  a DX Show in English of 25th December 1991 hosted by a female speaker, as well as the edition nr. 6  of "Italian Wave", a programme aired during  1986, which featured new Italian bands playing different kinds of rock music.   <br /><br />As usual MRI encourages reception reports from listeners. Audio clips (mp3-file) of our broadcasts  are welcome!

Numbers stations and the covert operations that surround them have tried to maintain their secrecy for years, yet can now be accessed from the comfort of your armchair. True, you can?t decipher the coded information they transmit, but you can hear an audio file of a Numbers station, click to read what information has been amassed on it, including suspected origins and schedules, then click again to sometimes see a photo of the transmitter site.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Whether you missed last month?s introductory piece or not, the following paragraph will give you a flavour of where we?re at. It is from an old website in Florida that has long since disappeared into a black hole.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">?My first encounter with these mysteries was fairly innocuous. Time was when I would find an open carrier to see what might develop and just go to sleep with the radio on. One morning I awoke to hear the following transmission: ?5,4,1...8,7...8,3,2.. 9,1..?. My first reaction was one of utter bewilderment. The obvious question arose: Why is this mechanical-sounding female voice reading numbers? Had I discovered some sort of mechanized math exercise? A shuttle countdown gone completely awry? I had no idea. Intrigued, I continued to listen. Sure enough, they continued for about 10 minutes until...silence. There was no "end", no "fin", no fanfare, just radio silence.&nbsp; It took me a LOT of reading to find out that these transmissions were known as "Numbers Stations", alleged spy transmissions and one of the many ?Mysteries Of Radio?.&nbsp; Radio affords a lot of great opportunities for a variety of illicit broadcasting and traffic activity. It's fairly inexpensive. Almost everyone carries a radio in some parts of Europe, so spy activities don't appear unusual. Because of the great cloak of secrecy surrounding most of these operations, the lack of personnel on active duty at each location, and the ability to place a transmitter in the strangest of places, governments have a hard time in locating either the station or its operators. The numbers have been heard in languages, from Slavic to Chinese, but are most frequently in Spanish or English. They're usually announced by a female voice, thanks to a popular psychological study which found that people are more likely to listen to a female's voice than a man's. The voice is robotic, usually produced by voice synthesis (electronic simulation), although one particularly memorable instance was utter havoc- a supposedly drunken male was heard shouting numbers live on-air, with the sound of crashing, doors slamming, and other violent noises in the background?.<o:p></o:p></span></span></i></div><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Two experts in the cloak and dagger world of Numbers stations are Simon Mason and Chris Smolenski, both of whom have set up informative websites. Simon?s is in the U.K and Chris? in the U.S.A.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br />Chris Smolinski's ?Spy Centre - Spy Numbers Stations? is an ideal starting point, although personally I find some of the website layout confusing and hard to navigate, with certain features hidden away.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.spynumbers.com/">www.spynumbers.com</a> <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span lang="EN-US">However, there is plenty of incredible material amongst its pages.

Called ?Spooks?, you simply send an email to join, then sit back and read with intrigue as loggings come flooding in from monitors, and all aspects of the undercover world of espionage are discussed. There can be a lot of traffic, but you can always hit the trusty delete key if it gets too much, or unsubscribe.

The general consensus of the monitoring community was that it is a form of over-the-horizon radar. Two samples of ?The Razzer?

Some of them have expressed concern, however, in the U.S.A over the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) software called Carnivore, which is designed to monitor email. It is akin to the U.K Regulatory Powers bill that allows the powers that be to intercept emails via Internet Service Providers. The whole business of snooping on emails and Internet use is a contentious civil liberties one, which is closely related to the covert world of intelligence agencies and espionage. It is a topic often raised on the Spooks email list. For more information on Carnivore you can view a recorded video of a presentation by FBI agent Marcus Thomas, at <a href="http://videolab.uoregon.edu/nanog/carnivore/">http://videolab.uoregon.edu/nanog/carnivore/</a><o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">You can also get the F.B.I view at their Carnivore page<br /><a href="http://www.fbi.gov/programs/carnivore/carnivore.htm">http://www.fbi.gov/programs/carnivore/carnivore.htm</a><o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Or a more independent analysis at<br /><a href="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/carnivore-faq.html">http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/carnivore-faq.html</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Music for Anoraks<o:p></o:p></b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">There are at least two commercially available CDs of Numbers stations:<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In the U.K, The Conet Project was issued in 1997, and consists of recordings of 150 numbers stations dating from 1971.

Who actually prepares the material and reads the code into a microphone? Are they agents themselves or a handpicked, security-cleared team of government lackeys?

Two examples of old European stations conjure up images of the Cold War, but it shouldn?t be forgotten that the Numbers stations traffic is as busy as ever in 2001. The ?Drums and Trumpets? station (ENIGMA S2) is an inactive station whose transmissons peaked in 1989 and 1990. It broadcast in the Czech language, mostly on 4740, 5500 and 6675 KHz and it?s transmission format is poetically described thus:<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">?Imagine a scene at a military funeral when the lone trumpeter sounds "The Last Post" and you will&nbsp;have some idea of the musical signal sent by this Czech language number station. This plaintive bugle sounds about an hour before the transmission of the spy messages begins. Just before the actual message starts a different signal is sent. This is played with drums and trumpets and is a very up-tempo military marching tune similar to those played before the beginning of a battle. The woman then announces (in Czech) "Noma 12671, Gruppi 44; Noma 12671, Gruppi 44,&nbsp; and then goes into the five figure text, ending with the word "Krai".

Links and frequencies may be out of date- and it was written when broadband was in a minority of UK homes- but it may still an interesting read for some people ... Part 1 of 3.</span></div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Amidst the cacophony of sound on the short wave bands, a strange and mostly unexplained phenomenon has existed since early last century. On the non-broadcast bands, away from the ears of the average listener, there exists a mysterious set of transmissions. Tune in to certain frequencies on the fringes of the broadcast or utility bands at the top of the hour, and you won?t hear a station identification followed by a news bulletin as you might expect.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Instead, sometimes preceded with a signature tune or Interval Signal, but as often not, a voice will emerge, reading not a political opinion or sports results, but a series of numbers.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Welcome to the strange world of number stations. This is the first of a series of articles that will give you a flavour of what is probably the biggest mystery on the bands. This month there will be an introduction as to what you might be able to hear on your receivers, and explanations as to what they are assumed to be. Next month we?ll delve further into the field and show you ways to access all the information on numbers stations via Internet sites which have been set up by some of the many individuals and organisations who keep a tab on them. So there should be something for newcomers and Numbers stations veterans alike.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Some ascertain that numbers stations began during World War One as spy chiefs sent coded messages to their agents via radio. So what can you expect to hear at the dawn of the 21st century? The numbers stations are allegedly spy stations and consist of a series of random numbers being read out, in English, Spanish, German, Arabic and other languages, by men, women and sometimes even a child. (the latter being a station known as ?Swedish Rhapsody? consisting of a girl reading a list of numbers in German). Sometimes it is in morse code, sometimes just noise. One station has transmitted a continuous buzzing sound for years. Usually the voices are mechanised, sometimes they are read out live. This has led to tales of announcers who are the worse for drink slurring their numbers, and of a Spanish speaking numbers station being intermingled with Radio Habana, supposedly a give-away to the station?s location, or maybe a double bluff? As you would expect in such a sphere of mystery and suspicion, urban myths can spread, adding to a confusing and unquantifiable situation.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">If you have been listening to the short wave bands for years, you will undoubtedly have come across a numbers station at some point (also sometimes referred to as spy stations). When I first stumbled across them in the 1970s, I just assumed they were either weather beacons or just another form of the many squeaks, gurgling and static noises that you encounter, assuming them to serve a mundane purpose rather than anything sinister. I?m sure I am not alone in that assumption.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Newcomers to the radio hobby may think that such strange goings on, with numbers being transmitted in different languages across the ether, were a product of the cold war, (which many were), and would have long since faded away. However, over a decade after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the monotonous voices continue as regularly as ever. As well as messages from organisations such as the CIA, MI6, MOSSAD (the Israeli equivalent), some say there is activity in the field of industrial espionage too, with individuals working for transnational corporations maybe taking calculated risks to sell product information to a rival company.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The stations are basically broadcasting a secret code and at first sound or sight they appear to be a random set of numbers harking back to the realms of schoolboys secret agent games, days of home-made invisible ink made of lemons, and simple codes with numbers corresponding to a letter, decipherable within minutes.&nbsp; However, these broadcasts are assumed to be the work of government agencies, transmitting messages to agents in the field. Each agent is assigned what is called a one-time pad, a series of numbers, one copy for him and one for the transmitter base. Then the agent simply has to tune in to a frequency at the right time, note down the numbers being transmitted, and decipher the message.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In these days of highly developed and diverse forms of communications, the idea of a mechanised voice reading out codes which are to be received via a radio-set must appear incredibly old-fashioned. It is such a hit and miss affair after all, subject to propagation or interference from other signals on the bands. The agent the transmission is aimed at might not be at his receiver at the designated time, may incorrectly transcribe the code or just fail to hear it all. There is no way of knowing if the message has been received correctly.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So why not send an encrypted email, or a text message via phone, or use one of the many other forms of modern communication in this high-tech age? Well, the beauty in using short wave is there is no way of identifying the receiver, or the agent in the field. If you have the resources and the right government organisation behind you, it is easy to obtain details of emails or telephone messages that have been sent. Where telephone lines are monitored by the secret services certain patterns could emerge with a minimal amount of work. For instance, why does a telephone line rented by a plumber in a Johannesburg suburb receive a call originating from a State Office in Copenhagen lasting 20 minutes every third Thursday at 3.30 a.m? <o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So whilst broadcasters and utility band services, the regular users of short wave, increasingly look towards satellite and Internet to reach their audience, the spy scene continues to make use of a tried and tested medium. Messages are sent often and repeated, giving the recipient opportunity to ensure the message is correctly received.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Messages are transmitted by stations as regular as clockwork, day after day, year after year, and often consist of dummy messages. This is because were a station to transmit only when it had vital information to send, it would be easier to identify in times of crisis or political upheaval.&nbsp; An increase of traffic on the bands that coincided with a civil uprising in Bratislava could indicate that certain Numbers station frequencies were emanating from Slovakia.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Years of painstaking loggings and recordings by hobbyists has resulted in a highly developed network of monitors across the world, such as ENIGMA, which stands for the European Numbers Information and Monitoring Association, and is not to be confused with the Enigma code breaker machines used to such effect at Bletchley Park during World War II.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Officially the Numbers stations ?don?t exist?, but those who operate them are aware of&nbsp; the groups of radio hobbyists who listen in. They are probably considered a mostly harmless group that can be contained without any real threat to security. The proportion of the population that listen to short wave in the developed world is small, fewer still would listen to Numbers stations, and even fewer are likely to develop an interest in them. Even if a transmitter location is identified through piecing together loggings and signal strength, the codes themselves remain next to impossible to crack.&nbsp; Despite the coverft activities of operators, one unique station that transmits from what was Czechoslovakia, has actually verified a reception report by issuing a QSL card! Maybe this was an act of arrogance, or humour, as a simple acceptance of ?we know you know but so what??<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In 1997 The ?Conet Project? CD was issued. This is a 4 CD set of shortwave Numbers stations recordings assembled by enthusiasts, and gives a fascinating overview. They have a website which gives more information, but we?ll have a look at that next month. As well as giving all the information and links to Numbers stations that you would probably ever want, there is also an ongoing competition which invites you to try and crack the codes of various stations. I?ve reproduced one of them here as an example.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">This is a transcription of an E22 transmission, recorded on August 14th 1997, frequency 8024 lower side band.

When you consider the amount of airtime and column inches given over to ?unexplained? phenomena such as crop circles and UFOs, Numbers stations are never investigated to such depth, if at all, yet they can easily be heard by one and all with minimal effort and equipment but go unnoticed. <o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In 1999 The Daily Telegraph reported a spokesperson for the Department for Trade and Industry as saying the following about Numbers Stations: ?These are what you suppose they are. People shouldn't be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption?. This in itself is quite revealing.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Another rare piece of mainstream media exposure was when John Walters did a mainly light hearted report for the BBC 1 programme ?Here and Now? in April 1997. The most interesting quote came from ex-KGB Station Chief Oleg Gordieiski who stated ?The messages are a mixture of professional instruction, what to do next, and some personal messages from children, parents and friends. For example, Mr Gorbalov, next week please go to Vienna and use dead letterbox number 13. You will find 8,000 American dollars. It is your salary for the next month, and the rest for your operational expenses.?<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In an attempt for fellow hobbyists to identify them, Numbers Stations have been given nicknames by short wave listeners over the years, according to their output style or manner. For instance, two of the best known are run by British Intelligence Forces; The Lincolnshire Poacher and Cherry Ripe, and are named after their prelude tunes. ENIGMA made the identification process easier by assigning each station a designated number, to accompany the commonly used nickname.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Other details in the list include the suspected transmission site where known, description of the announcer (YL- Woman, OM- man), and the Intelligence Agency operating the station. <o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">ENIGMA designators, The following list illustrates some of the English speaking stations on the ENIGMA list.

I?ll take a look at a station known as ?the razzer? and an FBI agent?s view on a project named ?Carnivore?. There are various discussion groups, links to government bodies and sites, societies and clubs set up to discuss the subject and plenty of individual sites which range from the informative to the unbelievable.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp;(ENIGMA list with thanks to Ary Boender).<o:p></o:p></span><br /><pre><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></pre><pre><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></pre><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/feeds/3092526254080602740/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4372603247118502035&postID=3092526254080602740";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/3092526254080602740";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/3092526254080602740";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/2016/01/from-archives-numbers-station-game-part.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Chrissy Brand";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13644679705890329140";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:23;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4372603247118502035.post-803594664303098904";s:9:"published";s:29:"2015-12-31T11:49:00.002+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2015-12-31T11:49:31.850+00:00";s:5:"title";s:47:"The lights go out over parts of Europe tonight?";s:12:"atom_content";s:3364:"<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><img height="345" src="http://www.nostalgiastore.co.uk/files/208-1440.jpg" width="400" /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">?Or rather the audio, as medium wave (mw) bids adieu to the Radio France channels (Bleu, Info, Inter etc.) and Deutschlandfunk.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Luxy, good old Radio Luxembourg 208, or these days 1440kHz on mw. The transmitter at Marnach closes as this year ends. A special broadcast of the last Radio Luxembourg show -from the early 1990s- was aired again last night (0000 UTC 30 December). It was great to hear the Ovalteenies advert, a history of the proud old broadcaster that commenced its English programming back in the 1930s, rock and pop from the 1970s- which was when I used to listen under the bedclothes just like every other early radio-fan-soon-to-become- DXer!.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I even enjoyed China Radio International, also &nbsp;on 1440kHz, making the most of its pop and rock music show on their German language service.

(See Herman Boel's <a href="http://www.emwg.info/">European and North African MW Guide</a> for details- it's not being updated from now on but much of the info will be relevant for a few more months at least).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I certainly liked Kossuth Radio from Salt in Hungary on 540kHz earlier this month when it was booming in with news and sport and an enchanting children?s programme- the strongest signal from the Hungarian station that I?ve ever heard. That?s a good sign.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So, thanks to DLF and Radio France, and welcome to new mw DX adventures!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:162:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/feeds/803594664303098904/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4372603247118502035&postID=803594664303098904";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/803594664303098904";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4372603247118502035/posts/default/803594664303098904";s:4:"link";s:87:"http://dxinternational.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-lights-go-out-over-parts-of-europe.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Chrissy Brand";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13644679705890329140";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:24;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4372603247118502035.post-4699492795375686307";s:9:"published";s:29:"2015-11-02T14:53:00.001+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2015-11-02T14:53:14.160+00:00";s:5:"title";s:17:"Slovakia's backia";s:12:"atom_content";s:1078:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TdppobXI86k/Vjd4w9UcqnI/AAAAAAAABe8/rWgM3QmepAM/s1600/Radio%2BSlovakia%2BInternational%2B2015%2BQSL%2Bcard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TdppobXI86k/Vjd4w9UcqnI/AAAAAAAABe8/rWgM3QmepAM/s400/Radio%2BSlovakia%2BInternational%2B2015%2BQSL%2Bcard.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">2015 celebrates the 30th birthday of the iconic Slovak Radio building.
