Pop-up engineering by brilliant Matthew Reinhart. There is another video of the three working together. A treasure, no doubt, for Reinhart.<br /><br />A boy in his pajamas looks for his mommy and encounters monsters along the way. Each monster is accidentally tripped by the encounter with the boy until the last page where all the monsters are brought together in a chaotic pop-up tour de force at the moment the boy finds his mommy who turns out to be a bride of Frankenstein type.<br /><br />The book is complex with layered pop-up devices. While the idea of introducing individuals and bringing them together at the end has universal application. The same idea is used for the pop-up book, <i>Welcome to the Neighborwood</i>&nbsp;that I bought just now where individual woodland species are described to children and the final pop-up shows all the species together. That book <a href="https://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/welcome-to-neighborwood-pop-up-book-by.html">was shown here already</a> and it is simple in pop-up mechanics and art and design. But there are words. Whole paragraphs. So, it's a children's book to read with simple pop-up enhancement.<br /><br />The double doors that start off the book&nbsp;<i>Mommy?</i> took me twenty prototypes to figure out for the <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8536994938369051157#editor/target=post;postID=2792482422888786846;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=30;src=postname">Angry Monkey pop-up card</a>. By the end I returned to an earlier prototype and I didn't realize the art behind the doors is important as the doors themselves but I was too worn out and sick of the thing by then to draw an interior. The joke is, a couple on the sidewalk passes the doors. The girl says to the boy, "It's scientific fact that monkeys cannot turn a doorknob to open a door." The next page is a monkey flinging open the doors screaming, <b>"Lies!" </b>It was a cartoon that a British boy drew that put me in stitches. I copied his monkey. His arms are attached to the doors. The doors fling open his arms, not his arms fling the doors, but it looks like the same thing. I gave the card to my doctor and his nurse claimed it for herself. It was addressed to him, and she thanked me for sending her such a ridiculous laughable card. She was laughing when she thanked me.<br /><br />Look how rich the first page is. A strip underneath the artwork is attached to the right side near the central fold that pulls across the whole left side when the card opens but you cannot see any of that One door opens sympathetic to the card opening. The opposite door is tugged with an attachment that transfers energy the opposite direction. Stone steps form under the doors when the card is opened.<br /><br />Conversely, a V mechanism is set at a steep angle so one side is parallel with the central fold and instead of flipping both sides up it flips up only one side behind artwork and attached to new artwork so the mad science on the table appears to expand. But there are two such mechanisms along the central fold operating in opposite directions so the mad science art content attached to them &nbsp;top and bottom behind the original art content expands in both directions up and down. The right side page edge is the center fold for another internal card concealing art content and pop-up mechanisms. It operates as a separate card while its art contributes to the dungeon science lab composition. When opened the scientist spreads. At the same time a similar mechanism behind the artwork drops a vampire to appear in the opening of the drawn fireplace upside down like a bat. So, we have the clever storytelling of Sendak, the charming artwork Yorinks and the pop-up éclat of Reinhart. Sendak and Yorinks cannot do pop-ups, and Reinhart is not any good at story telling and poor at art. Together the three make one big fat genius. Truly, the best of the best. And each page shows this same excellence.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mommy-pop-up-book-Maurice-Sendak/dp/0439880505/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516617498&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mommy%3F">This book is so cheap on Amazon it makes me ill</a>. I paid over twice this and I considered it a bargain. I should buy half a dozen copies and give them away. I just might do that.<br /><br />Several videos of this book on YouTube to show you. I'll have you know that I spared you the video of the woman showing off her deplorable lime green fingernails that she uses to scratch the surface of the book. Why she would do that, show off those disgusting fingernails and emphasize their annoyance in fingernails on chalkboard style, is beyond me. I hated her in two seconds flat and got out of there fast as I could. &nbsp;I picked this video because a child is enjoying it. When little kids read it just blows my mind. They're so precious.

There are eight shows. The series follows Newfoundland fishermen in small short squat shrimp boats with the two long side rigging arrangements for double rig shrimp trawling. But they catch other species. The crew are dissimilar to the American crab fishing crews, and they're not like the British fishermen on similar television shows. They're more gentle in nature, their swears are Christian, and they're goofier, frankly. Their boats are ill equipped. There is no redundancy on board or anywhere throughout the show, they sail by the seat of their pants, they take too many unnecessary risks, their equipment continuously fails, to the point that the viewer (me) loses sympathy. We expect all technical things to fail. Ropes and netting are continuously becoming entangled in the prop so often that one wonders why there is no protection for the prop. Floats get stuck in the barrel that rolls up the net. Wenches get stuck and thousands of pounds of fish must be scooped out by hand, engines fail constantly, even a simple roller gets chewed through by its cable and there is no replacement on board so the boat must return. Expensive halibut is lost overboard as it's being loaded with gaffs, losing $1,500 in one single fail during an incredibly tight three-day season. <br /><br />Knowing nothing about what's going on, their failures are easily predictable. Their plans are poorly thought through. For example, the captain cleverly saves a portion of each catch, packages it and freezes it to sell on nearby Labrador where prices are three times higher but he must haul it there by ferry and then through veritable wilderness, miles and miles of zero civilization, no gas station, no telephone connection, nothing, just them, their truck and their flatbed trailer. No road service whatsoever. And that calls for doubling of preparation but they do not do it. The captain must borrow a home-freezer from his grandmother but he never returns things. He takes it. It's beat up. It's dirty and scratched and in worse shape than an item in a garage sale. One of his items of fish, scallops, I think, must be kept frozen hard. The rest of haul can be on ice. The captain's solution is a generator.<br /><br />Sitting at home the viewer (me) predicts generator failure. There is no back up generator. It must fail. And his biggest payoff must be ruined. I prepare myself to sneer and mock when it does. Along the way the trailer has a flat. No spare for the trailer. The generator does fail. Their trip is reduced to a crawl, they drag into the small town with sparks flying from their load pushing down the axle onto the road. They park at the edge of town in a space just off the road and make a few sales right off. They get money exchanged immediately. Word spreads through the whole town in mere minutes and the entire town shows up en mass to make purchases of frozen seafood at their triple prices. They very quickly sell their product with enough money for repairs. So the trip is a success. It really is a great idea. Still very poorly thought through and with zero preparation beyond the initial idea, so a string of unnecessary difficulties turning a pleasant trip into an ordeal fraught with uncertainty. The whole thing could have gone much smoother with proper updated equipment and with just a bit of redundancy on critical parts, and with tools. But no. They sail, drive, and fly by the seat of their pants.<br /><br />As boys do.<br /><br />I like this show a lot. It's fun to watch and see how the other half lives. But it's frustrating as it is charming. The people are backward as much as they're lovely. This last episode, #8 for season 3, a woman sets back feminism by at least five decades. She's on a boat with men. So there is equality right there. There is a small boat approaching. The boats generator dies and the woman waiting to connect bends in half and buries her face in her hands at her knees in fear and frustration. Not the reaction needed for this emergency situation. The narrator describes fear among sailors, and fire is the worst of their fears. The scene is shot at night, the approaching boat's generator that stopped then bursts into flames. The woman's voice rises four octaves to siren pitch and she utters sounds that are not language. The men race around the woman self-assembling to save the life of the incoming fisherman. I thought the imperiled fisherman was her husband judging by her reaction, but he's not. He's another of their crew. There is a 5 gallon gas tank on the small boat near the burning generator. There is no place for the fisherman to go. The water is ice cold. The woman continues screeching very high pitched sounds but she doesn't do anything to help the men. She has no idea how to be any help while the men figure out how to handle this situation. Instead, one of the men must now comfort the woman. So one less man to assist as he comforts the crying distraught woman. She buries her head in his shoulder. She became a screaming child in the face of adversity and the men had to rescue the fisherman.<br /><br />I realize these are different cultures, but they're not so opposite our own. We speak the same language, they have access to the same technology. We had just had women's marches across the entire United States and beyond of women wearing pussy hats demanding equal pay for equal jobs along with other grievances, mostly pure resistance for the sake of it. And here is a job where the women are actually working with men. The men take care of the fire, save the fisherman's life, save the small boat, resolve the emergency situation, the result of poor planning no doubt, and the woman screams like a banshee and behaves exactly like an infant child.<br /><br />I love women. I respect women. But this woman on this show represents women poorly.<br /><br />I recommend this show. I think you'll find it interesting. It's a good peek into a similar yet significantly different culture.<br /><br />Fakeout. They put cowboys in the title and that's an American thing. The nearest equivalent is Argentine gaucho. There isn't a cow to be seen. Not even a seacow. But they do rustle up fish. I must say, inefficiently, from American perspective.";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/7965493579426675205/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=7965493579426675205";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/7965493579426675205";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/7965493579426675205";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/cold-water-cowboys.html";s:11:"author_name";s:9:"Chip Ahoy";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:2;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-1634121391998521552";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-21T18:00:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-21T18:00:23.755-05:00";s:5:"title";s:27:"When I moved to Nebraska...";s:12:"atom_content";s:1153:"...I first heard the phrase "If you don't like the weather just wait five minutes."<br /><br />And while I never found that to be true, changeability in the weather is a fact of life.

Featuring pussy hats to commemorate the first anniversary of first march organized for the inauguration day of Donald Trump. The woman's march is as much Anti-Trump as it is anything else. The speeches were vehemently, wildly, anti-Trump including Madonna saying she'd like to bomb the White House. The organization is about resistance to Trump. Resistance to any and all things Tump, actual events, actual speeches, actual tweets notwithstanding. It doesn't matter what Trump says or accomplishes. They're against it. Their movement is defined by Trump.<br /><br />A commenter said, "Hope Trump tweets something positive about oxygen so we can watch them all suffocate."<br /><br />I glanced at a few signs held by women in the march in Denver covered by local news as I was turning it off, and the three signs were incoherent. Vague and vapid statements. "We take pride in our resistance."<br /><br />Well, look at you. Somebody should who's not me.<br /><br />Knowing the (global?) marches are about himself, Trump trolled them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bq4A9IlgdXA/WmTq2ObyzMI/AAAAAAAAYh4/D8JMAE8LWFk3q5J4RU6b69BzYsxqIRymwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-01-21%2Bat%2B12.32.09%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="324" data-original-width="524" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bq4A9IlgdXA/WmTq2ObyzMI/AAAAAAAAYh4/D8JMAE8LWFk3q5J4RU6b69BzYsxqIRymwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-01-21%2Bat%2B12.32.09%2BPM.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Precisely what we've come to expect.

Think about that one.<br /><br />The economy is humming along. Here is an interesting fact. <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/01/has-trump-set-up-an-economic-boom.php">Less educated workers are seeing the biggest increase in their salaries</a>. Both in take home because of the tax cuts and in higher salaries because they don't have to compete with illegals. This effects not just the white working class but blacks and Hispanics as well.&nbsp; Who do you think a black factory worker is going to support. President Trump with his swaggering ways and the raises in his paycheck or Elizabeth Warren or some other old white lady. Or a weeping homo like Cory Booker. Somehow I think he can get a big slice of the black vote. The black male vote. Maybe not anywhere close to 50%, but if he gets close to 25% it flips a whole bunch of states.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Still and all I predict he will not run for reelection. I think he will leave such a solid record of achievement that he would step down and not worry about it secure that his place in history is solid despite what the liars in the media say. Especially if he gets the Wall completed or at least mostly completed. He can retire at the top of his game. The way he did from the Celebrity Apprentice. He can turn it over to the next generation.<br /><br />But who will be his successor?<br /><br />Vice President Pence has the inside track of course. But he is not exactly a political dynamo. The contrast of his more phlegmatic personality does have its appeal but I think that it will go in a different direction.<br /><br />I think the next President will be&nbsp; Tom Cotton.<br /><br />I have been a supporter of Senator Cotton for a while. He is the polar opposite of pussies like Ben Sasse and Lady Lindsey Graham. In fact he just bitch slapped Lady Graham. President Trump had Senator Cotton and Congressman Goodlatte in the meeting and has said there is no deal unless they sign on. Sign on to border enforcement, E-Verify and the Wall. Otherwise no deal. Tom Cotton is&nbsp; President Trumps natural heir. On Immigration. On defense matters. On standing up to the Democrats and bitch slapping the media and the cucks like Lady Graham.<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/19/tom-cotton-fires-back-american-people-want-trumps-vision-of-immigration-policy-not-lindsey-grahams/"> Here is what Senator Cotton had to say about Lady Graham after he tried to diss him by comparing him to immigration hawk Steve King:</a><br /><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #111111; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #111111; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">"The difference between Steve King and Lindsey Graham is that Steve King can actually win an election in Iowa.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #111111; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Look, we had an election in 2016.

Confirm Conservative Judges. Cut regulations. Build the Keystone pipeline. Drill the ANWAR reserves. Open up grazing and land use in the Government lands that make up so much of the western states. Get out of the Paris climate accords. Recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Destroy ISIS. Cut taxes. Especially corporate taxes so these greedy corps would repatriate monies hidden over seas. Increase investment in American Manufacturing. Standing up for religious freedom and the unborn. But for some reason these so called "conservatives" could not get this done. Unexpectedly.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I remember how a couple of our posters kept telling me that the God Emperor was really a New York Liberal and he was just lying about what he was going to do. How he would cut deals with Schumer and Pelosi and we would be in the same boat as if we elected Hillary. How did that work out?</div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The God Emperor has proven all of his critics wrong. He has been by far the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan. In fact I think he has been the most conservative since Calvin Coolidge. The phony conservative intelligentsia and consultants still&nbsp; hate him and undermine him at every turn. They pretend to like what he is doing but deplore his tone. His tweets. His speeches to the crowds of cheering peasants who they would never have in their homes. His hair. His two scoops of ice cream and his ketchup on his steak. Quislings and traitors like Jonah Goldberg, Bill Kristol, John McCain, Jeff Flake, Lady Graham and George Will all had their rice bowls destroyed. They are laughing stocks. Irrelevant. Jokes.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Two examples leap to mind.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">First the March for Life. President Trump addressed the multitudes. He reaffirmed his support of the Right to Life. He appointed Judges who will eventually reverse or at least modify Roe to take into account science and how viable a baby is in the womb. Other politicians like the Bushes gave lip service to the Right to Life. President Trump has stood firm.&nbsp; His recent promulgation of regulations that would exempt health care professionals from having to deal with abortion or even the phony sex change bullshit serves as a fierce rebuke to those douches who said there was nothing we could do about it. Who surrender to the liberal politically correct policies without a fight. Morons wonder why a sinner like the God Emperor who has a lot of bad stuff in his past can get the support of the Evangelical community and conservative Catholics like me. Well we remember that Jesus forgave the whores and the tax collectors. It is what you do going forward that counts not what you did in the past. The libs just can't understand this. They are just morons and Philistines.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Second is the government shut down. The Dems thought that the God Emperor would surrender on immigration and give them everything they want without any border enforcement. Without the Wall. You know the way that faggots like Bush and super faggots like Lady Graham are demanding. To give amnesty to illegals with nothing in return. They thought that the God Emperor would betray the people they way they do as a matter of course. But as another famous faggot said "Surprise, Surprise, Surprise." The God Emperor is holding true to the covenant that he made with his supporters. Even in the face of a government shut down. If that shatters the rice bowls of millions of government drones so much the better. They just can't believe it. They thought he would fold. All the right people in all the right conversations at all the right parties said he would. Not gonna happen assholes.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I just hope that he doesn't just break their rice bowls. I hope he grinds them into dust. Drives them out of the public square. Make an end to them once and for all.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Because they are truly the enemy of the American people. Of the normals like you and me.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">All Hail the Emperor of the Cherry Blossom Throne!!!!!!!!!!!!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0cphBXeE1pM/WmO8EulNGjI/AAAAAAAAeVQ/l1r-lKcPwVshTn47K-LP8b1YIaXbxBEmgCLcBGAs/s1600/emperor%2Btrump.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="469" data-original-width="387" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0cphBXeE1pM/WmO8EulNGjI/AAAAAAAAeVQ/l1r-lKcPwVshTn47K-LP8b1YIaXbxBEmgCLcBGAs/s320/emperor%2Btrump.png" width="264" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><span id="goog_921300855"></span><span id="goog_921300856"></span>";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/2405880378785975665/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=2405880378785975665";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/2405880378785975665";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/2405880378785975665";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-conservative-establishment-is.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Trooper York";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/01978703998566102194";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:13;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-7382947679275385446";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-20T16:30:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-20T16:30:32.506-05:00";s:5:"title";s:14:"Deplorable Vet";s:12:"atom_content";s:1724:"This obviously deplorable person will take Maxine Water's place at Trump's State of the Union address.<br /><br />I like this picture a lot. <a href="https://legalinsurrection.com/2018/01/veteran-upset-at-dems-boycotting-trump-state-of-the-union-address-invited-to-attend/#more-239901">Full story at Legal Insurrection</a>.<br /><br />See, Maxine Walters makes a name for herself in her miserable world by her flouncing and protests and weirdly distorted delusions.

All the videos posted there yesterday are very good and well worth your while to watch. That way you can be the smarty pants at the party dance. Or if not, then be blissfully unaware like everyone else you run into at this imagined place.<br /><br />This post is about the contents put up yesterday on another website, The Conservative Treehouse, the Last Refuge.<br /><br />The treehouse is on fire.<br /><br />For months on end, a full year actually, the authors there (I presume more than one that post under one name, but I'm not certain) have been promising revelation by explosion and readers are weary of waiting without seeing results, and now we finally see the embers catch on. So much is happening right now it's nearly impossible to keep up and have the various threads pulled out of entanglement and kept straight. But first a question.<br /><br />When you're asked the philosophical question, if a tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it, does it make a sound? And the philosophical answer is no because by definition sound requires an ear to perceive sound waves. Look it up. The definition says sound is heard. Its how the question is posed. Should have asked, does it make those waves in the air that could be perceived as sound? Or, does a worm in the ground nearby still feel the vibrations? Or, is a bird's nest in the tree disrupted? Yes, the tree produces sound waves whether or not there is an ear to hear it, and whether that ear is hearing or deaf, whether or not the hard of hearing receptors have their hearing aids turned on.<br /><br />Well, now the whole forest of trees has fallen and Democrat party is resolutely willingly deaf to the sound of it, and American media takes all of their cues from Democrat party. So the sound must have to blast through them.<br /><br />Sundance first posts "<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/the-evidence-inside-the-house-intel-committee-four-page-fisa-memo/">The Evidence Inside the House Intel Committee four page FISA memo</a>" ... Where he explains why Nunes produced the memo. The reason is because of the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility that is housed by departments. Each compartment knows its own bit but does not have access to the other compartments. This memo consolidates the salient information that each compartment owns and provides a summation of the whole picture of corruption that runs through the FBI and DOJ under Obama. It shows how these departments were weaponized to use FISA courts to spy on the Trump campaign and to produce false evidence to destroy it. To destroy Trump. Worse, and even more serious for themselves, if Trump was elected then he'd have access to information about all that they did. And now that has actually happened. The memo takes a highly classified set of documents and consolidates them into one 4-paged document that is still classified but less, so that Congress men and women can all view them. Then, the idea is have President Trump to declassify the entire set of documents and presented for public view.<br /><br />As you know Watergate was about a break-in to Democrat party headquarters to steal information, and Nixon was impeached and forced into retirement because he learned of it later and hid information about the crime and he lied about what he knew. And now there is evidence that Democrat party and government departments committed crimes against Trump and Republican party and went to extremes of corruption to hide it. What is being revealed is several magnitudes of order greater than Watergate and far more damaging. And there is so much irony loaded into every single step at every level involving every &nbsp;principal that it isn't even possible to list them all. That Hillary Clinton was kicked off the Watergate commission for being too outrageously viciously wild in her attacks and is now central to her own similar crime in producing the dossier and central to its concealment is only one such insane irony to ponder.<br /><br />Sundance elaborates t<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/03/29/understanding-the-nunes-paradox/">he Nunes paradox</a>.<br /><br />Because the web of deceit is so complex, Sundance continuously reviews his graphic of principals working together interdepartmentally and with parties outside of government, and adds to them as they're revealed. He reprints his list of crucial turning points. He continuously reminds his readers of areas already covered at length so they see how new information fits into it. Or else his readers would not be able to follow. The whole thing becomes a bizarre mash of names and titles and departments and positions.<br /><br />Nunes created the memo as first step in exposing the full documents, to make documents classified top secret available to the public. This memo is available to Congress but they must go into a room to read it and so far all Democrat congressmen and women have refused to even look at it. Instead they create a distraction of shutting down government so that event is covered by their corrupted media instead. But this is too big. This will burst through their distraction.<br /><br />After Congress approves it for release then President Trump must approve it. Nobody doubts that he will.<br /><br />There is even talk about Trump possibly revealing key elements himself during his State of Union speech and then media will be forced to confront it.<br /><br />Then Sundance uploads this video in the title.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Az53n_eFXg" width="525"></iframe></div><br />Then an item about <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/president-trump-signs-2018-fisa-authorization-with-changes/">Trump signing 2018 FISA Authorization</a> with changes that prevent departments from doing the things that they did to Trump. This fairly well shows that Trump knows all about the details discussed at the treehouse. And knowing that makes you wonder why Trump doesn't tweet about that. And then you realize Trump is actually judicious in his tweets, even the ones that media and Democrats and GOPe claim are insane. Imagine knowing all this, and more, and just sitting there waiting for it to run its slow course, for the various forces arrayed against him to exhaust themselves. Watching these videos of Congressmen tell what they can at this point make you realize Trump is holding back to an extraordinary extent. Where he could lash out like Hitler and Stalin and a spoiled baby as he's been described.<br /><br />Then a video of <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-matt-gaetz-discusses-releasethememo-laws-were-broken/">Representative Matt Gaetz (R, Fla)</a> discussing the memo: "laws were broken" ... &nbsp;Sundance reiterates that by presenting a "less classified" summary of the contents of the "extremely classified" documentary evidence that has been protecting criminal activity in DOJ and FBI he is setting it up for opposition to question its validity. If Democrats attack the four-page memo then Nunes will request the Speaker of the House to declassify all of the underlying evidence, breaking the Compartmented Intelligence restriction. If Democrats dismiss the summary memo then they should support exposing the underlying evidence the memo was built on.<br /><br />Then, yet another related video <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-jim-jordan-discusses-releasethememo-fisa-abuse-and-doj-fbi-corruption/">Representative Jim Jordan discusses #releasethememo - FISA abuse and DOJ/FBI corruption.</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There have been daily revelations showing a considerable collaboration between the White House, Hillary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson; his wife Mary Jacoby, DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr and his wife Fusion GPS employee Nellie Ohr, Russian Dossier author Christopher Steele, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page; and the highest levels of officials within the FBI, including Chief Legal Counsel James Baker and FBI Asst. Director Andrew McCabe.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">All of the evidence points in one transparently obvious direction; toward a 2016 collaborative effort structured to use a counterintelligence operation to conduct wiretaps and surveillance on the presidential campaign of candidate Donald Trump.&nbsp;</blockquote>Ten of those words in this quote have links to deeper pages. A very good deal of information for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Finally, to end the day, yet another video of<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/tucker-carlson-interviews-donald-trump-jr-and-matt-gaetz/"> Tucker Carlson interviewing Donald Trump Jr. and Matt Gaetz ...&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;about the FISA summary memo and their plan to have the incredibly damaging classified information exposed. This is a very good video that I'm certain you'll value for several reasons including observing Trump Jr.'s stoic equanimity in the face of outrageous treatment. He compares time spent on this nonsense with time spent on Hillary's astounding handling of Benghazi. <br /><br />But wait. There's more.<br /><br />It's been a great day at the treehouse. There are two more videos unrelated to Nune's FISA memo that make America great.<br /><br />OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Press Briefing on Schumer Shutdown.<br /><br />And President Trump and Vice President Pence addressing the March for Life audience from the Rose Garden.<br /><br />And as always, comments number in the hundreds to each post and they're all worth your time reading.";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/6085865364600409153/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=6085865364600409153";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/6085865364600409153";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/6085865364600409153";s:4:"link";s:89:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/representative-ron-de-santis-r-fla.html";s:11:"author_name";s:9:"Chip Ahoy";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:17;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-1898627258548302667";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-20T01:05:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-20T01:05:27.293-05:00";s:5:"title";s:17:"Where's my water?";s:12:"atom_content";s:1641:"Last night I was practicing interpreting a newsreader on video and came to the word "cartoon" and nothing came out of me automatically.

(Egyptian paintings are cartoons, outlines filled with color fields) I looked up the word, thinking it should be "shape" or "outline" "flat colorful drawing," something like that. The dictionaries show the sign for "funny."<br /><br />I don't like that.<br /><br />Not all cartoons are funny. And the idea doesn't always refer to newspaper funny pages or comic section.<br /><br />Sometimes you just have to live with these shortcomings.<br /><br />While results for [cartoon, asl] continue with all sorts of ridiculous vaguely related things. Cartoon in written experimental asl, marks for common hand shapes. Cartoon drawn by deaf people. Cartoons about sign language. &nbsp;Like this. This is so stupid I laughed for five minutes. By an Australian guy who explains a few magic tricks on his channel through the use of poorly drawn cartoons. This one is different and it doesn't appear on his channel. It's the "left it" portion that just kills me. This rebus style can not work because it creates more questions (about puns in English) than it answers (where is my water). <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zfa1mHj2NsI" width="525"></iframe></div><br /><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/1898627258548302667/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=1898627258548302667";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/1898627258548302667";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/1898627258548302667";s:4:"link";s:70:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/wheres-my-water.html";s:11:"author_name";s:9:"Chip Ahoy";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:18;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-5061427781674017559";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-19T21:15:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-19T21:15:07.182-05:00";s:5:"title";s:8:"Sonority";s:12:"atom_content";s:507:"<div style="text-align: center;">Get Bach.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Every type of olive available at the olive bar, to imitate bulb decorations. While the copy is all the same drab green olives from a jar. Or a tin. I don't care for olives myself, so I'm not the best judge, but I'm good enough to know there is no comparison in taste. The ones in jars and tins are anemic compared to the olives marketed carefully. I learned that by making <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/2009/05/olive-penguins.html">olive penguins</a> for Deena's party. I tasted a few out of a jar from the supermarket and compared them with a few from the olive bar at Whole Foods and although I don't like either one, the difference in quality exceeds 100%. They're probably twice as expensive but they're probably four or five times better. I could understand what they're supposed to be.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-food-fails-expectations-vs-reality/?page_numb=1">The page says 25+ examples</a>, but they mean 25 pages of examples, not 25 fails. The collection of food-fails goes on forever. The examples devolve into cake and cupcake fails and those are funny but less interesting. There is also a site for that, <a href="http://www.cakewrecks.com/">Cake Wrecks</a>, but that site shows only professional fails, they don't make fun of individuals trying to do something artistic. While having no mercy on pros.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I don't make cakes. Except this one birthday cake.

But honestly, I just don't care for cake.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Although I admit, yesterday I made a cheese soufflé in a jar. Whipped the egg whites in a glass jar then folded the béchamel thickened further with the four egg yolks into that along with two types of cheese. Then poured that into a small baking bowl. And that turned out great. And it got me thinking about doing the same thing except with a chocolate cake. I liked the idea of making an individual size. Such as they do with a tin can.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another of the failures listed is Halloween cookie fingers, and as God is my witness, I invented those over twenty years ago. For work. And my first try was a failure as shown on the fail page. But I learned from that first batch from the oven to add flour to the remainder of my peanut butter dough to stiffen it up. They still tasted like peanut butter but weaker than the usual peanut butter cookie. I learned to shape the knuckles by pushing both ends of the cookie worms to form a bulge in the middle. Then tap the bulge four times with a dinner knife to create wrinkles in the knuckle bulge. I learned to form the fingernail by pressing down flat with a dinner knife on the edge to shape cuticle and a flat surface for an icing fingernail. Then use the same knife to place icing flavored with almond extract to harden and form a fingernail. And color the same icing with red to dip the opposite ends for bloody stumps and allow it to drip back over the finger. And reserve some of the white icing to place a white dot on top of the red at the end for a chopped bone. Then I went throughout the entire bank as I did everyday but this time leaving cookie fingers in people's desks along side their pens, on their desks, in their pen cups, on the paper cutters by the copier machines, under the lid that you lift on the copiers all over the bank. On all the desks of my favorite secretaries, in the mail room by the electric letter opener, By electric pencil sharpeners. Everywhere people would find them one-by-one, and when I started hearing shrieks here and there I knew my plan came to its fruition. Those peanut butter fingers were a gigantic hit that Halloween and eventually people figured out on their own that I was responsible. And they saved them. They saved their stupid fingers. I had to talk them into eating them by promising to replace them. People came to my desk asking if I have any extra peanut butter fingers. Then everyone who did eat one started nibbling the fingernail. As if biting their own fingernail. That unexpected behavior was hilarious. They were very convincing fingers. Nothing at all like the ones shown on the fail page. And that whole idea came about because someone told me to bring finger food. So I did.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After fifty years of steaming rice, I'm only just now steaming it without rinsing first. In Tokyo our housekeeper taught me Japanese rice must be rinsed seven times. And to do that ritualistically and watch for the water to clear. So I followed her instructions for decades. Until two weeks ago. For sticky rice. I like it sticky. It's easier to eat with chopsticks. It can be colored brown like that for the bear with nearly anything. Like soy sauce. I think I could do this bear. But why?&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I made <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=rice+omelet">rice omelets before</a>, and they're very good, but never in the shape of a bear.

This person isn't even trying. I made them before and they always came out very good, <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=pretzels">if a little too fat</a>. This is where I learned to make mustard from powdered mustard. Originally I thought I had to have mustard seeds, and maybe that's best, but it's not necessary. I didn't know how much vinegar to use so I decided to use my own judgement, how much vinegar I wanted to go with that much powder, then continued adding water until the desired viscosity was reached.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You would not believe how fantastic this mustard is until you try it yourself. It's fierce the day that you make it and becomes less fierce as it is stored. Everyone who has tasted it agrees, it's the best mustard they've ever tasted. I used rice vinegar because that is my favorite but I imagine any vinegar will work just as well. Only three ingredients, mustard powder, vinegar, and water, boom, the best mustard you'll ever have. Since then, I buy multiple of mustard powder in tins. I buy it by the sack full from Whole Foods economy bins. There is simply no point in buying prepared mustard anymore. All the mustard manufacturers do the same thing. And they buy their mustard seeds from us. Even the French do. They do have their boutique mustard fields, but the United States and Canada supply most the world's mustard seeds. And all they do is add vinegar and water. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I put a pile of pretzels in a bag into my backpack and took them into a nearby shop and announced "I have come bearing gifts." That got their attention. Opened the backpack and whipped out the pretzels. The young clerks are always starving. They snatched one each and bit into them. I was reaching into my backpack just as one of them said, "All we need now is mustard." Ta-daa. Right at that moment I produced mustard out of the backpack. It was brilliant magic right there from their point of view. Think it, and there it is, just like that. As bread, the pretzels were well received. Fat, poorly formed pretzels. With chunky sea salt glistening on them.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">These chile pepper dogs below look pretty good. And you can see where the failures went wrong. The hotdogs have grill marks on them and the chiles do not. The whole point is to grill and blister the chiles while the hot dogs inside pre-stuffed with cheese warm up as the chiles blister on the grill. It's a very good idea that eliminates the useless foam-like white bread. Each hot dog takes two jalapeños with the membrane scrapped out.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">One time a friend said "The chile heat is in the seeds." Something he heard. He's an intellectual type who does not like being contradicted. So I go, "Let's test." I carefully separated a few seeds from the membrane even the tiny bit that connects it, and put a few seeds in my mouth. He did the same. They are inert. While the tiny thread that connects them has heat. And the membrane that contains them is loaded with heat. To calm them down and make these hotdogs bearable, then remove all of the membrane inside. And that's easier to do when both ends are trimmed this severely. Don't they look good?</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l4Kp4BjdRR8/WmG8yQSnggI/AAAAAAAAYhQ/-JEcAPjHJ34gIfCIfjoN-udlzERCGumCwCLcBGAs/s1600/expectations%2Breality%2B1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1037" data-original-width="605" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l4Kp4BjdRR8/WmG8yQSnggI/AAAAAAAAYhQ/-JEcAPjHJ34gIfCIfjoN-udlzERCGumCwCLcBGAs/s1600/expectations%2Breality%2B1.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The failures are pathetic.

It was made ten years ago. Possibly eleven. The photo hosting companies have changed ownership, and changed their own policies and practices so much the photos were nearly impossible to find. Finally I gave up looking in all the places they could be reasonably and asked Duckduckgo directly with my user name&nbsp;+ chia and under images tab I was shown the photos except the last critical one. They are not shown in Google search. They're uploaded to Wordpress, most confusing, a site that I never uploaded to. I did not create that account. And the addresses for the photos is an album that I never created. I have no idea what happened to my originals, nor how these were saved, server to server, nor anything about what happened to all the other few hundred photos in the alien album where these were salvaged, although they're all mine. So I'm uploading them again here because I like them. I went to a lot of trouble putting little fur coats on these Chia pets. An Alpaca gave its skin for these coats. For this religious joke.

That will get me to the road, which, as those of you who live in snow country understand is another set of problems. Has the road been plowed? Did the plow push an impenetrable mound of snow across the end of the driveway? Can you bust through that?

A friend and I walk our dogs on a quiet nearby street, and up at the top of the hill is a former hospice - now closed to patients. While walking by it one day I saw Saint Francis, broken in two, lying in the brush. I got the sense that vandals had taken him from the grounds and dashed him against the hillside. After finishing the walk I came back and picked him up - he was broken clean in two, and once I applied some super strength outdoor masonry epoxy and mashed him back together he was as good as new. Now he lives in a bower, under a dogwood tree where I can see him out my kitchen window. He reminds me that kindness to animals is an important part of life. Thanks, Frankie, you da man.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85bxliCEbZE">Updated, because who doesn't like the Pre-Raphaelites?</a></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:167:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/135698225401917064/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=135698225401917064";s:9:"link_edit";s:80:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/135698225401917064";s:9:"link_self";s:80:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/135698225401917064";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/tales-from-snowpacalypse.html";s:11:"author_name";s:10:"Sixty Grit";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:23;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-7060458227612976531";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-18T04:00:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-18T04:00:01.617-05:00";s:5:"title";s:25:"WKRLEM: Sock it to Racism";s:12:"atom_content";s:125:"<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHyGW7KBfdM" width="480"></iframe>";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/7060458227612976531/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=7060458227612976531";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/7060458227612976531";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/7060458227612976531";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/wkrlem-sock-it-to-racism.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Trooper York";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/01978703998566102194";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:24;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-2786886460719925752";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-18T02:00:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-18T02:00:15.983-05:00";s:5:"title";s:60:"WEB MD VIDEO: Exclusive video of the God Emperor's physical!";s:12:"atom_content";s:931:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m-RSmC8r7QY/WmAnsO2YDjI/AAAAAAAAeUs/fsQroTa0vDMQAKcgJ-At9P-yBt__zVsGACLcBGAs/s1600/FAT%2BBASTARD.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="404" data-original-width="720" height="179" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m-RSmC8r7QY/WmAnsO2YDjI/AAAAAAAAeUs/fsQroTa0vDMQAKcgJ-At9P-yBt__zVsGACLcBGAs/s320/FAT%2BBASTARD.gif" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Or maybe it is video's of his date with Stormy Daniels.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Hey do you think all of those people who got a $1,000 bonus care about this?</div><br /><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/feeds/2786886460719925752/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=717986195212622043&postID=2786886460719925752";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/2786886460719925752";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/717986195212622043/posts/default/2786886460719925752";s:4:"link";s:90:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/web-md-video-exclusive-video-of-god.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Trooper York";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/01978703998566102194";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}}s:7:"channel";a:13:{s:2:"id";s:44:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-22T07:13:34.732-05:00";s:5:"title";s:12:"Lem's Levity";s:8:"subtitle";s:172:"?A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, ?You are mad; you are not like us.'? ?
