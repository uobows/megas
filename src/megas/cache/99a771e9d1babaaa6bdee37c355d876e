<p>With Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples representing 3 per cent of the population, the number should be closer to 500. But Indigenous architects make up just 0.2 per cent of the roughly 12,000 architects in Australia today.</p>
<p>This gap is the target of a new scholarship fund to support Indigenous architecture students like Marni Reti, now in her fourth year of architecture at UTS and the only Indigenous student in her class.</p>
<p>The Droga Indigenous Architecture Scholarship has been made possible with a $1 million donation from cultural philanthropists the Droga Family Foundation. With additional support from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the aim is to eventually support up to 10 Indigenous students a year in their studies with UTS?s <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-design-architecture-and-building/what-we-do/architecture">School of Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>The scholarship follows on from the Droga <a href="http://foundation.architecture.com.au/">Architect in Residence</a> program Daniel and Lyndell Droga launched in 2014 in partnership with the Australian Institute of Architecture, which has the aim of providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism and design.</p>
<p>?We wanted to build on the success of the residency and, in particular, understand Indigenous participation in architecture in Australia ? and these hard facts [on Indigenous representation] were revealed in our research,? says Daniel Droga.</p>

<p>?We?re all thrilled to be involved in working towards meaningful change for Indigenous participation in Australian architecture,? Daniel Droga says.</p>
<p>The Drogas? donation is the largest single donation to the education of Indigenous architects in Australia.</p>
<p>The goal is to support up to six undergraduate and up to four postgraduate architecture scholarships each year. The awardees will also be mentored by the industry, with the Government Architect NSW and the NSW Architects Registration Board supporting the initiative as the first industry partners,</p>
<p>Professor Michael McDaniel, UTS?s Pro Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Leadership and Engagement, and Director of the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, says Indigenous architects have the potential to make a valuable contribution ?not only to their communities but to society as a whole, by bringing architectural skills and knowledge together with an understanding of culture, community and environment?.</p>
<p>UTS will support the Droga scholarships through Jumbunna, which includes the Galuwa Experience program introducing Indigenous high school students to a broad range of higher education opportunities, such as architecture.</p>
<p>UTS Professor of Architecture Anthony Burke says the perspective and knowledge of Indigenous architects is needed not just in Indigenous or remote communities but in urban spaces too.</p>
<p>?There?s an enormous, untapped wealth of Indigenous knowledge that has never made it across the threshold into architectural practice or environmental design,? he says. ?An Indigenous perspective on architecture is a real source of inspiration and a resource for us as a discipline.?</p>
<p>He hopes that by starting to build Indigenous representation in Australian architecture, yet more Indigenous people will be inspired to join the profession.</p>
<p>Student Marni Reti, who grew up on ?The Block? in Sydney?s Redfern, hopes to use her skills in her local community ? an urban environment where she wants to bring an Indigenous perspective and give local communities a voice.</p>
<p>Indigenous architects have a wealth of knowledge about country and land, and how to create a space that is specific to Australia, she says.</p>
<p>The Droga program aims to award the first two scholarships to commence in 2019.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><span id="part1">Bitcoin. Depending on who you listen to, it's set to totally disrupt the world's financial markets, or it's a pyramid scheme waiting to take us all down. Either way, it's hard to go past the eye-watering returns it's produced over the last 12 months ? we all know someone who's now swimming in a tub of early-investor bitcoin-driven cash, right? </span></p>
<p><span id="part1">But if you're thinking about throwing your hard-earned money into the bitcoin void, it's smart to know a bit about where it's going. Here are five things you need to know about this world-changing ? and hugely volatile ? cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="part1"><strong>1.</strong>       <strong>It's been a wild ride</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="part1">Once upon a time, bitcoin was something that nerds talked about ? until it wasn't. Its meteoric rise over the last 12 months has made it a daily conversation staple, even among people who normally spend their time bitching about the price of Sydney real estate instead. Here's what happened: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/900-20000-bitcoins-historic-2017-price-run-revisited/" target="_blank">In December 2016, bitcoin was trading at around $900. A year later, it hit a peak of nearly $20,000.</a> Great news, right? Fast forward to January 2018, only a month after its record highs, and bitcoin bottomed out, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">dropping to below $10,000</a>. While it's recovered somewhat (today, it's trading at about $14,000), the currency's peaks and troughs have always been volatile, based partly on its finite supply (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins released</a>) ? but that seems to be part of the appeal.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="part1"><strong>2.</strong>       <strong>Bitcoin's the icing, blockchain's the cake</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="part1">If you're going to invest in bitcoin, you should probably know a little bit about blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Essentially, blockchain is a digital ledger that records bitcoin transactions via a decentralised computer network. When a bitcoin transaction is made, blockchain provides a report to the network about the results, adding the new block of encrypted, verified data to the existing chain of information contained within the ledger (clear as mud? Read this <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank">beginner's guide to blockchain</a>). The lure of blockchain is that it's been designed to be incorruptible ? information can't be removed or erased from the chain after it's added, and blockchain has a built-in consensus protocol that basically prevents dodgy bastards from coming in and hacking the system. In short, it solves problems of trust, reputation and transparency ? three key areas of risk when it comes to online transactions. What's more, blockchain can do much more than just verify bitcoin transactions ? in future, it has the potential to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/11/21/smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-businesses-reap-the-benefits/#4bf28a3d1074" target="_blank">deliver smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/11/17/what-is-blockchain-used-for-besides-bitcoin/#4bdd1666446e" target="_blank">prevent voter fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/24/blockchain-bitcoin-technology-most-important-tech-invention-of-our-age-sir-mark-walport" target="_blank">issue passports and record land registries, to name a few.  </a></span></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><span id="part1">Bitcoin. Depending on who you listen to, it's set to totally disrupt the world's financial markets, or it's a pyramid scheme waiting to take us all down. Either way, it's hard to go past the eye-watering returns it's produced over the last 12 months ? we all know someone who's now swimming in a tub of early-investor bitcoin-driven cash, right? </span></p>
<p><span id="part1">But if you're thinking about throwing your hard-earned money into the bitcoin void, it's smart to know a bit about where it's going. Here are five things you need to know about this world-changing ? and hugely volatile ? cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="part1"><strong>1.</strong>       <strong>It's been a wild ride</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="part1">Once upon a time, bitcoin was something that nerds talked about ? until it wasn't. Its meteoric rise over the last 12 months has made it a daily conversation staple, even among people who normally spend their time bitching about the price of Sydney real estate instead. Here's what happened: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/900-20000-bitcoins-historic-2017-price-run-revisited/" target="_blank">In December 2016, bitcoin was trading at around $900. A year later, it hit a peak of nearly $20,000.</a> Great news, right? Fast forward to January 2018, only a month after its record highs, and bitcoin bottomed out, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">dropping to below $10,000</a>. While it's recovered somewhat (today, it's trading at about $14,000), the currency's peaks and troughs have always been volatile, based partly on its finite supply (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins released</a>) ? but that seems to be part of the appeal.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="part1"><strong>2.</strong>       <strong>Bitcoin's the icing, blockchain's the cake</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="part1">If you're going to invest in bitcoin, you should probably know a little bit about blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Essentially, blockchain is a digital ledger that records bitcoin transactions via a decentralised computer network. When a bitcoin transaction is made, blockchain provides a report to the network about the results, adding the new block of encrypted, verified data to the existing chain of information contained within the ledger (clear as mud? Read this <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank">beginner's guide to blockchain</a>). The lure of blockchain is that it's been designed to be incorruptible ? information can't be removed or erased from the chain after it's added, and blockchain has a built-in consensus protocol that basically prevents dodgy bastards from coming in and hacking the system. In short, it solves problems of trust, reputation and transparency ? three key areas of risk when it comes to online transactions. What's more, blockchain can do much more than just verify bitcoin transactions ? in future, it has the potential to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/11/21/smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-businesses-reap-the-benefits/#4bf28a3d1074" target="_blank">deliver smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/11/17/what-is-blockchain-used-for-besides-bitcoin/#4bdd1666446e" target="_blank">prevent voter fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/24/blockchain-bitcoin-technology-most-important-tech-invention-of-our-age-sir-mark-walport" target="_blank">issue passports and record land registries, to name a few.  </a></span></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">To improve cities, governments are increasingly promoting the use of technology and data-driven decision-making. They decide how technologies and Big Data are being used or deployed in creating smart cities, with the help of academics who collect and interpret data, design new city ideas and newer technologies for cities.</p>
<p>Data harnessed from networked objects that citizens wear or use daily can ease our lives. But it?s possible that the uses of Big Data jeopardise citizens, such as in the scenarios we present below.</p>
<h2>1. Longer commute for low-class workers</h2>
<p>Imagine this: A traffic system manages a city?s rush hour, handling thousands of traffic lights, public transport commutes and pedestrian signals. Meanwhile, an AI system uses real-time data drawn from hundreds of thousands of sensors on vehicles and buses. With help from infrastructure like light poles, the optimal flow of traffic is calculated based on the number of vehicles and people in the system.</p>
<p>Reducing commute times and improving productivity is the stated end goal of city governments. Who could argue with that?</p>
<p>But linking traffic data, geographic data and economic performance creates another scenario. If the system increases economic performance, is it any wonder it prioritises higher-paying jobs linked to more expensive suburbs neighbouring the city?</p>
<p>Low-paid commuters contribute less financially to a city?s economy, so a highly paid executive getting a quicker ride to work makes brutal sense. But the system introduces a bias: public transport suddenly takes a little longer for a clerical worker.</p>
<h2>2. Park bench meter?</h2>
<p>The humble park bench presents another ethical dilemma for city planners. We?ve been paying for car parking in cities for decades. Now that we can live-track people in fine detail, the possibility of micro-charging for public amenities creates an opportunity for new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Think about paying a few cents for time spent resting on a park bench ? a parking meter for people. This obviously discourages the positive attributes of city living for avid park users.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/210705/original/file-20180316-104645-skvrol.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">In the future, will we have to pay to sit on a park bench?</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source"><a href="http://www.shutterstock.com">www.shutterstock.com</a></span></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yet, as an example of ?data-driven? governance, it plausibly shines a light on the already feasible potential for economic disparity.</p>
<h2>3. Health and the consent of citizens</h2>
<p>Big Data can also be used to inform city design and planning to reduce health disparities. Public surveillance systems can connect geo-data with health services data to attend to populations that need urgent help.</p>
<p>But there are major ethical challenges that centre on fears about the privacy of information that is provided. The perception that data will be paternally used in targeted community interventions is also an issue.</p>
<p>At the Indonesian-Australian Digital Forum in Jakarta in January, participants analysed the sustainability of using citizen reports to collect data on malaria. This information sharing can potentially benefit communities by targeting public health services in areas of need.</p>
<p>But it also creates stigma and privacy concerns when individuals are known within their community as disease carriers. Is there any opportunity to consider a person?s consent?</p>
<p>Big Data certainly creates opportunities to reduce health disparities. But how many benevolent government interventions engage targeted citizens in the development process?</p>
<h2>Focusing on the citizen</h2>
<p>The examples we use above are very near-term realities. The possibilities and problems of Big Data mean designers require a new type of intelligence that exists between technology and the humanities.</p>
<p>As technologies become more sophisticated the designer holds a key role in customising such concepts for mass use. Additionally, as the pendulum swings from technological solutions towards the citizen?s experiences, the variations in different countries? political and cultural systems will become more pronounced. The old adage that ?all politics is local? will be reinforced.</p>
<p>But in a Big Data environment, the tendency to average out all those local specificities is magnified by generic technology approaches to complex cultural and contextual problems.</p>
<p>Governments should think about and resolve ethical questions in the design of smart cities. City planners should ensure that the technologies deployed do not take away citizens? privacy and that personal data are not used against them.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">To improve cities, governments are increasingly promoting the use of technology and data-driven decision-making. They decide how technologies and Big Data are being used or deployed in creating smart cities, with the help of academics who collect and interpret data, design new city ideas and newer technologies for cities.</p>
<p>Data harnessed from networked objects that citizens wear or use daily can ease our lives. But it?s possible that the uses of Big Data jeopardise citizens, such as in the scenarios we present below.</p>
<h2>1. Longer commute for low-class workers</h2>
<p>Imagine this: A traffic system manages a city?s rush hour, handling thousands of traffic lights, public transport commutes and pedestrian signals. Meanwhile, an AI system uses real-time data drawn from hundreds of thousands of sensors on vehicles and buses. With help from infrastructure like light poles, the optimal flow of traffic is calculated based on the number of vehicles and people in the system.</p>
<p>Reducing commute times and improving productivity is the stated end goal of city governments. Who could argue with that?</p>
<p>But linking traffic data, geographic data and economic performance creates another scenario. If the system increases economic performance, is it any wonder it prioritises higher-paying jobs linked to more expensive suburbs neighbouring the city?</p>
<p>Low-paid commuters contribute less financially to a city?s economy, so a highly paid executive getting a quicker ride to work makes brutal sense. But the system introduces a bias: public transport suddenly takes a little longer for a clerical worker.</p>
<h2>2. Park bench meter?</h2>
<p>The humble park bench presents another ethical dilemma for city planners. We?ve been paying for car parking in cities for decades. Now that we can live-track people in fine detail, the possibility of micro-charging for public amenities creates an opportunity for new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Think about paying a few cents for time spent resting on a park bench ? a parking meter for people. This obviously discourages the positive attributes of city living for avid park users.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/210705/original/file-20180316-104645-skvrol.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">In the future, will we have to pay to sit on a park bench?</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source"><a href="http://www.shutterstock.com">www.shutterstock.com</a></span></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yet, as an example of ?data-driven? governance, it plausibly shines a light on the already feasible potential for economic disparity.</p>
<h2>3. Health and the consent of citizens</h2>
<p>Big Data can also be used to inform city design and planning to reduce health disparities. Public surveillance systems can connect geo-data with health services data to attend to populations that need urgent help.</p>
<p>But there are major ethical challenges that centre on fears about the privacy of information that is provided. The perception that data will be paternally used in targeted community interventions is also an issue.</p>
<p>At the Indonesian-Australian Digital Forum in Jakarta in January, participants analysed the sustainability of using citizen reports to collect data on malaria. This information sharing can potentially benefit communities by targeting public health services in areas of need.</p>
<p>But it also creates stigma and privacy concerns when individuals are known within their community as disease carriers. Is there any opportunity to consider a person?s consent?</p>
<p>Big Data certainly creates opportunities to reduce health disparities. But how many benevolent government interventions engage targeted citizens in the development process?</p>
<h2>Focusing on the citizen</h2>
<p>The examples we use above are very near-term realities. The possibilities and problems of Big Data mean designers require a new type of intelligence that exists between technology and the humanities.</p>
<p>As technologies become more sophisticated the designer holds a key role in customising such concepts for mass use. Additionally, as the pendulum swings from technological solutions towards the citizen?s experiences, the variations in different countries? political and cultural systems will become more pronounced. The old adage that ?all politics is local? will be reinforced.</p>
<p>But in a Big Data environment, the tendency to average out all those local specificities is magnified by generic technology approaches to complex cultural and contextual problems.</p>
<p>Governments should think about and resolve ethical questions in the design of smart cities. City planners should ensure that the technologies deployed do not take away citizens? privacy and that personal data are not used against them.</p>

<p>So how seriously should we take these issues? And where is the line between healthy and unhealthy use of social media?</p>
<h2>Social media can be good for well-being</h2>
<p>The inherent potential of social media is that it allows us to connect. We keep in touch with family and friends, reach out to favourite brands, share our views and feelings with the world, and stay up-to-date with news and events.</p>
<p>Some people go further and use social media for self-development and empowering others. In 2014 and 2015 we <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/23/3/467/2909006">interviewed 25 ovarian cancer patients</a>, followed by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23702/full">a survey of another 150</a> to ascertain the impact of specialised social media groups on patients. We learned that some cancer patients use moderated Facebook groups to share information and experiences with like-minded people, which considerably improved their psychological well-being.</p>

<h2>Adverse impacts</h2>
<p>We also conducted an extensive <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24015/full">review of past studies</a> on the impacts of social media applications on users, and discovered various negative effects. These include feelings of stress, depression, jealousy and loneliness, as well as reduced self-esteem and life satisfaction, and violations of privacy and safety.</p>
<p>We found that while some users are conscious of developing negative feelings through using particular social media platforms, others may be unaware of such adverse effects until their psychological health deteriorates. These negative experiences can hurt our well-being, and in some cases may lead to extreme consequences, such as harming others or suicide.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">As Manager of the UTS Peer Assisted Study Success (U:PASS) program, Georgina Barratt-See wanted to know if it was really making a difference to student success. With 10 years of data to analyse she didn?t know where to begin. That?s where postgraduate student Len Tay and the Master of Data Science and Innovation?s subject iLab came in ? upskilling staff in data literacy while empowering students to work with real clients.</p>
<p><strong>Georgina Barratt-See</strong></p>
<p>We have 110 high-achieving and compassionate leaders running study sessions with students, mainly in first-year subjects. We know peer-based work is much more effective as the students see the peer leaders as just another student.</p>
<p>When I heard the Master of Data Science and Innovation had a subject giving master?s students projects to look at real industry data, I instantly wanted to know more. I've been doing my job for a very long time now ? almost 10 years ? and we compile a lot of individual data sets each session and perform a lot of evaluation. We look at how often students come to classes, the types of students that attend, their opinion of U:PASS, that kind of thing. But, there was no linkage of that data.</p>
<p>I don?t have the ability or time to look at our data in-depth and I always thought it would make a good research project. This was a great chance to look at the big picture results, like how the different subjects are performing and which ones we could work on. I put together a proposal and next thing I knew I had an email from Len telling me she had selected my project.</p>
<p>We instantly connected. Working with a student can be hard because you spend so much time teaching them what needs to be done. But Len just ?got it?, instantly. I immediately saw how intelligent she is.</p>
<p>If you meet Len she's just so calm and thoughtful. I'm kind of extroverted and passionate, so this pairing between us just worked.</p>
<p>I gave Len so much data and thought, 'She's not going to cope with this?. But she was able to unpick all the questions we were asking from a data perspective. As the project progressed, she clarified, probed and asked good questions.</p>
<p>We?re already seeing the benefits of this data project. I was approached by an associate dean asking for data from their particular faculty. I pulled out some of Len's data and explained what we'd discovered over the semesters and how we could see the different patterns across the subjects. It was great. </p>
<p>Working with Len was really rewarding and easy. I hope to stay in touch with Len and I like to think I?ve helped her in her new data scientist career.</p>
<p><strong>Len Tay</strong></p>
<p>I?ve been working in computer science for close to 20 years and have seen a lot of things we?re doing in the field already being outsourced. That?s why I decided to go back to university and study the Master of Data Science and Innovation. It?s a degree for students who?d like to become experts in data science.</p>
<p>I was attracted to the degree because it pointed to the future ? I wanted to move into something that I can see being ?alive? in years to come. Plus, I really like writing algorithms. I like doing programming. I like analysing data.</p>
<p>I met Georgina through iLab 1 ? it?s a subject that requires students to team-up with real clients to analyse their data. Out of a list of possible projects, both at UTS and in industry, I chose Georgina?s U:PASS project because I wanted to do something in student analysis. I?m a student myself, and my two kids study at UTS. I was curious to see what sort of experience students are having on campus. And the U:PASS data could tell me that.</p>
<p>I knew from the start that we?d work really well together. Georgina is a very open and helpful person and was flexible with how we worked. That?s a big thing. I?ve met other clients who are very demanding but Georgina wasn?t. She was very respectful of my time.</p>
<p>Georgina?s more of a morning person and I prefer to work at night, so we?d just email back and forth. I?d say I spent a total of 50 or 60 hours mining the data over about three months.</p>
<p>Georgina was also very clear on her objectives. Some clients just give you the data and ask you to find correlations and patterns, but Georgina is smart and knew what she wanted to ask of it: which are the best performing subjects? Which are the worst performing subjects? If a student stops attending U:PASS will they still continue to improve or not? Essentially, what?s the mark, if any, that U:PASS leaves on the student?s learning.</p>
<p>Before the project, I wasn?t sure if I could do data science confidently on my own. But working through it gave me enough confidence to say, ?Yep, I know what I?m doing?.</p>
<p>I think Georgina was surprised with what data can do. Or better, what we can do with data. When we started she was wary of handing over hundreds of thousands of records; like it was too much for me. But, I smiled and said, ?Don?t worry, the programming language can handle it?. Plus, data analysis gives me a kick! To be able to answer the questions people have, that gives me so much satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>So, what did the data tell us?</strong></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">One in four Australian children aged eight to 14 experiences online bullying. Yet, most victims and witnesses stay silent, compounding the impact on mental health. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) experts are teaming up with community and industry organisations to tackle the problem in all its stages.</p>
<p>Xue Li?s youngest daughter was just 10 years old when he walked in on her typing intensely on the family computer, causing her to cover the screen.</p>
<p>?I was a little surprised because I used to know everything my daughter was doing ? I took her to school. Suddenly I felt a bit strange,? says Xue, a Professor in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>On learning his daughter was using social media, Xue?s first concern was that she might be talking to strangers. Yet, when she told him she was chatting with her school friends, his unease remained. Xue began searching Google for information on cyberbullying.</p>
<p>?There were dozens of photos of children, some as young as my daughter, who had committed suicide because of cyberbullying. Most of them were bullied by their classmates, their school mates, their close friends, actually.?</p>
<p>Xue resolved to do something to protect children from such ?bad, ugly? experiences. So he set out to develop software to detect, and ultimately prevent, cyberbullying behaviour.</p>
<p>To begin with, one of Xue?s PhD students compiled a data set, manually tagging what did and didn?t constitute cyberbullying and suicide ideation. The information would be used to train a machine how to recognise the behaviours. But, Xue needed sponsorship to continue the project, so he approached researchers at UTS to collaborate in attracting an industry partner.</p>
<p>?UTS has a very strong research team in machine learning ? one of the best in Australia,? says Xue. ?And this is basically a machine learning, AI project.?</p>
<p>Fortuitously, when Xue made contact in 2014, researchers at the UTS Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) were already ?exploring how our research could be applied to social networks to benefit society,? says Senior Lecturer Guodong Long.</p>
<p>Led by CAI?s Professor Ivor Tsang, along with Xue, Guodong and Adjunct Professor Dacheng Tao, the team proposed to change existing cyberbullying prevention services from reactive keyword filtering to proactive early detection.</p>
<p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div id="file-30756" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">

</div>
<p>In 2015, they secured $550,000 through the Australian Research Council?s Linkage scheme, which supports research partnerships with business, industry and community organisations. This enabled the researchers to collaborate with the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) and the Global Business College of Australia (GBCA), bringing both additional expertise and partner funding to the project.</p>
<p>And the research evolved as a result. In addition to detecting cyberbullying, the team is now developing an automation tool to assist social workers and other support people to conduct effective conversations about cyberbullying with youth.</p>
<p>Director of Collaboration and Engagement at ARACY Kristy Noble says, ?Because this pervasive digital world we live in is such a new thing, we don't know much about how these technologies impact child and youth mental health.?</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?By collaborating, we bring out expertise in all areas to facilitate the best possible outcomes.?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>While public discourse often focuses on the negative effects of digital technologies on young people, Kristy says we need to ask, ?How can we utilise them as a positive tool, such as through the delivery of online cognitive behavioural therapy??</p>
<p>By leveraging ARACY?s expertise in evidence-based approaches to child health and wellbeing, the team are looking to develop practical, preventative solutions.</p>
<p>?Sometimes it is hard for social workers and parents to convince children not to bully or to help them if they have been bullied,? explains Guodong. ?We are trying to develop a new technology that can help you rank your sentence when you say something or type something.</p>
<p>?This software can tell you if your words are suitable for the situation or how much impact they can have.?</p>
<p>Having used publicly available data to inform the detection model, the team are now grappling with the personal privacy aspect of the research. Guodong explains, ?We want people to feel safe and comfortable that when they use our software their personal information will not be available to others as part of a big data set.?</p>
<p>Their solution was to develop a new piece of software that uses small data (accessible, easy-to-understand information) to preserve privacy. ?This software can be deployed to your mobile and the computations will happen ?within? your phone without extracting your data. So your personal information is protected.?  </p>
<p>It?s a complex project, requiring diverse expertise in cyberbullying, machine learning and AI, mental health and youth. So multidisciplinary and multi-sector collaboration are essential.</p>
<p>?We live in a world that is so full of expertise that no single person or organisation can really have the ability to provide the best of every aspect,? says Kristy. ?By collaborating, we bring out expertise in all areas to facilitate the best possible outcomes.?</p>
<p>From the researchers? perspective, the knowledge, networks and access to children?s and parents? perspectives that ARACY and GBCA have brought have been crucial to refining their ideas into workable solutions.</p>
<p>?Imagination is where it begins,? says Guodong, ?but to have comments from them helps us adapt our technology for the real world.?</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">One in four Australian children aged eight to 14 experiences online bullying. Yet, most victims and witnesses stay silent, compounding the impact on mental health. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) experts are teaming up with community and industry organisations to tackle the problem in all its stages.</p>
<p>Xue Li?s youngest daughter was just 10 years old when he walked in on her typing intensely on the family computer, causing her to cover the screen.</p>
<p>?I was a little surprised because I used to know everything my daughter was doing ? I took her to school. Suddenly I felt a bit strange,? says Xue, a Professor in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>On learning his daughter was using social media, Xue?s first concern was that she might be talking to strangers. Yet, when she told him she was chatting with her school friends, his unease remained. Xue began searching Google for information on cyberbullying.</p>
<p>?There were dozens of photos of children, some as young as my daughter, who had committed suicide because of cyberbullying. Most of them were bullied by their classmates, their school mates, their close friends, actually.?</p>
<p>Xue resolved to do something to protect children from such ?bad, ugly? experiences. So he set out to develop software to detect, and ultimately prevent, cyberbullying behaviour.</p>
<p>To begin with, one of Xue?s PhD students compiled a data set, manually tagging what did and didn?t constitute cyberbullying and suicide ideation. The information would be used to train a machine how to recognise the behaviours. But, Xue needed sponsorship to continue the project, so he approached researchers at UTS to collaborate in attracting an industry partner.</p>
<p>?UTS has a very strong research team in machine learning ? one of the best in Australia,? says Xue. ?And this is basically a machine learning, AI project.?</p>
<p>Fortuitously, when Xue made contact in 2014, researchers at the UTS Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) were already ?exploring how our research could be applied to social networks to benefit society,? says Senior Lecturer Guodong Long.</p>
<p>Led by CAI?s Professor Ivor Tsang, along with Xue, Guodong and Adjunct Professor Dacheng Tao, the team proposed to change existing cyberbullying prevention services from reactive keyword filtering to proactive early detection.</p>

</div>
<p>In 2015, they secured $550,000 through the Australian Research Council?s Linkage scheme, which supports research partnerships with business, industry and community organisations. This enabled the researchers to collaborate with the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) and the Global Business College of Australia (GBCA), bringing both additional expertise and partner funding to the project.</p>
<p>And the research evolved as a result. In addition to detecting cyberbullying, the team is now developing an automation tool to assist social workers and other support people to conduct effective conversations about cyberbullying with youth.</p>
<p>Director of Collaboration and Engagement at ARACY Kristy Noble says, ?Because this pervasive digital world we live in is such a new thing, we don't know much about how these technologies impact child and youth mental health.?</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?By collaborating, we bring out expertise in all areas to facilitate the best possible outcomes.?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>While public discourse often focuses on the negative effects of digital technologies on young people, Kristy says we need to ask, ?How can we utilise them as a positive tool, such as through the delivery of online cognitive behavioural therapy??</p>
<p>By leveraging ARACY?s expertise in evidence-based approaches to child health and wellbeing, the team are looking to develop practical, preventative solutions.</p>
<p>?Sometimes it is hard for social workers and parents to convince children not to bully or to help them if they have been bullied,? explains Guodong. ?We are trying to develop a new technology that can help you rank your sentence when you say something or type something.</p>
<p>?This software can tell you if your words are suitable for the situation or how much impact they can have.?</p>
<p>Having used publicly available data to inform the detection model, the team are now grappling with the personal privacy aspect of the research. Guodong explains, ?We want people to feel safe and comfortable that when they use our software their personal information will not be available to others as part of a big data set.?</p>
<p>Their solution was to develop a new piece of software that uses small data (accessible, easy-to-understand information) to preserve privacy. ?This software can be deployed to your mobile and the computations will happen ?within? your phone without extracting your data. So your personal information is protected.?  </p>
<p>It?s a complex project, requiring diverse expertise in cyberbullying, machine learning and AI, mental health and youth. So multidisciplinary and multi-sector collaboration are essential.</p>
<p>?We live in a world that is so full of expertise that no single person or organisation can really have the ability to provide the best of every aspect,? says Kristy. ?By collaborating, we bring out expertise in all areas to facilitate the best possible outcomes.?</p>
<p>From the researchers? perspective, the knowledge, networks and access to children?s and parents? perspectives that ARACY and GBCA have brought have been crucial to refining their ideas into workable solutions.</p>
<p>?Imagination is where it begins,? says Guodong, ?but to have comments from them helps us adapt our technology for the real world.?</p>

<hr /><p>Kate Scardifileld?s current exhibition <a href="http://art.uts.edu.au/index.php/exhibitions/soft-topologies/">Soft Topologies</a> at the UTS Gallery is an example of an artist using the metaphor of topology to make artwork and describe her practice. Scardifield?s primary media are textiles, though the exhibition is also a series of ?adaptable sculptures? that will be transformed by the artist and a select, multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>The exhibition is a choreography of Scardifield?s attractively coloured textiles, which spray, flutter, fan, drape, hang and crumple through the space like escaped gestures. These forms are only one version of the installations, limited by the static state convenient for gallery viewing.</p>

<h2>What is topology?</h2>
<p>The origins of topology are in the field of geometry, where it is used to understand ?<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-nobel-prize-for-physics-goes-to-topology-and-mathematicians-applaud-66532">geometric objects that don?t change when bent or stretched</a>.?</p>
<p>Combined with algebraic geometry, abstract algebra, differential equations and probabilities, topology is now used in many branches of physics to understand ?<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-nobel-prize-for-physics-goes-to-topology-and-mathematicians-applaud-66532">exotic states of matter</a>? - that is, states of matter that are not solid, liquid or gas and that have <a href="https://www.school-for-champions.com/science/matter_states_exotic.htm#.WpTm1BNuY6g">very unusual physical characteristics</a>.</p>
<p>But topology has recently made the transition from an exclusively mathematical field of study to something that is more widely used in the analysis and creation of cultural and social phenomena. Some scholars even claim that culture as a whole is ?<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276412454552">becoming topological</a>.?</p>

<p>Scardifield?s exhibition is an example of the way practitioners from different disciplines productively use ideas that originate in vastly different fields of study.</p>
<p>Metaphors forged in one discipline happily circulate through others. ?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory">The cell</a>?, for instance, is an architectural term that became common and influential in biological science, the study of social phenomena (terrorist cells) and technology (cell phone). ?Immunity? is a term that originally had <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ifAczQoHyZ0C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=1881+immune+metaphor+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjoxjJOi1X&amp;sig=6yOxSYMeeY22-Fv6Xw5rtKnN_kc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMyO7-q8fZAhVEvrwKHbXOC9oQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1881%20immune%20metaphor%20law&amp;f=false">legal applications</a> meaning ?exception from liability?, which is now more commonly associated with medicine.</p>

<h2>Explaining relationships</h2>
<p>Topology enables a different understanding of the relationships between things.</p>
<p>Philosopher <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/390243">Ian Hacking</a> suggests that the topological metaphor of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a> is an improvement on the optical metaphor of a spectrum for capturing our present awareness of autism. A spectrum ?misleadingly suggests a single dimension from severe to high-functioning? whereas manifolds, like kinds of autism, ?come in any number of dimensions?.</p>
<p>Topological metaphors are also useful for thinking differently about other relations that are conventionally conceived as spectra: left and right political, male and female gender.</p>
<p>For example, thinking topologically enables the understanding that Greens supporters and Nationals, who are usually imagined to be at opposed ends of the political spectrum, might be aligned on certain issues, such as those to do with the fights against coal mines on farm land.</p>

Accordion pleated spinnaker cloth, sail battens.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Robin Hearfield</span>, <span class="license">Author provided</span></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Topology in textiles</h2>
<p>Scardifield?s practice involves folding and distorting cloth so that it takes on a surprising variety of forms. She focuses on the relationship between change and continuity of form through operations of weaving, folding, draping, pleating and layering. These are analogous to the abstract manipulations and speculations that inform the mathematical field of topology.</p>
<p>A flat piece of cloth is a classic, simple two dimensional space. Three dimensional space of a more complicated nature is created when Scardifield deliberately folds cloth in pleats.</p>
<p>Folds of a more random variety are created in the exhibition by allowing the cloth to describe the forms of other objects (draping) or the forces of gravity and tension (hanging). The new forms created in these processes are at once distinct from and yet continuous with the original pieces of cloth.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/207989/original/file-20180227-36706-qzfdfm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Hand pleated and heat-set polyester organza, cotton thread, black tourmaline. 185x120cm (full expansion).

<p>Author and academic <a href="http://www.stevenconnor.com/topologies/">Steven Connor suggests</a> that ?the labile, intermediary form of the textile? provides a better material metaphor for understanding ?the contemporary world of communication and information? than previous alternatives of solidity or fluidity.</p>
<p>Textiles are at once pliable and cohesive, and in this sense invite the imagining of forms that dance with subtle fluctuations over time. This is expressed in the following video of Scardifield making a chevron mould.</p>
<script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script><script>
<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--
window.instgrm.Embeds.process()

</script><p>The expression of space and form in terms of continuity and change is central to the individual objects in Soft Topologies and the overall design of the exhibition. Scardifield has deliberately designed the exhibition as a dynamic space, involving multiple participants from different disciplines who rearrange her works for the duration of the show and express her textiles through other media, such as video and photography.</p>
<p>The traces of her work in different media are like the traces left by the folds Scardifield makes in cloth and paper to create new forms.</p>
<p>Scardifield doesn?t use topological mathematics in her exhibition. However, the show is a great example of topology can invite different possibilities for imagining and analysis.</p>

<p>Metaphors forged in one discipline happily circulate through others. ?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory">The cell</a>?, for instance, is an architectural term that became common and influential in biological science, the study of social phenomena (terrorist cells) and technology (cell phone). ?Immunity? is a term that originally had <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ifAczQoHyZ0C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=1881+immune+metaphor+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjoxjJOi1X&amp;sig=6yOxSYMeeY22-Fv6Xw5rtKnN_kc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMyO7-q8fZAhVEvrwKHbXOC9oQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1881%20immune%20metaphor%20law&amp;f=false">legal applications</a> meaning ?exception from liability?, which is now more commonly associated with medicine.</p>

<h2>Explaining relationships</h2>
<p>Topology enables a different understanding of the relationships between things.</p>
<p>Philosopher <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/390243">Ian Hacking</a> suggests that the topological metaphor of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a> is an improvement on the optical metaphor of a spectrum for capturing our present awareness of autism. A spectrum ?misleadingly suggests a single dimension from severe to high-functioning? whereas manifolds, like kinds of autism, ?come in any number of dimensions?.</p>
<p>Topological metaphors are also useful for thinking differently about other relations that are conventionally conceived as spectra: left and right political, male and female gender.</p>
<p>For example, thinking topologically enables the understanding that Greens supporters and Nationals, who are usually imagined to be at opposed ends of the political spectrum, might be aligned on certain issues, such as those to do with the fights against coal mines on farm land.</p>

<h2>Topology in textiles</h2>
<p>Scardifield?s practice involves folding and distorting cloth so that it takes on a surprising variety of forms. She focuses on the relationship between change and continuity of form through operations of weaving, folding, draping, pleating and layering. These are analogous to the abstract manipulations and speculations that inform the mathematical field of topology.</p>
<p>A flat piece of cloth is a classic, simple two dimensional space. Three dimensional space of a more complicated nature is created when Scardifield deliberately folds cloth in pleats.</p>
<p>Folds of a more random variety are created in the exhibition by allowing the cloth to describe the forms of other objects (draping) or the forces of gravity and tension (hanging). The new forms created in these processes are at once distinct from and yet continuous with the original pieces of cloth.</p>

<p>Author and academic <a href="http://www.stevenconnor.com/topologies/">Steven Connor suggests</a> that ?the labile, intermediary form of the textile? provides a better material metaphor for understanding ?the contemporary world of communication and information? than previous alternatives of solidity or fluidity.</p>
<p>Textiles are at once pliable and cohesive, and in this sense invite the imagining of forms that dance with subtle fluctuations over time. This is expressed in the following video of Scardifield making a chevron mould.</p>
<script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script><script>

</script><p>The expression of space and form in terms of continuity and change is central to the individual objects in Soft Topologies and the overall design of the exhibition. Scardifield has deliberately designed the exhibition as a dynamic space, involving multiple participants from different disciplines who rearrange her works for the duration of the show and express her textiles through other media, such as video and photography.</p>
<p>The traces of her work in different media are like the traces left by the folds Scardifield makes in cloth and paper to create new forms.</p>
<p>Scardifield doesn?t use topological mathematics in her exhibition. However, the show is a great example of topology can invite different possibilities for imagining and analysis.</p>

<p>The researchers, from UTS Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices (IBMD), believe this discovery removes an obstacle to further improvements in resolution and sensitivity in areas such as display technologies, security inks, and bio-imaging, with the potential to stimulate manufacturing innovations in Australia.</p>
<p>To overcome the quenching that dims the brightness of ultra-small nanoparticles, the UTS physicists developed a new type of nanoparticle called ?thermal dots?. By harvesting heat and thermal energy, and converting this energy to more light emissions, the researchers demonstrated a 1000 fold increase in the brightness of the nanoparticles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/dayong.jin">Professor Dayong Jin</a>, Director of IBMD, says that as the demand for smaller devices with more and more integrated functionalities grows, so too does the need for smaller and brighter ?building blocks? for these technologies.</p>
<p>?However nanoparticles have a ?tricky? surface layer that is very challenging to understand,? Professor Jin says.</p>
<p>?The smaller the nanoparticle the larger the surface area, and below 10nm the huge surface to volume ratio results in a dark layer that is optically inactive.</p>
<p>?We discovered that this dark layer is sensitive to temperature allowing us to find a new way to activate the intensity and prove that nanoparticles below 10nm can still efficiently fluoresce,? Professor Jin says.</p>
<p>Dr Zhou, who received funding for this project from the Australian Research Council as a DECRA Research Fellow, shows that the thermal dots can be used to make security inks for fraud detection and anti-counterfeiting applications.</p>
<p>?This discovery also highlights the potential for new types of nanosensors for early disease diagnosis, including highly sensitive nanothermometers that can provide a non-invasive way to answer many biological questions at the nanoscale, such as how cells develop and differentiate in cancer,? Dr Zhou says.</p>
<p>?The potential for this approach is very broad and could also be applied to significantly improve the efficiency of organic solar cell films and light displays that use micro LEDs.?</p>
