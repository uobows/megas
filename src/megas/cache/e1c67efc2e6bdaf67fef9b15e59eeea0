                </div><p><strong>A husband who murdered his estranged wife has been jailed for life as her tragic final words were read out to the court.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adan Dahir, 38, killed Asiyah Harris, 27, by stabbing her three times in the neck.</strong></p>
<p>Just before she died the mum-of-two was heard screaming: &#8220;Adan stop, leave me alone, get off me! Please, please Adan I love you, drop the knife please!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another witness told the court he heard the mum-of-two saying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t kill me, I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brutal attack was seen from the street by passersby as the former couple grappled in front of a window in the home they had shared in St Paul&#8217;s, Bristol.</p>
<p>Police had been called shortly before the murder to reports of a fight on August 21 at about 11pm.</p>
<p>Dahir spoke to police through a window and said there had been a fight between his ex-wife and his sister.</p>
<p>Asiyah confirmed the story, and the matter was thought to be sorted.</p>
<p>But just after midnight on August 22, neighbours heard more shouting.</p>
<p>When officers returned to the scene they found Asiyah lying in a pool of her own blood on the living room floor.</p>
<p>She had suffered two stab injuries to the neck, one to each side, and one of them severed an artery.</p>
<p>Paramedics were called but Asiyah was declared dead at the scene, and Dahir suggested to police she had caused the injuries to herself.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.faafiye.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_0765.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-1916" height="626" width="615" srcset="https://www.faafiye.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_0765.jpg 615w, https://www.faafiye.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_0765-295x300.jpg 295w, https://www.faafiye.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_0765-413x420.jpg 413w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>
<p>He told police that Asiyah brought the knife into the room and was trying to hit him with it.</p>
<p>He claimed he tried to pull the knife off her but she threw herself back, and he fell on top of her telling detectives: &#8220;That&#8217;s when the knife hit her neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dahir denied murder at the trial at Bristol Crown Court, but was convicted by a jury.</p>
<p>Asiyah and Dahir had separated some years before the murder and he had custody of the children.</p>
<p>But on the night of the killing the children were not in the house.</p>
<p>Dahir was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 16 years.</p>
<p>Judge Peter Blair QC said: &#8220;I have come to the inevitable conclusion that you intended to kill Asiyah. Today you will be sent to prison for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asiyah Harris was just 27 years old. We heard some lovely things said by her brother about her many talents.</p>
<p>A keen sportswoman, working as a translator.</p>
<p>&#8220;She bore you two children. Because of your murderous anger those children have lost their mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not know what the trigger was when you killed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senior Investigating Officer DCI Gary Haskins said: &#8220;Asiyah was a loving mother-of-two with her life ahead of her and her senseless murder has destroyed the lives of her family and friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asiyah was in the process of separating from Dahir and was living with family members in Bristol at the time of her death.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early hours of Tuesday August 22, Asiyah was inside her former home when she was brutally attacked by Dahir. During this attack she was stabbed three times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Witnesses saw the fatal attack through a window and were able to give compelling evidence in court which helped convict Dahir of murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sympathies are with Asiyah&#8217;s family as they continue to come to terms with their loss and we&#8217;d like to thank them for supporting our inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d also like to thank all the witnesses in this case and the local community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d also like to recognise the efforts of the officers who were first on the scene of this distressing incident and carried out first aid on Asiyah in very difficult and demanding circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asiyah&#8217;s brother Shyuab Harris, said: &#8220;As a family we are very happy with the verdict of guilty and the length of sentence imposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asiyah will be missed by all of those who knew her and we are devastated by the loss of our daughter, sister and mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her legacy will live on through her family and children.&#8221;</p>

                </div><p><strong>BANGKOK (AP) ? First, their villages were burned to the ground. Now, Myanmar?s government is using bulldozers to literally erase them from the earth ? in a vast operation rights groups say is destroying crucial evidence of mass atrocities against the nation?s ethnic Rohingya Muslim minority.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Satellite images of Myanmar?s troubled Rakhine state, released to The Associated Press by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe on Friday, show that dozens of empty villages and hamlets have been completely leveled by authorities in recent weeks ? far more than previously reported.</p>
<p>The villages were all set ablaze in the wake of violence last August, when a brutal clearance operation by security forces drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into exile in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>While Myanmar?s government claims it?s simply trying to rebuild a devastated region, the operation has raised deep concern among human rights advocates, who say the government is destroying what amounts to scores of crime scenes before any credible investigation takes place.</p>
<p>The operation has also horrified the Rohingya, who believe the government is intentionally eviscerating the dwindling remnants of their culture to make it nearly impossible for them to return.</p>
<p>One displaced Rohingya woman, whose village was among those razed, said she recently visited her former home in Myin Hlut and was</p>
<p>shocked by what she saw.</p>
<p>Most houses had been torched last year, but now, ?everything is gone, not even the trees are left,? the woman, named Zubairia, told AP by telephone. ?They just bulldozed everything &#8230; I could hardly recognize it.?</p>
<p>The 18-year-old said other homes in the same area that had been abandoned but not damaged were also flattened. ?All the memories that I had there are gone,? she said. ?They?ve been erased.?</p>
<p>Myanmar?s armed forces are accused not just of burning Muslim villages with the help of Buddhist mobs, but of carrying out massacres, rapes and widespread looting.</p>
<p>The latest crisis in Rakhine state began in August after Rohingya insurgents launched a series of unprecedented attacks on security posts.</p>
<p>Aerial photographs of leveled villages in northern Rakhine State were first made public Feb. 9 when the European Union?s ambassador to Myanmar, Kristian Schmidt, posted images taken from an aircraft of what he described as a ?vast bulldozed area? south of the town of Maungdaw.</p>
<p>Satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe indicates at least 28 villages or hamlets were leveled by bulldozers and other machinery in a 30-mile (50-kilometer) radius around Maungdaw between December and February; on some of the cleared areas, construction crews had erected new buildings or housing structures and helipads.</p>
<p>A similar analysis by Human Rights Watch on Friday said at least 55 villages have been affected so far.</p>
<p>The images offer an important window into what is effectively a part of Myanmar that is largely sealed off to the outside world. Myanmar bars independent media access to the state.</p>
<p>The government has spoken of plans to rebuild the region for months, and it has been busily expanding roads, repairing bridges, and constructing shelters, including dozens at a large transit camp at Taungpyo, near the Bangladesh border.</p>
<p>The camp opened in January to house returning refugees; but none have arrived and Rohingya have continued to flee.</p>
<p>Myint Khine, a government administrator in Maungdaw, said some of the new homes were intended for Muslims. But that does not appear to be the case for the majority of those built or planned so far, and many Rohingya fear authorities are seizing land they?ve lived on for generations.</p>
<p>One list, published by the government in December, indicated 787 houses would be constructed, most of them for Buddhists or Hindus. Only 22 of the houses were slated for ?Bengalis? ? the word Myanmar nationalists often use to describe the Rohingya, who they say are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Myint Khine said the government had no ulterior motive.</p>
<p>?Of course we have been using machines like earth removers and bulldozers because we have to clear the ground first before building new houses,? he said.</p>
<p>Chris Lewa, whose Arakan Project monitors the persecuted Muslim minority?s plight, said the degree to which the villages had been razed would make it even harder for the Rohingya, who have no citizenship and few rights, to ever reclaim their land.</p>
<p>?How will they identify where they lived, if nothing is left, if nothing can be recognized?? Lewa said. ?Their culture, their history, their past, their present ? it?s all being erased. When you see the pictures, it?s clear that whatever was left ? the mosques, the cemeteries, the homes ? they?re gone.?</p>
<p>Richard Weir, a Myanmar expert with Human Rights Watch, said on the images he had seen, ?there?s no more landmarks, there?s no trees, there?s no vegetation.?</p>
<p>?Everything is wiped away, and this is very concerning, because these are crime scenes,? he said. ?There?s been no credible investigation of these crimes. And so, what we?re talking about really is obstruction of justice.?</p>
<p>Both Weir and Lewa said no mass graves were known to have been destroyed. But, Weir added: ?We don?t know where all the graves are &#8230; because there is no access.?</p>
<p>Zubairia, who asked that only one of her names be used to protect her identify because she feared reprisals, said she did not believe any of the newly constructed homes were intended for Rohingya.</p>
<p>?Even if they give us small houses to live in, it will never be the same for us,? she said. ?How can we be happy about our houses being ripped off from our land??</p>
