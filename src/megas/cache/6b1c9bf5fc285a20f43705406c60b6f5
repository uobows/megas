There are eight shows. The series follows Newfoundland fishermen in small short squat shrimp boats with the two long side rigging arrangements for double rig shrimp trawling. But they catch other species. The crew are dissimilar to the American crab fishing crews, and they're not like the British fishermen on similar television shows. They're more gentle in nature, their swears are Christian, and they're goofier, frankly. Their boats are ill equipped. There is no redundancy on board or anywhere throughout the show, they sail by the seat of their pants, they take too many unnecessary risks, their equipment continuously fails, to the point that the viewer (me) loses sympathy. We expect all technical things to fail. Ropes and netting are continuously becoming entangled in the prop so often that one wonders why there is no protection for the prop. Floats get stuck in the barrel that rolls up the net. Wenches get stuck and thousands of pounds of fish must be scooped out by hand, engines fail constantly, even a simple roller gets chewed through by its cable and there is no replacement on board so the boat must return. Expensive halibut is lost overboard as it's being loaded with gaffs, losing $1,500 in one single fail during an incredibly tight three-day season. <br /><br />Knowing nothing about what's going on, their failures are easily predictable. Their plans are poorly thought through. For example, the captain cleverly saves a portion of each catch, packages it and freezes it to sell on nearby Labrador where prices are three times higher but he must haul it there by ferry and then through veritable wilderness, miles and miles of zero civilization, no gas station, no telephone connection, nothing, just them, their truck and their flatbed trailer. No road service whatsoever. And that calls for doubling of preparation but they do not do it. The captain must borrow a home-freezer from his grandmother but he never returns things. He takes it. It's beat up. It's dirty and scratched and in worse shape than an item in a garage sale. One of his items of fish, scallops, I think, must be kept frozen hard. The rest of haul can be on ice. The captain's solution is a generator.<br /><br />Sitting at home the viewer (me) predicts generator failure. There is no back up generator. It must fail. And his biggest payoff must be ruined. I prepare myself to sneer and mock when it does. Along the way the trailer has a flat. No spare for the trailer. The generator does fail. Their trip is reduced to a crawl, they drag into the small town with sparks flying from their load pushing down the axle onto the road. They park at the edge of town in a space just off the road and make a few sales right off. They get money exchanged immediately. Word spreads through the whole town in mere minutes and the entire town shows up en mass to make purchases of frozen seafood at their triple prices. They very quickly sell their product with enough money for repairs. So the trip is a success. It really is a great idea. Still very poorly thought through and with zero preparation beyond the initial idea, so a string of unnecessary difficulties turning a pleasant trip into an ordeal fraught with uncertainty. The whole thing could have gone much smoother with proper updated equipment and with just a bit of redundancy on critical parts, and with tools. But no. They sail, drive, and fly by the seat of their pants.<br /><br />As boys do.<br /><br />I like this show a lot. It's fun to watch and see how the other half lives. But it's frustrating as it is charming. The people are backward as much as they're lovely. This last episode, #8 for season 3, a woman sets back feminism by at least five decades. She's on a boat with men. So there is equality right there. There is a small boat approaching. The boats generator dies and the woman waiting to connect bends in half and buries her face in her hands at her knees in fear and frustration. Not the reaction needed for this emergency situation. The narrator describes fear among sailors, and fire is the worst of their fears. The scene is shot at night, the approaching boat's generator that stopped then bursts into flames. The woman's voice rises four octaves to siren pitch and she utters sounds that are not language. The men race around the woman self-assembling to save the life of the incoming fisherman. I thought the imperiled fisherman was her husband judging by her reaction, but he's not. He's another of their crew. There is a 5 gallon gas tank on the small boat near the burning generator. There is no place for the fisherman to go. The water is ice cold. The woman continues screeching very high pitched sounds but she doesn't do anything to help the men. She has no idea how to be any help while the men figure out how to handle this situation. Instead, one of the men must now comfort the woman. So one less man to assist as he comforts the crying distraught woman. She buries her head in his shoulder.

The Dems thought that the God Emperor would surrender on immigration and give them everything they want without any border enforcement. Without the Wall. You know the way that faggots like Bush and super faggots like Lady Graham are demanding. To give amnesty to illegals with nothing in return. They thought that the God Emperor would betray the people they way they do as a matter of course. But as another famous faggot said "Surprise, Surprise, Surprise." The God Emperor is holding true to the covenant that he made with his supporters. Even in the face of a government shut down. If that shatters the rice bowls of millions of government drones so much the better. They just can't believe it. They thought he would fold.

Well we remember that Jesus forgave the whores and the tax collectors. It is what you do going forward that counts not what you did in the past. The libs just can't understand this. They are just morons and Philistines.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Second is the government shut down. The Dems thought that the God Emperor would surrender on immigration and give them everything they want without any border enforcement. Without the Wall. You know the way that faggots like Bush and super faggots like Lady Graham are demanding. To give amnesty to illegals with nothing in return. They thought that the God Emperor would betray the people they way they do as a matter of course. But as another famous faggot said "Surprise, Surprise, Surprise." The God Emperor is holding true to the covenant that he made with his supporters. Even in the face of a government shut down. If that shatters the rice bowls of millions of government drones so much the better. They just can't believe it. They thought he would fold. All the right people in all the right conversations at all the right parties said he would. Not gonna happen assholes.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I just hope that he doesn't just break their rice bowls.

Make an end to them once and for all.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Because they are truly the enemy of the American people.

All the videos posted there yesterday are very good and well worth your while to watch. That way you can be the smarty pants at the party dance. Or if not, then be blissfully unaware like everyone else you run into at this imagined place.<br /><br />This post is about the contents put up yesterday on another website, The Conservative Treehouse, the Last Refuge.<br /><br />The treehouse is on fire.<br /><br />For months on end, a full year actually, the authors there (I presume more than one that post under one name, but I'm not certain) have been promising revelation by explosion and readers are weary of waiting without seeing results, and now we finally see the embers catch on. So much is happening right now it's nearly impossible to keep up and have the various threads pulled out of entanglement and kept straight. But first a question.<br /><br />When you're asked the philosophical question, if a tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it, does it make a sound? And the philosophical answer is no because by definition sound requires an ear to perceive sound waves. Look it up. The definition says sound is heard. Its how the question is posed. Should have asked, does it make those waves in the air that could be perceived as sound? Or, does a worm in the ground nearby still feel the vibrations? Or, is a bird's nest in the tree disrupted? Yes, the tree produces sound waves whether or not there is an ear to hear it, and whether that ear is hearing or deaf, whether or not the hard of hearing receptors have their hearing aids turned on.<br /><br />Well, now the whole forest of trees has fallen and Democrat party is resolutely willingly deaf to the sound of it, and American media takes all of their cues from Democrat party. So the sound must have to blast through them.<br /><br />Sundance first posts "<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/the-evidence-inside-the-house-intel-committee-four-page-fisa-memo/">The Evidence Inside the House Intel Committee four page FISA memo</a>" ... Where he explains why Nunes produced the memo. The reason is because of the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility that is housed by departments. Each compartment knows its own bit but does not have access to the other compartments. This memo consolidates the salient information that each compartment owns and provides a summation of the whole picture of corruption that runs through the FBI and DOJ under Obama. It shows how these departments were weaponized to use FISA courts to spy on the Trump campaign and to produce false evidence to destroy it. To destroy Trump. Worse, and even more serious for themselves, if Trump was elected then he'd have access to information about all that they did. And now that has actually happened. The memo takes a highly classified set of documents and consolidates them into one 4-paged document that is still classified but less, so that Congress men and women can all view them. Then, the idea is have President Trump to declassify the entire set of documents and presented for public view.<br /><br />As you know Watergate was about a break-in to Democrat party headquarters to steal information, and Nixon was impeached and forced into retirement because he learned of it later and hid information about the crime and he lied about what he knew. And now there is evidence that Democrat party and government departments committed crimes against Trump and Republican party and went to extremes of corruption to hide it. What is being revealed is several magnitudes of order greater than Watergate and far more damaging. And there is so much irony loaded into every single step at every level involving every &nbsp;principal that it isn't even possible to list them all. That Hillary Clinton was kicked off the Watergate commission for being too outrageously viciously wild in her attacks and is now central to her own similar crime in producing the dossier and central to its concealment is only one such insane irony to ponder.<br /><br />Sundance elaborates t<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/03/29/understanding-the-nunes-paradox/">he Nunes paradox</a>.<br /><br />Because the web of deceit is so complex, Sundance continuously reviews his graphic of principals working together interdepartmentally and with parties outside of government, and adds to them as they're revealed. He reprints his list of crucial turning points. He continuously reminds his readers of areas already covered at length so they see how new information fits into it. Or else his readers would not be able to follow. The whole thing becomes a bizarre mash of names and titles and departments and positions.<br /><br />Nunes created the memo as first step in exposing the full documents, to make documents classified top secret available to the public. This memo is available to Congress but they must go into a room to read it and so far all Democrat congressmen and women have refused to even look at it. Instead they create a distraction of shutting down government so that event is covered by their corrupted media instead. But this is too big. This will burst through their distraction.<br /><br />After Congress approves it for release then President Trump must approve it. Nobody doubts that he will.<br /><br />There is even talk about Trump possibly revealing key elements himself during his State of Union speech and then media will be forced to confront it.<br /><br />Then Sundance uploads this video in the title.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Az53n_eFXg" width="525"></iframe></div><br />Then an item about <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/president-trump-signs-2018-fisa-authorization-with-changes/">Trump signing 2018 FISA Authorization</a> with changes that prevent departments from doing the things that they did to Trump. This fairly well shows that Trump knows all about the details discussed at the treehouse. And knowing that makes you wonder why Trump doesn't tweet about that. And then you realize Trump is actually judicious in his tweets, even the ones that media and Democrats and GOPe claim are insane. Imagine knowing all this, and more, and just sitting there waiting for it to run its slow course, for the various forces arrayed against him to exhaust themselves. Watching these videos of Congressmen tell what they can at this point make you realize Trump is holding back to an extraordinary extent. Where he could lash out like Hitler and Stalin and a spoiled baby as he's been described.<br /><br />Then a video of <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-matt-gaetz-discusses-releasethememo-laws-were-broken/">Representative Matt Gaetz (R, Fla)</a> discussing the memo: "laws were broken" ... &nbsp;Sundance reiterates that by presenting a "less classified" summary of the contents of the "extremely classified" documentary evidence that has been protecting criminal activity in DOJ and FBI he is setting it up for opposition to question its validity. If Democrats attack the four-page memo then Nunes will request the Speaker of the House to declassify all of the underlying evidence, breaking the Compartmented Intelligence restriction. If Democrats dismiss the summary memo then they should support exposing the underlying evidence the memo was built on.<br /><br />Then, yet another related video <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-jim-jordan-discusses-releasethememo-fisa-abuse-and-doj-fbi-corruption/">Representative Jim Jordan discusses #releasethememo - FISA abuse and DOJ/FBI corruption.</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There have been daily revelations showing a considerable collaboration between the White House, Hillary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson; his wife Mary Jacoby, DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr and his wife Fusion GPS employee Nellie Ohr, Russian Dossier author Christopher Steele, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page; and the highest levels of officials within the FBI, including Chief Legal Counsel James Baker and FBI Asst. Director Andrew McCabe.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">All of the evidence points in one transparently obvious direction; toward a 2016 collaborative effort structured to use a counterintelligence operation to conduct wiretaps and surveillance on the presidential campaign of candidate Donald Trump.&nbsp;</blockquote>Ten of those words in this quote have links to deeper pages. A very good deal of information for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Finally, to end the day, yet another video of<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/tucker-carlson-interviews-donald-trump-jr-and-matt-gaetz/"> Tucker Carlson interviewing Donald Trump Jr. and Matt Gaetz ...&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;about the FISA summary memo and their plan to have the incredibly damaging classified information exposed. This is a very good video that I'm certain you'll value for several reasons including observing Trump Jr.'s stoic equanimity in the face of outrageous treatment. He compares time spent on this nonsense with time spent on Hillary's astounding handling of Benghazi. <br /><br />But wait. There's more.<br /><br />It's been a great day at the treehouse. There are two more videos unrelated to Nune's FISA memo that make America great.<br /><br />OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Press Briefing on Schumer Shutdown.<br /><br />And President Trump and Vice President Pence addressing the March for Life audience from the Rose Garden.<br /><br />And as always, comments number in the hundreds to each post and they're all worth your time reading.";s:4:"link";s:89:"http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2018/01/representative-ron-de-santis-r-fla.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (Chip Ahoy)";s:7:"summary";s:9913:"That is the title of just one video posted yesterday at the <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/page/2/">Conservative Treehouse</a>.

That Hillary Clinton was kicked off the Watergate commission for being too outrageously viciously wild in her attacks and is now central to her own similar crime in producing the dossier and central to its concealment is only one such insane irony to ponder.<br /><br />Sundance elaborates t<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/03/29/understanding-the-nunes-paradox/">he Nunes paradox</a>.<br /><br />Because the web of deceit is so complex, Sundance continuously reviews his graphic of principals working together interdepartmentally and with parties outside of government, and adds to them as they're revealed. He reprints his list of crucial turning points. He continuously reminds his readers of areas already covered at length so they see how new information fits into it. Or else his readers would not be able to follow. The whole thing becomes a bizarre mash of names and titles and departments and positions.<br /><br />Nunes created the memo as first step in exposing the full documents, to make documents classified top secret available to the public. This memo is available to Congress but they must go into a room to read it and so far all Democrat congressmen and women have refused to even look at it. Instead they create a distraction of shutting down government so that event is covered by their corrupted media instead. But this is too big. This will burst through their distraction.<br /><br />After Congress approves it for release then President Trump must approve it. Nobody doubts that he will.<br /><br />There is even talk about Trump possibly revealing key elements himself during his State of Union speech and then media will be forced to confront it.<br /><br />Then Sundance uploads this video in the title.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Az53n_eFXg" width="525"></iframe></div><br />Then an item about <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/president-trump-signs-2018-fisa-authorization-with-changes/">Trump signing 2018 FISA Authorization</a> with changes that prevent departments from doing the things that they did to Trump. This fairly well shows that Trump knows all about the details discussed at the treehouse. And knowing that makes you wonder why Trump doesn't tweet about that. And then you realize Trump is actually judicious in his tweets, even the ones that media and Democrats and GOPe claim are insane. Imagine knowing all this, and more, and just sitting there waiting for it to run its slow course, for the various forces arrayed against him to exhaust themselves. Watching these videos of Congressmen tell what they can at this point make you realize Trump is holding back to an extraordinary extent. Where he could lash out like Hitler and Stalin and a spoiled baby as he's been described.<br /><br />Then a video of <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-matt-gaetz-discusses-releasethememo-laws-were-broken/">Representative Matt Gaetz (R, Fla)</a> discussing the memo: "laws were broken" ... &nbsp;Sundance reiterates that by presenting a "less classified" summary of the contents of the "extremely classified" documentary evidence that has been protecting criminal activity in DOJ and FBI he is setting it up for opposition to question its validity. If Democrats attack the four-page memo then Nunes will request the Speaker of the House to declassify all of the underlying evidence, breaking the Compartmented Intelligence restriction. If Democrats dismiss the summary memo then they should support exposing the underlying evidence the memo was built on.<br /><br />Then, yet another related video <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/representative-jim-jordan-discusses-releasethememo-fisa-abuse-and-doj-fbi-corruption/">Representative Jim Jordan discusses #releasethememo - FISA abuse and DOJ/FBI corruption.</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There have been daily revelations showing a considerable collaboration between the White House, Hillary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson; his wife Mary Jacoby, DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr and his wife Fusion GPS employee Nellie Ohr, Russian Dossier author Christopher Steele, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page; and the highest levels of officials within the FBI, including Chief Legal Counsel James Baker and FBI Asst. Director Andrew McCabe.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">All of the evidence points in one transparently obvious direction; toward a 2016 collaborative effort structured to use a counterintelligence operation to conduct wiretaps and surveillance on the presidential campaign of candidate Donald Trump.&nbsp;</blockquote>Ten of those words in this quote have links to deeper pages. A very good deal of information for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Finally, to end the day, yet another video of<a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/19/tucker-carlson-interviews-donald-trump-jr-and-matt-gaetz/"> Tucker Carlson interviewing Donald Trump Jr. and Matt Gaetz ...&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;about the FISA summary memo and their plan to have the incredibly damaging classified information exposed. This is a very good video that I'm certain you'll value for several reasons including observing Trump Jr.'s stoic equanimity in the face of outrageous treatment. He compares time spent on this nonsense with time spent on Hillary's astounding handling of Benghazi. <br /><br />But wait. There's more.<br /><br />It's been a great day at the treehouse. There are two more videos unrelated to Nune's FISA memo that make America great.<br /><br />OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Press Briefing on Schumer Shutdown.<br /><br />And President Trump and Vice President Pence addressing the March for Life audience from the Rose Garden.<br /><br />And as always, comments number in the hundreds to each post and they're all worth your time reading.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1516441080;}i:17;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-717986195212622043.post-1898627258548302667";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 06:05:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:17:"Where's my water?";s:11:"description";s:1641:"Last night I was practicing interpreting a newsreader on video and came to the word "cartoon" and nothing came out of me automatically.

I don't care for olives myself, so I'm not the best judge, but I'm good enough to know there is no comparison in taste. The ones in jars and tins are anemic compared to the olives marketed carefully. I learned that by making <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/2009/05/olive-penguins.html">olive penguins</a> for Deena's party. I tasted a few out of a jar from the supermarket and compared them with a few from the olive bar at Whole Foods and although I don't like either one, the difference in quality exceeds 100%. They're probably twice as expensive but they're probably four or five times better. I could understand what they're supposed to be.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-food-fails-expectations-vs-reality/?page_numb=1">The page says 25+ examples</a>, but they mean 25 pages of examples, not 25 fails.

Whipped the egg whites in a glass jar then folded the béchamel thickened further with the four egg yolks into that along with two types of cheese. Then poured that into a small baking bowl. And that turned out great. And it got me thinking about doing the same thing except with a chocolate cake. I liked the idea of making an individual size. Such as they do with a tin can.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another of the failures listed is Halloween cookie fingers, and as God is my witness, I invented those over twenty years ago. For work. And my first try was a failure as shown on the fail page. But I learned from that first batch from the oven to add flour to the remainder of my peanut butter dough to stiffen it up. They still tasted like peanut butter but weaker than the usual peanut butter cookie. I learned to shape the knuckles by pushing both ends of the cookie worms to form a bulge in the middle. Then tap the bulge four times with a dinner knife to create wrinkles in the knuckle bulge. I learned to form the fingernail by pressing down flat with a dinner knife on the edge to shape cuticle and a flat surface for an icing fingernail. Then use the same knife to place icing flavored with almond extract to harden and form a fingernail. And color the same icing with red to dip the opposite ends for bloody stumps and allow it to drip back over the finger. And reserve some of the white icing to place a white dot on top of the red at the end for a chopped bone. Then I went throughout the entire bank as I did everyday but this time leaving cookie fingers in people's desks along side their pens, on their desks, in their pen cups, on the paper cutters by the copier machines, under the lid that you lift on the copiers all over the bank. On all the desks of my favorite secretaries, in the mail room by the electric letter opener, By electric pencil sharpeners. Everywhere people would find them one-by-one, and when I started hearing shrieks here and there I knew my plan came to its fruition. Those peanut butter fingers were a gigantic hit that Halloween and eventually people figured out on their own that I was responsible. And they saved them. They saved their stupid fingers. I had to talk them into eating them by promising to replace them. People came to my desk asking if I have any extra peanut butter fingers. Then everyone who did eat one started nibbling the fingernail. As if biting their own fingernail. That unexpected behavior was hilarious. They were very convincing fingers. Nothing at all like the ones shown on the fail page. And that whole idea came about because someone told me to bring finger food. So I did.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After fifty years of steaming rice, I'm only just now steaming it without rinsing first. In Tokyo our housekeeper taught me Japanese rice must be rinsed seven times. And to do that ritualistically and watch for the water to clear. So I followed her instructions for decades. Until two weeks ago. For sticky rice. I like it sticky. It's easier to eat with chopsticks. It can be colored brown like that for the bear with nearly anything. Like soy sauce. I think I could do this bear. But why?&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I made <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=rice+omelet">rice omelets before</a>, and they're very good, but never in the shape of a bear.

This person isn't even trying. I made them before and they always came out very good, <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=pretzels">if a little too fat</a>. This is where I learned to make mustard from powdered mustard. Originally I thought I had to have mustard seeds, and maybe that's best, but it's not necessary. I didn't know how much vinegar to use so I decided to use my own judgement, how much vinegar I wanted to go with that much powder, then continued adding water until the desired viscosity was reached.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You would not believe how fantastic this mustard is until you try it yourself. It's fierce the day that you make it and becomes less fierce as it is stored. Everyone who has tasted it agrees, it's the best mustard they've ever tasted. I used rice vinegar because that is my favorite but I imagine any vinegar will work just as well. Only three ingredients, mustard powder, vinegar, and water, boom, the best mustard you'll ever have. Since then, I buy multiple of mustard powder in tins. I buy it by the sack full from Whole Foods economy bins. There is simply no point in buying prepared mustard anymore.

While the tiny thread that connects them has heat. And the membrane that contains them is loaded with heat. To calm them down and make these hotdogs bearable, then remove all of the membrane inside.

The white snout and ears are probably Philadelphia cream cheese, and the black marks are probably minute bits of olive. The blanket is egg whisked thoroughly. The copy didn't even try.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There is an example of a cheese ball in the shape of a Christmas tree with olives pressed into it all around. Every type of olive available at the olive bar, to imitate bulb decorations. While the copy is all the same drab green olives from a jar. Or a tin. I don't care for olives myself, so I'm not the best judge, but I'm good enough to know there is no comparison in taste. The ones in jars and tins are anemic compared to the olives marketed carefully. I learned that by making <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/2009/05/olive-penguins.html">olive penguins</a> for Deena's party. I tasted a few out of a jar from the supermarket and compared them with a few from the olive bar at Whole Foods and although I don't like either one, the difference in quality exceeds 100%. They're probably twice as expensive but they're probably four or five times better. I could understand what they're supposed to be.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-food-fails-expectations-vs-reality/?page_numb=1">The page says 25+ examples</a>, but they mean 25 pages of examples, not 25 fails. The collection of food-fails goes on forever. The examples devolve into cake and cupcake fails and those are funny but less interesting. There is also a site for that, <a href="http://www.cakewrecks.com/">Cake Wrecks</a>, but that site shows only professional fails, they don't make fun of individuals trying to do something artistic. While having no mercy on pros.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I don't make cakes. Except this one birthday cake.

But honestly, I just don't care for cake.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Although I admit, yesterday I made a cheese soufflé in a jar. Whipped the egg whites in a glass jar then folded the béchamel thickened further with the four egg yolks into that along with two types of cheese. Then poured that into a small baking bowl. And that turned out great. And it got me thinking about doing the same thing except with a chocolate cake. I liked the idea of making an individual size. Such as they do with a tin can.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another of the failures listed is Halloween cookie fingers, and as God is my witness, I invented those over twenty years ago. For work. And my first try was a failure as shown on the fail page. But I learned from that first batch from the oven to add flour to the remainder of my peanut butter dough to stiffen it up. They still tasted like peanut butter but weaker than the usual peanut butter cookie. I learned to shape the knuckles by pushing both ends of the cookie worms to form a bulge in the middle. Then tap the bulge four times with a dinner knife to create wrinkles in the knuckle bulge. I learned to form the fingernail by pressing down flat with a dinner knife on the edge to shape cuticle and a flat surface for an icing fingernail. Then use the same knife to place icing flavored with almond extract to harden and form a fingernail. And color the same icing with red to dip the opposite ends for bloody stumps and allow it to drip back over the finger. And reserve some of the white icing to place a white dot on top of the red at the end for a chopped bone. Then I went throughout the entire bank as I did everyday but this time leaving cookie fingers in people's desks along side their pens, on their desks, in their pen cups, on the paper cutters by the copier machines, under the lid that you lift on the copiers all over the bank. On all the desks of my favorite secretaries, in the mail room by the electric letter opener, By electric pencil sharpeners. Everywhere people would find them one-by-one, and when I started hearing shrieks here and there I knew my plan came to its fruition. Those peanut butter fingers were a gigantic hit that Halloween and eventually people figured out on their own that I was responsible. And they saved them. They saved their stupid fingers. I had to talk them into eating them by promising to replace them. People came to my desk asking if I have any extra peanut butter fingers. Then everyone who did eat one started nibbling the fingernail. As if biting their own fingernail. That unexpected behavior was hilarious. They were very convincing fingers. Nothing at all like the ones shown on the fail page. And that whole idea came about because someone told me to bring finger food. So I did.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After fifty years of steaming rice, I'm only just now steaming it without rinsing first. In Tokyo our housekeeper taught me Japanese rice must be rinsed seven times. And to do that ritualistically and watch for the water to clear. So I followed her instructions for decades. Until two weeks ago. For sticky rice. I like it sticky. It's easier to eat with chopsticks. It can be colored brown like that for the bear with nearly anything. Like soy sauce. I think I could do this bear. But why?&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I made <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=rice+omelet">rice omelets before</a>, and they're very good, but never in the shape of a bear.

This person isn't even trying. I made them before and they always came out very good, <a href="http://thingsimadethenate.blogspot.com/search?q=pretzels">if a little too fat</a>. This is where I learned to make mustard from powdered mustard. Originally I thought I had to have mustard seeds, and maybe that's best, but it's not necessary. I didn't know how much vinegar to use so I decided to use my own judgement, how much vinegar I wanted to go with that much powder, then continued adding water until the desired viscosity was reached.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You would not believe how fantastic this mustard is until you try it yourself. It's fierce the day that you make it and becomes less fierce as it is stored. Everyone who has tasted it agrees, it's the best mustard they've ever tasted. I used rice vinegar because that is my favorite but I imagine any vinegar will work just as well. Only three ingredients, mustard powder, vinegar, and water, boom, the best mustard you'll ever have. Since then, I buy multiple of mustard powder in tins. I buy it by the sack full from Whole Foods economy bins. There is simply no point in buying prepared mustard anymore. All the mustard manufacturers do the same thing. And they buy their mustard seeds from us. Even the French do. They do have their boutique mustard fields, but the United States and Canada supply most the world's mustard seeds. And all they do is add vinegar and water. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I put a pile of pretzels in a bag into my backpack and took them into a nearby shop and announced "I have come bearing gifts."
