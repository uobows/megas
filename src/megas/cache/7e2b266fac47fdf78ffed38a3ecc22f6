This was a pub that was never on the circuit when I lived here or when I came back. It was too local perhaps, too manly, too boring in its beer choice (<a href="http://www.jwlees.co.uk/">Lees</a>) ? but over the past few years I have been dropping in now and again and, on a recent visit for a family funeral, on the way into town for the wake, I dropped in and had a formidably refreshing MPA and later on the way back a pale lager from <a href="http://www.pivovar-regent.cz/">Regent</a>, a brewery I once visited and thought ecclesiastical in its design. La Trappe, Moonraker and Manchester Star were also advertised, and, even though I was later told that the latter two were?t around, the choice (or the attempted choice) was a great example of how even my home town (where I grew up drinking Strongbow or lager top) has caught up with the times (it even has two breweries, <a href="http://www.greatormebrewery.co.uk/">Great Orme</a> and <a href="http://wildhorsebrewing.co.uk/">Wild Horse</a>, located close to where my father tried to set up an engineering business when I was a kid ? it failed, inevitably). As for the Links the floor around the mainly solidly wooden bar was tiled, there were blanquettes, as buttoned-up as a gin-soaked vicar silent in his obsession, a bit formulaic, taken from a catalogue, perhaps, a sense of the senselessness of suburbia in the surrounding drinking areas, Welsh being spoken (a rare sound in my home town), and ?make it a Christmas Day to remember? posters scattered about. However, as a hurricane (I think it might have been Brian) raged outside, the bar felt like a fortress of Monday evening solitude, as glasses gleamed and the chrome at the bar-top shone with a ghostly kind of light and the memory of my late sister-in-law swung back and forth like the wind-swept inn sign in <i>Treasure Island</i>.

As for the Links the floor around the mainly solidly wooden bar was tiled, there were blanquettes, as buttoned-up as a gin-soaked vicar silent in his obsession, a bit formulaic, taken from a catalogue, perhaps, a sense of the senselessness of suburbia in the surrounding drinking areas, Welsh being spoken (a rare sound in my home town), and ?make it a Christmas Day to remember? posters scattered about. However, as a hurricane (I think it might have been Brian) raged outside, the bar felt like a fortress of Monday evening solitude, as glasses gleamed and the chrome at the bar-top shone with a ghostly kind of light and the memory of my late sister-in-law swung back and forth like the wind-swept inn sign in <i>Treasure Island</i>. I will go back when I?m next in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llandudno">Llandudno</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1509957000;}i:3;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3076725205410370436.post-2655502722286887581";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:30:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:74:"alt-historyBig Jobcoaching innnostalgiaSt Austellthe GlobetopshamWestworld";s:5:"title";s:26:"A coaching inn in Topsham ";s:11:"description";s:3009:"<div style="font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="-webkit-font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;">Rat-a-tat.

The division, time and distance, 1895 the year <a href="http://www.budejovickybudvar.cz/en/index.html">Budvar</a> was kindled, in a town where German was the spoken word, while 2016 was when <a href="http://lostandgrounded.co.uk/">Lost &amp; Grounded</a> took root in the fertile soil (metaphorically speaking, in a sort of English) of Bristol. Both of them I visit in the space of 10 days, drink the beers their brewers produce, spend time amidst the gleaming turrets and tanks and spires and flights of fantasy that brewing kit (whether stainless steel in its nakedness or clothed in a copper carapace) seems to inspire in me. The brewing space in Budvar has the stillness of the cloisters about it, the monks nowhere to be seen, bending the knee in their devotions in another space perhaps, while Lost &amp; Grounded was a boisterous space of people drinking and appreciating and listening to beats from an another age (a DJ like a warrior throwing out his views on the world). In Budvar, as well as beers drunk at different ages, I tasted the water, bright and as clear as the air in a mythical mountain range straight out of Thomas Mann. It had no mineral character, or either salinity, both of which you would expect to pick up in a brewery?s water. It is neutral and plain in the taste with a purity of a child?s voice.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; line-height: normal; min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br /></span></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTFlvtmYN7s/WZ03xujJfVI/AAAAAAAADP4/v09dBqf-Kb0yn_HwmOljcgV_tV1gUzYQwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_3218.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1512" data-original-width="1512" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTFlvtmYN7s/WZ03xujJfVI/AAAAAAAADP4/v09dBqf-Kb0yn_HwmOljcgV_tV1gUzYQwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_3218.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; line-height: normal;"><span style="-webkit-font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, at Lost &amp; Grounded, I tasted collaboration.

The division, time and distance, 1895 the year <a href="http://www.budejovickybudvar.cz/en/index.html">Budvar</a> was kindled, in a town where German was the spoken word, while 2016 was when <a href="http://lostandgrounded.co.uk/">Lost &amp; Grounded</a> took root in the fertile soil (metaphorically speaking, in a sort of English) of Bristol. Both of them I visit in the space of 10 days, drink the beers their brewers produce, spend time amidst the gleaming turrets and tanks and spires and flights of fantasy that brewing kit (whether stainless steel in its nakedness or clothed in a copper carapace) seems to inspire in me. The brewing space in Budvar has the stillness of the cloisters about it, the monks nowhere to be seen, bending the knee in their devotions in another space perhaps, while Lost &amp; Grounded was a boisterous space of people drinking and appreciating and listening to beats from an another age (a DJ like a warrior throwing out his views on the world). In Budvar, as well as beers drunk at different ages, I tasted the water, bright and as clear as the air in a mythical mountain range straight out of Thomas Mann. It had no mineral character, or either salinity, both of which you would expect to pick up in a brewery?s water. It is neutral and plain in the taste with a purity of a child?s voice.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; line-height: normal; min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br /></span></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTFlvtmYN7s/WZ03xujJfVI/AAAAAAAADP4/v09dBqf-Kb0yn_HwmOljcgV_tV1gUzYQwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_3218.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1512" data-original-width="1512" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTFlvtmYN7s/WZ03xujJfVI/AAAAAAAADP4/v09dBqf-Kb0yn_HwmOljcgV_tV1gUzYQwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_3218.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; line-height: normal;"><span style="-webkit-font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, at Lost &amp; Grounded, I tasted collaboration.

Lazy and bucolic in the glass, juicy and citrusy and tart and peppery, it called to me with the yearning of a slow-played cello glutting itself on a surfeit of minor chords.

They have the ability to shush the palate and to rush their way along the gustatory highway to deliver refreshment and also compress sensations of acidity, juiciness, sprightliness, dryness, saltiness, tartness and a piquant bitterness all in one. And because they have the ability to introduce those who say they dislike beer they are the new alco-pops, but on the other hand I hardly think Amarillo Sour is the new WKD.

They were also both what are generally called sours, </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Similar thoughts had whisked over me with the soft petulance of a feather duster a couple of weeks ago whilst giving a talk at a beer conference in Cusco, Peru, on the state of sour beer in the UK ? within the audience of brewers, both newly pro and stay-at-homers, there was a real interest in sour beers, with several putting their hands up when I asked who was making a sour. A few days before I?d also filed a piece on sours for Imbibe magazine, making the point that sours had the ability to appeal to those who had always said that they didn?t like beer, ie wine drinkers who like their acidity, of which there is plenty within a sour beer. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sours (or wild beers or acidic beers, or whatever you want to call them), when they work are exemplary in the way they both tease and trounce the palate with their visions of a beer beyond what we know as beer. They have the ability to shush the palate and to rush their way along the gustatory highway to deliver refreshment and also compress sensations of acidity, juiciness, sprightliness, dryness, saltiness, tartness and a piquant bitterness all in one. And because they have the ability to introduce those who say they dislike beer they are the new alco-pops, but on the other hand I hardly think Amarillo Sour is the new WKD. But you never know. </span></div><!--EndFragment--><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1490079240;}i:15;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3076725205410370436.post-3970603619172874915";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 09 Mar 2017 12:41:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:16:"AndeshomeIPAPeru";s:5:"title";s:13:"Peruvian Gold";s:11:"description";s:2198:"<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQBHJb3WuHA/WMFMJVXfA7I/AAAAAAAAC6Q/0Yk1qerO3oABJSlXId7bByveuinRn1BEACLcB/s1600/IMG_0658.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQBHJb3WuHA/WMFMJVXfA7I/AAAAAAAAC6Q/0Yk1qerO3oABJSlXId7bByveuinRn1BEACLcB/s320/IMG_0658.JPG" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Yes, that?s one of them craft jam jars</i></b></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />Here is an IPA, an India Pale Ale.

Some perhaps brewing is romantic after all.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKI3aPFf4cU/V2aNf_Y7fiI/AAAAAAAACls/MXwI_vFen8EOpfffMFgZ4v77oqgIc_pAgCLcB/s1600/PICT0482.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKI3aPFf4cU/V2aNf_Y7fiI/AAAAAAAACls/MXwI_vFen8EOpfffMFgZ4v77oqgIc_pAgCLcB/s400/PICT0482.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="p1"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1466338740;}i:22;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3076725205410370436.post-1710697291160082366";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 04 Jun 2016 09:07:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:43:"bitterthe act of forgetting and remembering";s:5:"title";s:6:"Bitter";s:11:"description";s:641:"<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I?d forgotten about bitter, forgotten about that citrusy-slow build of sweetness, the words of toffee and hop spice, the crosstown traffic, the blistering bitterness, the dryness, the siren call of English hops, the warp and waft of the raw materials, the full body, its common touch (at which I have unforgivably sneered), the monstrosity, the leviathan, the well water hoisted, the sheer sheerness of it all.
