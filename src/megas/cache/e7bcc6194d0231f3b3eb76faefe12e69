That would explain the abundance of sideburns. The video was okay, not earth shattering, The corny backing vocals were a put off, but not enough to at least give these guys a look-see.

Even if you don't know the name, you've probably seen his work. Probably the most famous example is the album cover for Yes's <i>Fragile</i>. Even though I've always hated Yes as a band, and I'm not all that into trippy fantasy album covers, I have to admit that his style is very fluid, and he's good at what he does, though it's not my bag. After seeing the Yes LP cover and taking notice, it was easy to spot other work he did. Take for instance, the two album covers he did for Osibisa. They must have been in the very first thrift store I ever went to, and there's no doubt they were in the last one I was in. All over the place. I had no inclination to buy one of the albums, because I didn't like Yes and I figured it would likely be music that sounded like them. But then, after years of seeing their records in thrift stores and used record stores, I began to wonder why there were so many Osibisa LPs, yet no one I knew had heard them, and I'd never seen anything written about them. Still, even after downloads and YouTube appeared, I wasn't curious enough about their sound to even do a random search, still thinking that they were something like Yes. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kp6iwbb7lxk/WqoG-ou62xI/AAAAAAAARS4/D2apOIp9LsYYZZCYXd8VhI8gdAHJ8NqRACLcBGAs/s1600/b.osibisa1971.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="400" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kp6iwbb7lxk/WqoG-ou62xI/AAAAAAAARS4/D2apOIp9LsYYZZCYXd8VhI8gdAHJ8NqRACLcBGAs/s1600/b.osibisa1971.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">About a year ago I was in a record store and saw one of their LPs and something clicked, I realized why their records were dumped everywhere. They were probably bought by people that actually liked Yes and thought that because the cover art was very similar, they'd probably like Osibisa too. And they probably got rid of them en masse because they didn't sound like Yes. So, after years of seeing Osibisa records, I took the 99 cent bin challenge. Turns out they're a band from Ghana, and nothing like Yes. Maybe like an African version Fela meets Tower of Power or Malo or some shit like that. Different anyway. For 99 cents I got an entirely listenable LP, I solved a mystery, and a lesson in marketing.<br />&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wTfbogMenY4/WqoHSSjyNJI/AAAAAAAARS8/HGLKJJGWwRQYSIj0tkS8xJlCNxztzCHuwCLcBGAs/s1600/b.osibisa%2BMati%2BKlarwein.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wTfbogMenY4/WqoHSSjyNJI/AAAAAAAARS8/HGLKJJGWwRQYSIj0tkS8xJlCNxztzCHuwCLcBGAs/s1600/b.osibisa%2BMati%2BKlarwein.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of marketing, their third album would have been a instant snap.

They'll know, The conversation will go something like this "Oh man, he was one of those guys, Mostrite guitars, blah, blah, blah, instrumental band, blah, blah, blah, surf music, blah, not really surf music, blah blah, earlier than that, blah, blah, some boring, but a lot that was really good, blah, blah, really clean, sometimes too clean, blah, blah, shouldn't have recorded that Go-Gos song, the black spot on their career, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, Nokie Edwards was the straight shit." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All I really need to know about Nokie Edwards came from guitarists I know, and nearly all of them would spout something like that today.

Forty years! Now I know that their first records were decades ago, but I've always thought of them as eternally twenty something. The ladies are likely in their sixties now. But you know what? If I was in NY I'd be going. Hell yeah. They own their thing. The stripped down sound.&nbsp; I was always wondering how they decided to go that route, because their sound really was unique at the time. Today I found out what their intent was. In the blurb about the fortieth anniversary show that was in <i>The New Yorker</i>, the quote from singer Renee Scroggins from a 2013 interview.

Forty years! Now I know that their first records were decades ago, but I've always thought of them as eternally twenty something. The ladies are likely in their sixties now. But you know what? If I was in NY I'd be going. Hell yeah. They own their thing. The stripped down sound.&nbsp; I was always wondering how they decided to go that route, because their sound really was unique at the time. Today I found out what their intent was. In the blurb about the fortieth anniversary show that was in <i>The New Yorker</i>, the quote from singer Renee Scroggins from a 2013 interview. "When James Brown took it to the bridge, he cut all the horns. It was just that giant bass and the drums, and letting it rip for that instant. So I said 'Man, if you could just take a song and make it just the bridge, wouldn't that be hot!'" Fucking brilliant.

I'd heard them from those sources enough that I was in no hurry to actually buy their product. That changed when I saw the Dils, of all bands, do a cover of "Cathy's Clown". The Dils were one of the most politically charged, and tight, West Coast punk bands of the first wave. It was at a San Francisco gig and they were without their regular drummer, John Silvers, for a night so they enlisted the drummer from the Nuns, and Dil-ified a bunch of covers. When they played the Everlys' cover, it surprisingly played to one of their strengths I'd never noticed before, namely their harmonies, the almost Johnny Cash low voice of bassist Tony Kinman and the higher slightly nasally voice of guitarist Chip Kinman. It worked. That sent me back to San Diego with another band on the want list. I had everything by the Dils up to that point, and they never recorded "Cathy's Clown" so I bought a two LP compilation of the Everly Brothers and became a total freak of how their voices worked together. I owe that to the Dils.<br /><br />If you've never heard the Dils, just take a look at the video below of them, in Houston around the same I saw them. See if you can figure out how a band like that would turn someone onto the Everly Brothers.

Tony moved here from England, shit, about seven or eight years (maybe ten?) having bought a bar a few blocks away. Him and his business partner turned it into some sort of Irish bar that had bands, none of which played Irish music or had any noticeable signs of being Irish, except maybe on their Mom's side of the family, but the place was painted all green, called The Harp, played all the soccer games and had a bunch of beer company mirrors. <br /><br />But that wasn't the Tony I knew (and will hopefully still know for years to come). Tony was the one guy who lived in my apartment complex that knew the music I did. He was about my age and despite growing up in the UK had tastes remarkably like mine. Punk rock, reggae, rockabilly, all sorts of shit. One conversation that stuck with me for some reason was one that we had when John Holt died about three years ago. Tony mentioned Holt's LP <i>1,000 Volts of Holt</i> as a favorite and I concurred. When it's been a while since you last connected over a particular artist with someone outside of your little like minded musical clique, shit like that stands out. Just as one of my last conversations with Tony did. When I was lamenting the fact that there wouldn't be anyone around the complex to talk music with, he assured me there would. Yeah, I said, that might be the case, but only to a certain degree. He said that I would know their depth by asking one question, if they knew who Sky Saxon was.

You might not have known of hundreds of bands touring and putting out a plethora of product under the radar of the masses. It's crazy really. There's this religious fanaticism of the late seventies era punk fiends, that it was somehow the most legitimate era of anything punk related. As if anything that came later was disingenuous. Phooey. If you really look at things objectively, with the exception of a handful of bands, the majority of seventies punk bands, while well intended, often vital, good and all of that, were playing follow the leader. Ramones plus attitude equals Sex Pistols plus social issues equals the Clash plus one more trip back over the Atlantic equals a handful of spiky haired bands in every major city with a "scene". That, of course, led to Green Day, the Offspring and bands like them which really were kind of disingenuous. Maybe not at first, but a funny thing happened on the way to a major label. Call it the "eyes on the prize" route.&nbsp; Yeah, we'll do this, we'll make this concession, wait, MTV? Sure, I want to buy a house.<br /><br />Punk rock, or any variant of it, was never meant to be pretty, or easy, or a money maker. There was an international network of bands in the eighties through the nineties that still exists in some capacity today, that not only carried the torch but spit gasoline into it. The sleep on the floor van tours, playing shitholes and getting wasted, going crazy on stage and doing ridiculously stupid things offstage. There were a shitload of independent record labels, 45s coming out the ass of anyone with a four track recorder and the few hundred bucks to press a short run of vinyl. These guys, while mutating musically may have played more chords, or in many cases less, than the allotted three chords typically thought of as the formula for louder, faster, shorter blend of punk rock, they may have turned up louder, played without a bass player, or with two bass players, added a Farfisa or whatever, but these were the guys who, in most cases, really didn't seem to give a shit if they were signed or not. <br /><br />All of this shit came seeping back after reading Eric Davidson's <i>We Never Learn: The Gunk Punk Undergut, 1988-2001</i>. Davidson was in the New Bomb Turks, and was in the thick of it. The book is great, not just because of his accounts, but those of other bands, independent label people (many who had day jobs to pay the bills) and fanzine folks (ditto). A great reminder that "willful obscurity" can sometimes be a good thing. Sometimes it's the only pure thing.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 85%; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">~ NOTE: ALL MEDIA IS HOSTED BY THE BLOGS &amp; SITES NAMED BELOW ~</span></span></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">The Briefs - Rotten Love mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">at Killed By Death</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Go <a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">there</a> to get it</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/09/13/didjits-headless-7/">The Didjits - Headless mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/">at Killed By Death</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Go <a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/09/13/didjits-headless-7/">there</a> to get it</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://crasseux.com/New%20Bomb%20Turks/Nightmare%20Scenario/08-The%20Roof.mp3">New Bomb Turks - The Roof mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://crasseux.com/">at Crasseux (?)</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/0vg1DFJvCCc">The Morlocks.

Call it the "eyes on the prize" route.&nbsp; Yeah, we'll do this, we'll make this concession, wait, MTV? Sure, I want to buy a house.<br /><br />Punk rock, or any variant of it, was never meant to be pretty, or easy, or a money maker. There was an international network of bands in the eighties through the nineties that still exists in some capacity today, that not only carried the torch but spit gasoline into it. The sleep on the floor van tours, playing shitholes and getting wasted, going crazy on stage and doing ridiculously stupid things offstage. There were a shitload of independent record labels, 45s coming out the ass of anyone with a four track recorder and the few hundred bucks to press a short run of vinyl. These guys, while mutating musically may have played more chords, or in many cases less, than the allotted three chords typically thought of as the formula for louder, faster, shorter blend of punk rock, they may have turned up louder, played without a bass player, or with two bass players, added a Farfisa or whatever, but these were the guys who, in most cases, really didn't seem to give a shit if they were signed or not. <br /><br />All of this shit came seeping back after reading Eric Davidson's <i>We Never Learn: The Gunk Punk Undergut, 1988-2001</i>. Davidson was in the New Bomb Turks, and was in the thick of it. The book is great, not just because of his accounts, but those of other bands, independent label people (many who had day jobs to pay the bills) and fanzine folks (ditto). A great reminder that "willful obscurity" can sometimes be a good thing. Sometimes it's the only pure thing.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 85%; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">~ NOTE: ALL MEDIA IS HOSTED BY THE BLOGS &amp; SITES NAMED BELOW ~</span></span></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">The Briefs - Rotten Love mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">at Killed By Death</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Go <a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/06/29/the-briefs-poor-and-weird-7/">there</a> to get it</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/09/13/didjits-headless-7/">The Didjits - Headless mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/">at Killed By Death</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Go <a href="http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/09/13/didjits-headless-7/">there</a> to get it</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="http://crasseux.com/New%20Bomb%20Turks/Nightmare%20Scenario/08-The%20Roof.mp3">New Bomb Turks - The Roof mp3</a> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://crasseux.com/">at Crasseux (?)</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/0vg1DFJvCCc">The Morlocks.

That doesn't mean that Batio isn't a good guitarist. Technically he is excellent. Mindblowing even.

Eight bucks, worth twice that for one of the few Musslewhite songs I had heard, "Cha Cha the Blues". The song rules. A three minute instrumental that starts with a harp solo by Musslewhite, then a tight organ solo by Barry Goldberg, followed by a just plain awesome compact guitar solo by Harvey Mandel, and then ends with Musslewhite again.
