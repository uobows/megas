<b>In <i>Dirty Wars</i>, Jeremy Scahill, author of the New York Times best-seller <i>
Blackwater</i>, takes us inside America?s new covert wars. The foot soldiers
 in these battles operate globally and inside the United States with 
orders from the White House to do whatever is necessary to hunt down, 
capture or kill individuals designated by the president as enemies.</b><br />
<br />
Drawn from the ranks of the Navy SEALs, Delta Force, former Blackwater 
and other private security contractors, the CIA?s Special Activities 
Division and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), these elite 
soldiers operate worldwide, with thousands of secret commandos working 
in more than one hundred countries. Funded through ?black budgets,? 
Special Operations Forces conduct missions in denied areas, engage in 
targeted killings, snatch and grab individuals and direct drone, AC-130 
and cruise missile strikes. While the Bush administration deployed these
 ghost militias, President Barack Obama has expanded their operations 
and given them new scope and legitimacy. Dirty Wars follows the 
consequences of the declaration that ?the world is a battlefield,? as 
Scahill uncovers the most important foreign policy story of our time. 
From Afghanistan to Yemen, Somalia and beyond, Scahill reports from the 
frontlines in this high-stakes investigation and explores the depths of 
America?s global killing machine. He goes beneath the surface of these 
covert wars, conducted in the shadows, outside the range of the press, 
without effective congressional oversight or public debate. And, based 
on unprecedented access, Scahill tells the chilling story of an American
 citizen marked for assassination by his own government.<br />
<br />
As US leaders draw the country deeper into conflicts across the globe, 
setting the world stage for enormous destabilization and blowback, 
Americans are not only at greater risk?we are changing as a nation. 
Scahill unmasks the shadow warriors who prosecute these secret wars and 
puts a human face on the casualties of unaccountable violence that is 
now official policy: victims of night raids, secret prisons, cruise 
missile attacks and drone strikes, and whole classes of people branded 
as ?suspected militants.? Through his brave reporting, Scahill exposes 
the true nature of the dirty wars the United States government struggles
 to keep hidden.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Praise for <i>Dirty Wars</i>:</b><br />
<br />
?There is no journalist in America who has exposed the truth about US 
government militarism more bravely, more relentlessly and more valuably 
than Jeremy Scahill. <i>Dirty Wars</i> is highly gripping and dramatic, and of 
unparalleled importance in understanding the destruction being sown in 
our name.?<br />
?Glenn Greenwald, New York Times best-selling author and Guardian columnist<br />
<br />
?<i>Dirty Wars</i> tells us, with convincing detail and much new information, what has been done in the name of America since 9/11.?<br />
?Seymour Hersh<br />
<br />
?<i>Dirty Wars</i> is the most thorough and authoritative history I?ve read yet
 of the causes and consequences of America?s post-9/11 conflation of war
 and national security. I know of no other journalist who could have 
written it: For over a decade, Scahill has visited the war zones, overt 
and covert; interviewed the soldiers, spooks, jihadists, and victims; 
and seen with his own eyes the fruits of America?s bipartisan war fever.
 He risked his life many times over to write this book, and the result 
is a masterpiece of insight, journalism, and true patriotism.?<br />
