<p>?We are extremely pleased to join forces with the McDonald Observatory to bring this training to NPS park and regional office staff,? said Ray Sauvajot, NPS Associate Director for Natural Resource Stewardship and Science. ?The observatory?s experience with hands on training combined with the expertise of our Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division will provide new opportunities for career development, capacity building for the field, and leveraging our efforts toward enhancing visitor experience and the preservation of our national park night skies.?</p>
<p>Marc Wetzel, the observatory?s Senior Outreach Program Coordinator, will give two workshops for national park rangers.

<p>?This is a really fantastic partnership,? Wetzel said. ?The National Park Service shares similar goals for interpreting the night skies for visitors as we do.? He explained that ?dark skies are one of the parks? natural resources, in addition to water, mountains, and wildlife.</p>
<p>?This project is similar to what we?ve done successfully in the Texas state park system,? he added. It was McDonald Observatory?s work with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department that drew the National Park Service to propose collaboration with McDonald.</p>
<p>McDonald Observatory hosts hundreds of public star parties each year, showing tens of thousands of visitors a wide range of objects in night sky through multiple telescopes and leading naked-eye tours of the constellations. The observatory also provides daily programs for visitors to safely view the Sun.</p>
<p>Located near Fort Davis, Texas, the observatory hosts multiple telescopes undertaking a wide range of astronomical research under the darkest night skies of any professional observatory in the continental United States. It is home to the consortium-run Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), one of the world's largest, which has recently completed a $40-million upgrade. An internationally known leader in astronomy education and outreach, McDonald Observatory is also pioneering the next generation of astronomical research as a founding partner of the Giant Magellan Telescope.</p>

We're now in a tie.</p>
<p>The newly discovered Kepler-90i ? a sizzling hot, rocky planet orbiting its star once every 14.4 days ? was found using computers that ?learned? to find planets in data from NASA?s Kepler space telescope. Kepler finds distant planets beyond the solar system, or exoplanets, by detecting the minuscule change in brightness when a planet transits (crosses in front of) a star.</p>
<p>Vanderburg, a NASA Sagan fellow at UT Austin, and Shallue, a Google machine learning researcher, teamed up to train a computer to learn how to identify signs of an exoplanet in the light readings from distant stars recorded by Kepler. Similar to the way neurons connect in the human brain, this ?neural network? sifted through the Kepler data to identify the weak transit signals from a previously missed eighth planet orbiting Kepler-90, a sun-like star 2,545 light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco.</p>
<p>?For the first time since our solar system planets were discovered thousands of years ago, we know for sure that our solar system is not the sole record holder for the most planets,? Vanderburg said.</p>
<p>Other planetary systems, though, would probably hold more promise for life than Kepler-90?s system, which packs all eight planets closer to the host star than Earth is to the sun. In our solar system, only Mercury and Venus orbit between our planet and our sun. About 30 percent larger than Earth, Kepler-90i is so close to its star that its average surface temperature is thought to exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, on a par with Mercury. The outermost planet, Kepler-90h, is a gas giant that is about the size of Jupiter, circling with a "year" of 331.6 days.</p>

We're now in a tie.</p>
<p>The newly discovered Kepler-90i ? a sizzling hot, rocky planet orbiting its star once every 14.4 days ? was found using computers that ?learned? to find planets in data from NASA?s Kepler space telescope. Kepler finds distant planets beyond the solar system, or exoplanets, by detecting the minuscule change in brightness when a planet transits (crosses in front of) a star.</p>
<p>Vanderburg, a NASA Sagan fellow at UT Austin, and Shallue, a Google machine learning researcher, teamed up to train a computer to learn how to identify signs of an exoplanet in the light readings from distant stars recorded by Kepler. Similar to the way neurons connect in the human brain, this ?neural network? sifted through the Kepler data to identify the weak transit signals from a previously missed eighth planet orbiting Kepler-90, a sun-like star 2,545 light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco.</p>
<p>?For the first time since our solar system planets were discovered thousands of years ago, we know for sure that our solar system is not the sole record holder for the most planets,? Vanderburg said.</p>
<p>Other planetary systems, though, would probably hold more promise for life than Kepler-90?s system, which packs all eight planets closer to the host star than Earth is to the sun. In our solar system, only Mercury and Venus orbit between our planet and our sun. About 30 percent larger than Earth, Kepler-90i is so close to its star that its average surface temperature is thought to exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, on a par with Mercury. The outermost planet, Kepler-90h, is a gas giant that is about the size of Jupiter, circling with a "year" of 331.6 days.</p>

These early agglomerations of a few billion stars would then become the building blocks of the larger galaxies that came to dominate the universe after the first few billion years.</p>
<p>Ongoing observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), however, have discovered surprising examples of massive, star-filled galaxies seen when the cosmos was less than a billion years old. This suggests that smaller galactic building blocks were able to assemble into large galaxies quite quickly.</p>
<p>The latest ALMA observations, by McDonald Observatory astronomer Justin Spilker and colleagues, push back this epoch of massive-galaxy formation even further by identifying two giant galaxies seen when the universe was only 780 million years old, or about 5 percent its current age. ALMA also revealed that these uncommonly large galaxies are nestled inside an even-more-massive cosmic structure, a halo of dark matter several trillion times more massive than the sun.</p>
<p>The two galaxies are in such close proximity ? less than the distance from the Earth to the center of our galaxy ? that they will shortly merge to form the largest galaxy ever observed at that period in cosmic history. This discovery provides new details about the emergence of large galaxies and the role that dark matter plays in assembling the most massive structures in the universe.</p>
<p>The researchers report their findings in the journal <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature"><em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>?With these exquisite ALMA observations, astronomers are seeing the most massive galaxy known in the first billion years of the universe in the process of assembling itself,? said Dan Marrone, associate professor of astronomy at The University of Arizona in Tucson and lead author on the paper.</p>
<p>Astronomers are seeing these galaxies during a period of cosmic history known as the Epoch of Reionization, when most of intergalactic space was suffused with an obscuring fog of cold hydrogen gas. As more stars and galaxies formed, their energy eventually ionized the hydrogen between the galaxies, revealing the universe as we see it today.</p>
<p>?We usually view that as the time of little galaxies working hard to chew away at the neutral intergalactic medium,? said Marrone. ?Mounting observational evidence with ALMA, however, has helped to reshape that story and continues to push back the time at which truly massive galaxies first emerged in the universe.?</p>
<p>The galaxies that Marrone and his team studied, collectively known as SPT0311-58, were originally identified as a single source by the South Pole Telescope. These first observations indicated that this object was very distant and glowing brightly in infrared light, meaning that it was extremely dusty and likely going through a burst of star formation. Subsequent observations with ALMA revealed the distance and dual nature of the object, clearly resolving the pair of interacting galaxies.</p>
<p>To make this observation, ALMA had some help from a gravitational lens, which provided an observing boost to the telescope. Gravitational lenses form when an intervening massive object, like a galaxy or galaxy cluster, bends the light from more distant galaxies. They do, however, distort the appearance of the object being studied, requiring sophisticated computer models to reconstruct the image as it would appear in its unaltered state.</p>
<p>This ?de-lensing? process provided intriguing details about the galaxies, showing that the larger of the two is forming stars at a rate of 2,900 solar masses per year. It also contains about 270 billion times the mass of our sun in gas and nearly 3 billion times the mass of our sun in dust. ?That?s a whopping large quantity of dust, considering the young age of the system,? noted Justin Spilker, a recent graduate of the University of Arizona and now a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>The astronomers determined that this galaxy?s rapid star formation was likely triggered by a close encounter with its slightly smaller companion, which already hosts about 35 billion solar masses of stars and is increasing its rate of starburst at the breakneck pace of 540 solar masses per year.</p>
<p>The researchers note that galaxies of this era are ?messier? than the ones we see in the nearby universe. Their more jumbled shapes would be due to the vast stores of gas raining down on them and their ongoing interactions and mergers with their neighbors.</p>
<p>The new observations also allowed the researchers to infer the presence of a truly massive dark matter halo surrounding both galaxies. Dark matter provides the pull of gravity that causes the universe to collapse into structures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies, etc.).</p>
<p>?If you want to see if a galaxy makes sense in our current understanding of cosmology, you want to look at the dark matter halo ? the collapsed dark matter structure ? in which it resides,? said Chris Hayward, associate research scientist at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. ?Fortunately, we know very well the ratio between dark matter and normal matter in the universe, so we can estimate what the dark matter halo mass must be.?</p>
<p>By comparing their calculations with current cosmological predictions, the researchers found that this halo is one of the most massive that should exist at that time.</p>
<p>?There are more galaxies discovered with the South Pole Telescope that we?re following up on,? said Joaquin Vieira of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, ?and there is a lot more survey data that we are just starting to analyze. Our hope is to find more objects like this, possibly even more distant ones, to better understand this population of extreme dusty galaxies and especially their relation to the bulk population of galaxies at this epoch.?</p>
<p>?In any case, our next round of ALMA observations should help us understand how quickly these galaxies came together and improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation during reionization,? added Marrone.</p>

<p>The galaxies that Marrone and his team studied, collectively known as SPT0311-58, were originally identified as a single source by the South Pole Telescope. These first observations indicated that this object was very distant and glowing brightly in infrared light, meaning that it was extremely dusty and likely going through a burst of star formation. Subsequent observations with ALMA revealed the distance and dual nature of the object, clearly resolving the pair of interacting galaxies.</p>
<p>To make this observation, ALMA had some help from a gravitational lens, which provided an observing boost to the telescope. Gravitational lenses form when an intervening massive object, like a galaxy or galaxy cluster, bends the light from more distant galaxies. They do, however, distort the appearance of the object being studied, requiring sophisticated computer models to reconstruct the image as it would appear in its unaltered state.</p>
<p>This ?de-lensing? process provided intriguing details about the galaxies, showing that the larger of the two is forming stars at a rate of 2,900 solar masses per year. It also contains about 270 billion times the mass of our sun in gas and nearly 3 billion times the mass of our sun in dust. ?That?s a whopping large quantity of dust, considering the young age of the system,? noted Justin Spilker, a recent graduate of the University of Arizona and now a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>The astronomers determined that this galaxy?s rapid star formation was likely triggered by a close encounter with its slightly smaller companion, which already hosts about 35 billion solar masses of stars and is increasing its rate of starburst at the breakneck pace of 540 solar masses per year.</p>
<p>The researchers note that galaxies of this era are ?messier? than the ones we see in the nearby universe. Their more jumbled shapes would be due to the vast stores of gas raining down on them and their ongoing interactions and mergers with their neighbors.</p>
<p>The new observations also allowed the researchers to infer the presence of a truly massive dark matter halo surrounding both galaxies. Dark matter provides the pull of gravity that causes the universe to collapse into structures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies, etc.).</p>
<p>?If you want to see if a galaxy makes sense in our current understanding of cosmology, you want to look at the dark matter halo ? the collapsed dark matter structure ? in which it resides,? said Chris Hayward, associate research scientist at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. ?Fortunately, we know very well the ratio between dark matter and normal matter in the universe, so we can estimate what the dark matter halo mass must be.?</p>
<p>By comparing their calculations with current cosmological predictions, the researchers found that this halo is one of the most massive that should exist at that time.</p>
<p>?There are more galaxies discovered with the South Pole Telescope that we?re following up on,? said Joaquin Vieira of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, ?and there is a lot more survey data that we are just starting to analyze. Our hope is to find more objects like this, possibly even more distant ones, to better understand this population of extreme dusty galaxies and especially their relation to the bulk population of galaxies at this epoch.?</p>
<p>?In any case, our next round of ALMA observations should help us understand how quickly these galaxies came together and improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation during reionization,? added Marrone.</p>

The light of a planet's parent star far outshines the light from the planet itself, making the planet difficult to see. While taking a picture of a small rocky planet like Earth is still not feasible, researchers have made strides by snapping images of about 20 giant planet-like bodies. These objects, known as planetary-mass companions, are more massive than Jupiter, orbit far from the glare of their stars, and are young enough to still glow with heat from their formation ? all traits that make them easier to photograph.</p>
<p>But one big question remains: Are these planetary-mass companions actually planets, or are they instead small "failed" stars called brown dwarfs? Brown dwarfs form like stars do ? out of collapsing clouds of gas ? but they lack the mass to ignite and shine with starlight. They can be found floating on the their own in space, or they can be found orbiting with other brown dwarfs or stars. The smallest brown dwarfs are similar in size to Jupiter and would look just like a planet when orbiting a star.</p>
<p>Researchers at Caltech and The University of Texas at Austin have taken a new approach to the mystery: They have measured the spin rates of three of the photographed planetary-mass companions and compared them to spin rates for small brown dwarfs. The results offer a new set of clues that hint at how the companions may have formed.</p>
<p>"These companions with their high masses and wide separations could have formed either as planets or brown dwarfs," says Caltech graduate student Marta Bryan, lead author of a new study describing the findings in the journal <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. "In this study, we wanted to shed light on their origins."</p>
<p>"These new spin measurements suggest that if these bodies are massive planets located far away from their stars, they have properties that are very similar to those of the smallest brown dwarfs," says Heather Knutson, professor of planetary science at Caltech and a co-author of the paper.</p>
<p>The astronomers, including UT Austin?s Brendan Bowler, used the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to measure the spin rate, or the length of a day, of three planetary-mass companions known as ROXs 42B b, GSC 6214-210 b, and VHS 1256-1257 b. They used an instrument at Keck called the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to dissect the light coming from the companions. As the objects spin on their axes, light from the side that is turning toward us shifts to shorter, bluer wavelengths, while light from the receding side shifts to longer, redder wavelengths. The degree of this shifting indicates the speed of a rotating body. The results showed that the three companions' spin rates ranged between 6 to 14 kilometers per second, similar to rotation rates of our solar system's gas giant planets Saturn and Jupiter.</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers also included the two planetary-mass companions for which spin rates had already been measured. One, ? Pictoris b, has a rotation rate of 25 kilometers per second ? the fastest rotation rate of any planetary-mass body measured so far.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the spin rates for the five companions to those measured previously for small free-floating brown dwarfs. The ranges of rotation rates for the two populations were indistinguishable. In other words, the companions are whirling about their own axes at about the same speeds as their free-floating brown-dwarf counterparts.</p>
<p>The results suggest two possibilities. One is that the planetary-mass companions are actually brown dwarfs. The second possibility is that the companions looked at in this study are planets that formed, just as planets do, out of disks of material swirling around their stars, but for reasons not yet understood, the objects ended up with spin rates similar to those of brown dwarfs. Some researchers think that both newly forming planets and brown dwarfs are encircled by miniature gas disks that might be helping to slow their spin rates. In other words, similar physical processes may leave planets and brown dwarfs with similar spin rates.</p>
<p>"It's a question of nature versus nurture," says Knutson. "Were the planetary companions born like brown dwarfs, or did they just end up behaving like them with similar spins?"</p>
<p>The team also says that the companions are spinning more slowly than expected. Growing planets tend to be spun up by the material they pull in from a surrounding gas disk, in the same way that spinning ice skaters increase their speed, or angular momentum, when they pull their arms in. The relatively slow rotation rates observed for these objects indicate that they were able to effectively put the brakes on this spin-up process, perhaps by transferring some of this angular momentum back to encircling gas disks. The researchers are planning future studies of spin rates to further investigate the matter.</p>
<p>"Spin rates of planetary-mass bodies outside our solar system have not been fully explored," says Bryan. "We are just now beginning to use this as a tool for understanding formation histories of planetary-mass objects."</p>
<p>The study, titled, "Constraints on the Spin Evolution of Young Planetary-Mass Companions," was funded by NASA and the Sloan Research Fellowship Program. Other authors include Caltech's Konstantin Batygin, assistant professor of planetary science and Van Nuys Page Scholar; Björn Benneke, formerly of Caltech and now of the University of Montreal; and Brendan Bowler of The University of Texas at Austin.</p>

NASA?s James Webb Space Telescope, the powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, is expected to launch in 2019 after decades of development. Now the agency has announced the scientists who will use the $8 billion telescope first, testing its instruments to prove it?s in good working order. Steven Finkelstein, an associate professor of astronomy at The University of Texas at Austin, leads one of the chosen Early Release Science projects as principal investigator. </p>
<p>?This will be the first time anyone has had access to this brand new telescope that is in some ways 100 times better than Hubble,? Finkelstein said. ?This telescope will reveal enormous truths the moment we turn it on.?</p>
<p>Finkelstein leads the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. CEERS is a continuation of his work with the Hubble Space Telescope, studying the youngest galaxies in the early universe to understand how fast stars formed in these early galaxies and how galaxies evolve over time. The CEERS team is made up of 105 astronomers from 10 countries and includes researchers from 28 U.S. universities.</p>
<p>Finkelstein and the CEERS team will combine his new Webb Telescope study with his previous Hubble studies by focusing on some of the same regions of sky in a new light ? literally. Webb will study the universe in infrared light, whereas Hubble specializes mostly in optical light (the kind of light our eyes can see).</p>
<p>Using Webb, Finkelstein said, ?we will discover the most distant galaxies ever seen ? galaxies that were literally invisible to Hubble.? He explained that Webb will see galaxies as they existed 13.4 billion years ago, when the universe was less than 3 percent of its current age.</p>
<p>The CEERS proposal was one of just 13 selected from more than 100 submitted to NASA for early access to Webb. CEERS was selected based on the importance of the science it will do, as well as the fact it will use multiple instruments on the telescope and test many different modes of observing. In short, CEERS will put the Webb through its paces.</p>
<p>The project will be carried out in the telescope?s first five months of operation. The data Finkelstein?s team collects will be made available immediately to other scientists around the world. ?We?ll be working hard to rapidly produce usable data products for the astronomy community,? he said. </p>
<p>In all, UT Austin astronomers are involved in five of the telescope?s 13 early release science programs. In addition to Finkelstein?s leadership of CEERS, UT astronomers are taking important roles as co-investigators on three other projects: Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow Brendan Bowler and assistant professor Adam Kraus in a project that will image planets around other stars, research scientist Kristen McQuinn in a project to study populations of stars, and McDonald Postdoctoral Fellow Justin Spilker in a project to study galaxies that exhibit an optical effect called gravitational lensing. Several more UT astronomers, including many graduate students, are collaborators on early Webb projects.</p>
