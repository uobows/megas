Proc Fiskal further explores the sweet spot between dark garage, grime and ragga jungle. <a href="http://www.addictech.com/p/268797">http://www.addictech.com/p/268797</a><br /><br />Cosmic Bridge kicks off 2018 with an energetic four-track EP full of fresh ideas. Proc Fiskal is the alias of 21-year-old Joe Powers, an Edinburgh native who fell in love with UK dance music and the various strains of the hardcore continuum thanks to YouTube. He refined these inspirations at 160 bpm and began to receive airplay from the likes of grime veteran DJ Spooky. A debut EP for Hyperdub followed in 2017, speeding grime to jungle tempos for fascinating results. These unique tracks caught the ears of Om Unit leading to the Hello Boss EP, on which Proc Fiskal further explores the sweet spot between dark garage, grime and ragga jungle.<br /><br />The tracks on Hello Boss were produced with DJs in mind. They?re energetic, versatile, and above all highly contagious in the dance. ?A Fragrance? imagines Potential Badboy hanging out in the studio with Osmosis. The result is a fresh combination of mid-?90s jungle and UK garage with tightly-edited breakbeats, snapping drums, and a dark bassline clashing against flutes, sirens, horns and vocal samples. ?Hello Boss? was inspired by a stand-off scene in a Bollywood movie, drawing its main sample from it and a tension that plays out in the interaction between drums and bassline. This is peak time dancefloor action, a dark roller to shake out the demons. Can you dig it? ?Who Can?t Hear? is the most direct jungle production on the EP and shows Proc Fiskal for the dutiful student he is, able to tame the undiluted power of classic jungle with a modern touch: resonant bassline, smooth breakbeats, floating percussion, uplifting pads and a flurry of samples for a pure blast of junglistic joy. ?Window Cat? closes the EP with a grime touch as icy, angular melodies rub against a robust bassline and sharp claps.<br /><br />Hello Boss highlights the ingenuity and energy that can be found in the cracks of 160 bpm dance music, a space with enough room for innovation. It?s a natural fit for Cosmic Bridge, a label that has made its name by celebrating the weirdness on the fringes of genres. As Om Unit puts it, ?Proc Fiskal?s sound fits sonically as well as logically alongside some of the pioneers we have supported over the years.?&nbsp;</div>";s:4:"link";s:80:"http://addictechnews.blogspot.com/2018/03/here-we-have-hello-boss-ep-cosmic.html";s:6:"author";s:29:"noreply@blogger.com (Unknown)";s:7:"summary";s:2496:"<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Here we have the Hello Boss EP Cosmic Bridge Records!

When it came time to build another EP for Critical, I decided to link up with my good friend and long-time collaborator Rider Shafique, who has a much deeper knowledge of this music than me, and together create something that references both old and new dancehall, while still being playable in the kinds of sets I?ve become known for. There?s no ?halftime? and no chopped-up jungle breaks here ? we wanted to make something really focussed and even ?disciplined? ? and hopefully we?ve succeeded. Big shouts to the vocal collaborators ? super hyped to work with Stush on a tune, Irah came through with the righteous fire, and Tiffanie Malvo absolutely bodied her beat ? but ultimate biggups have to go to Rider. This wasn?t a project where I made the beats and Rider voiced them ? for pretty much every tune, we worked and reworked the riddims together. We?re both stoked on the results, and it seems like people in the dance feel the same way.?

When it came time to build another EP for Critical, I decided to link up with my good friend and long-time collaborator Rider Shafique, who has a much deeper knowledge of this music than me, and together create something that references both old and new dancehall, while still being playable in the kinds of sets I?ve become known for. There?s no ?halftime? and no chopped-up jungle breaks here ? we wanted to make something really focussed and even ?disciplined? ? and hopefully we?ve succeeded. Big shouts to the vocal collaborators ? super hyped to work with Stush on a tune, Irah came through with the righteous fire, and Tiffanie Malvo absolutely bodied her beat ? but ultimate biggups have to go to Rider. This wasn?t a project where I made the beats and Rider voiced them ? for pretty much every tune, we worked and reworked the riddims together. We?re both stoked on the results, and it seems like people in the dance feel the same way.?

In the process he has found success by striving for more feeling, for a more human and daring electronic music. This journey continues with 'Self', Coles' third album as Om Unit and a true follow-up to his 2013 debut 'Threads'.<br /><br />'Self' captures Coles in a period of growth, change, and experimentation. Inspired by personal psychological and emotional healing work, and a vision of the self as an egg ? which Coles later on discovered is a Jungian archetype ? the album blends dubwise, bass-heavy music with the space of experimental ambient compositions and the daring imagination of a cold wave science fiction soundtrack.<br /><br />The first Om Unit album on Coles' own Cosmic Bridge label, 'Self' offers new forms amid familiar touches. Stripping away what people might expect, Coles deconstructed and reimagined his work so far as a challenge to himself and, in turn, to his fans.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Cold Love' and 'Passages', two minimalist tracks that deconstruct the tropes Om Unit has become best known for and teases the listener with games of tension and release. This approach is revisited later with 'Unmasked', what Coles describes as 'a power diagram' of dancefloor ideas, and 'Field of Dreams', which began as an imagined dream about hardcore and ends up like a rave track heard inside someone else's head, a mediation on the roots of a sound that has been central to Coles' career so far.<br /><br />Some choice vocal collaborations help anchor 'Self' beyond the abstractions of instrumental music. Bristol's Rider Shafique lends his rugged voice to an inner monologue on 'Nothing'. As the track's rhythm unfolds at a seemingly glacial pace, Rider invites the listeners to embrace suffering and see how "in order to grow, we need the sunshine just as much as we need the rain." Manchester's DRS, whom Coles calls "one of the realest lyricists in drum &amp; bass," takes an equally empowering approach on 'Make Believe' over a beat that skews structural expectations. The last, but by no means least, vocal contributor is Amos, aka Amina Osmano of A/T/O/S, who lends her soulful tones to 'What I Can Be', an uplifting song that leads listeners into the light.<br /><br />Fans of Om Unit's more dancefloor-minded output are not forgotten. There's the epic 'Out of the Shadows', inspired by the importance of releasing trauma from our bodies, it's meld of soaring strings and gentle breakbeats bringing to mind classic era Metalheadz or early Massive Attack; the hopeful dance music of 'Twilight' with its inviting flute sample and punchy rhythms; the dubstep meets jungle of 'Despite It All'; and the romantic yet melancholy footwork of 'Cloudwerk'. The album ends with 'Tahatan', the Sioux word for hawk and ? via its rhythmic lurch, bird samples, and layering ? an invocation of key steps in Om Unit's journey to date.<br /><br />As Coles admits 'Self' is not an obvious album, but then again he has never been an obvious producer. Over the years that has meant exploring the potentials of hip-hop beats, the space of slow-motion house music, or the frenzy of footwork patterns and coming out the other side with personal takes fashioned from experience, experimentation, and excitement. With 'Self', Coles is once again putting Om Unit forward as a connector ? between musical ideas, studio techniques, and potential emotional outcomes ? rather than a purveyor. The album hides its beauty behind stylistic flexibility, inviting listeners to hear and feel the experiences and memories that make up who we are. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://addictechnews.blogspot.com/2017/11/addictechcom-featured-release-om-unit.html";s:6:"author";s:29:"noreply@blogger.com (Unknown)";s:7:"summary";s:4190:"<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Om Unit?s ?Self? ?Scale? is the latest full length album of eclectic bass wizardy from all angles! - <a href="http://www.addictech.com/p/257186">http://www.addictech.com/p/257186</a> #omunit #cosmicbridge #bassmusic #bass #drumandbass #halftime #dubstep #dub #sublife #organic #tribal #dopetrack #dope #instamusic #goodmusic #newmusic #undergroundmusic<br /><br />Since Jim Coles took on the mantle of Om Unit, the English producer has sought to challenge himself and his audience by going beyond the confines of genres and styles he has so far explored.
