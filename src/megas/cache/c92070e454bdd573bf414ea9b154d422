And so for purposes of humour and education we have provided some of the more unusual responses here.<br /><br /><strong><u><span style="color: #0b5394;">Name a species of dinosaur?</span></u></strong><br /><br />We can probably thank films like Jurassic Park for popularising the obvious top answer of Tyranosaurus Rex, as it has been demonised and turned into a ferocious hulking killer, something nightmares are made of.&nbsp;Other dinosaurs which featured in the survey responses were Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, Triceratops, Velociraptor, Diplodocus and Pteradactyl. Given the Jurassic Park influence it is surprising Velociraptor did not feature more prominently. No chicken sized Compsognathus either...<br /><br /><strong><u><span style="color: #0b5394;">Name a famous London tourist attraction?</span></u></strong><br /><br />Buckingham palace? Downing Street?

This was followed in popularity by flowers and plants, garden sheds.

Whilst the top answers were as expected, with Sooty and Basil Brush, less popular answers included Gordon the Gopher, Captain Scarlet, Finger Mouse, Troy Tempest, and Andy Pandy. Perhaps equally surprising then is that neither mangy Hartley Hare or Bagpuss featured. Stranger answers that did included cartoon character Bart Simpson and Teletubby La-La.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0b5394;"><u><strong>Name an activity you do with one hand?</strong></u></span><br /><br />The question immediately begs a x-rated answer, and indeed our respondents obliged with what one reply referred to as "Indulge in Oneism", and which we tweely categorised as "the naughty thing". In the interests of politeness you might want to wash your one hand before partaking of the other responses: shaking hands, writing, shaving, painting, playing darts&nbsp;or brushing your teeth...<br /><br /><u><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Name an activity enjoyed by pensioners?</span></strong></u><br /><br />Not dead yet, but hoping whistfully for the grave according to our survey. Activities enjoyed by our elder citizens according to our scientifically conducted&nbsp;poll include drinking, gossiping, being grumpy, moaning, sleeping and death.

Our team is Nathan who knows everything there is to know about popular dance culture, violent films of the 1990s, recreational drugs, and anagrams of terms of abuse. Emma specialises in anything fluffy,&nbsp;soap operas and bizarrely Bollywood. Andy who has been sold as knowing everything, but only seems to know everything that the rest of us knew anyway. Richard who specialises in comic books, and spending his teen years in his bedroom.&nbsp;And there's me, mopping up anything else.<br /><br />It's been a great night and everyone is enjoying themselves. But then unexpectedly disaster strikes. Unexpected to everyone, that is [and here is the shocking bit] - including the quiz host.<br /><br />And what is it that shatters the pleasure of the evening? Is the building on fire or under attack? Has a fight started by the pool table, or someone misjudged a dart and planted it in the middle of the large plasma tv which takes pride of place on one wall, or taken out One Eyed Sharon's good eye with a ricochet? No such thing - put simply - our quizmaster has not done his homework. Cue balls-up in the quiz proceedings:<br /><br />"Who was the first - eh, that's not right. Bloody 'ell there's no answer with this question."<br /><br />Confusion reigns for a couple of minutes, while he shuffles and rifles somewhat embarassed through several sheets of paper, and then decides to plough on. <br /><br />"Ok, next question: What is the name of Paul McCartney's wife, who has only one leg? Eh, what? He got divorced from her? Aw bloody 'ell. What do you mean he has a new wife? We're having a right week this week.&nbsp;"<br /><br />Again howls of derision and impatience. A group in the corner who came to play for the first time this week seem highly amused by how unprofessional the quiz is, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be back next week. I can hear circus music playing in my subconscious mind, and see the quiz master with size 22 shoes, braces and a flame red Ronald McDonald wig and nose. Someone pass&nbsp;me a&nbsp;custard pie.<br /><br />Determined not to be put off the quiz master continues. "Who&nbsp;plays Darth Vader&nbsp;in Star Wars? What do you mean which one? There is only one Darth Vader. Oh, which film? What? What do you mean who plays him physically or provides his voice?"<br /><br />By now the regulars are getting rowdy and unsettled.&nbsp;There are arguments breaking out all over the room. The quiz master looks and sounds like he would rather be somewhere else. Some of us feel the same. Lynch mob mentality is spreading around the room...<br /><br /><u><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Lessons From the Front Line - Check Your Material Is Complete and Accurate</span></strong></u><br /><br />What can you learn from this ridiculous situation?<br /><br />Well, for a start you might want to<strong> check through your questions&nbsp;BEFORE you present your quiz</strong>. As a minimum of preparation you would expect to read through what you are presenting - and especially so if this is not your own finely honed, expertly researched handiwork. If you downloaded your questions from a website then double check what you have presumably paid for just as a precaution. After all, remember the&nbsp;six p's: <strong>P</strong>roper <strong>P</strong>reparation <strong>P</strong>revents <strong>P</strong>iss <strong>P</strong>oor <strong>P</strong>erformance.... Your quiz should be both complete and accurate. You really only have yourself to blame if your quiz has badly worded questions, is missing petinent facts, or worst of all - the answers!<br /><br />If you have time you might want to check the answers for accuracy too - it's not enough that they just be present. Whilst obviously over simplifying - stating that the answer to 5 +3 = 10 will get you strung up from the light fittings for being obviously factually inaccurate. Stating that someone starred in a&nbsp; film when they didn't will lose you an arm or a leg in some venues, get the name wrong and you might never be asked back. Reliance on an outdated resource for quiz compiling might mean that your quiz is out of date too, and this could give rise to arguments amongst your quiz &nbsp;teams and disagreements when you come to present the answers.

Our team is Nathan who knows everything there is to know about popular dance culture, violent films of the 1990s, recreational drugs, and anagrams of terms of abuse. Emma specialises in anything fluffy,&nbsp;soap operas and bizarrely Bollywood. Andy who has been sold as knowing everything, but only seems to know everything that the rest of us knew anyway. Richard who specialises in comic books, and spending his teen years in his bedroom.&nbsp;And there's me, mopping up anything else.<br /><br />It's been a great night and everyone is enjoying themselves. But then unexpectedly disaster strikes. Unexpected to everyone, that is [and here is the shocking bit] - including the quiz host.<br /><br />And what is it that shatters the pleasure of the evening? Is the building on fire or under attack? Has a fight started by the pool table, or someone misjudged a dart and planted it in the middle of the large plasma tv which takes pride of place on one wall, or taken out One Eyed Sharon's good eye with a ricochet? No such thing - put simply - our quizmaster has not done his homework. Cue balls-up in the quiz proceedings:<br /><br />"Who was the first - eh, that's not right. Bloody 'ell there's no answer with this question."<br /><br />Confusion reigns for a couple of minutes, while he shuffles and rifles somewhat embarassed through several sheets of paper, and then decides to plough on. <br /><br />"Ok, next question: What is the name of Paul McCartney's wife, who has only one leg? Eh, what? He got divorced from her? Aw bloody 'ell. What do you mean he has a new wife? We're having a right week this week.&nbsp;"<br /><br />Again howls of derision and impatience. A group in the corner who came to play for the first time this week seem highly amused by how unprofessional the quiz is, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be back next week. I can hear circus music playing in my subconscious mind, and see the quiz master with size 22 shoes, braces and a flame red Ronald McDonald wig and nose. Someone pass&nbsp;me a&nbsp;custard pie.<br /><br />Determined not to be put off the quiz master continues. "Who&nbsp;plays Darth Vader&nbsp;in Star Wars? What do you mean which one? There is only one Darth Vader. Oh, which film? What? What do you mean who plays him physically or provides his voice?"<br /><br />By now the regulars are getting rowdy and unsettled.&nbsp;There are arguments breaking out all over the room. The quiz master looks and sounds like he would rather be somewhere else. Some of us feel the same. Lynch mob mentality is spreading around the room...<br /><br /><u><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Lessons From the Front Line - Check Your Material Is Complete and Accurate</span></strong></u><br /><br />What can you learn from this ridiculous situation?<br /><br />Well, for a start you might want to<strong> check through your questions&nbsp;BEFORE you present your quiz</strong>. As a minimum of preparation you would expect to read through what you are presenting - and especially so if this is not your own finely honed, expertly researched handiwork. If you downloaded your questions from a website then double check what you have presumably paid for just as a precaution. After all, remember the&nbsp;six p's: <strong>P</strong>roper <strong>P</strong>reparation <strong>P</strong>revents <strong>P</strong>iss <strong>P</strong>oor <strong>P</strong>erformance.... Your quiz should be both complete and accurate. You really only have yourself to blame if your quiz has badly worded questions, is missing petinent facts, or worst of all - the answers!<br /><br />If you have time you might want to check the answers for accuracy too - it's not enough that they just be present. Whilst obviously over simplifying - stating that the answer to 5 +3 = 10 will get you strung up from the light fittings for being obviously factually inaccurate. Stating that someone starred in a&nbsp; film when they didn't will lose you an arm or a leg in some venues, get the name wrong and you might never be asked back. Reliance on an outdated resource for quiz compiling might mean that your quiz is out of date too, and this could give rise to arguments amongst your quiz &nbsp;teams and disagreements when you come to present the answers. Remember people can divorce as well as marry, can cease to exist, and that something stated as fact, might only be accurate on the day it was initially written. Certainly the answer to "Who was the last man to walk on the moon?" might be considerably different in 100 years time.&nbsp;Normally the rule is that the players should aim to get the answer that the quiz master has on his answer sheet.

All well and good except the guy was a monotonous drone.<br /><br />First he took forever to start the quiz, flitting about, chatting to his friends in one of the teams - matey banter that was inappropriate and excluded everyone else.&nbsp;Nobody knew what was going on, or when.

He simply seemed to use it to address his table of mates in the corner, and seldom even turned to acknowledge the players in the next room.<br /><br />Again throughout the quiz he seemed to forget he was hosting, and lost himself in what he must have thought was amusing banter or flirting with his friends. Regular players started chatting amongst themselves and as a result no-one could hear the questions when he finally tried to deliver them.<br /><br />The evening drew on, and on and on and endlessly onwards, and we were still only half way through. Normally the quiz would have started about 9pm proper with a picture round followed by two rounds of ten questions each, a&nbsp;10-15 minute break for refreshments and nicotine addicts to gather sociably around the front door of the pub, and resumed with three more rounds. Finally after another break the answers would be read out, with the quiz wrapped up by about 10.20pm, leaving people to wind down for last orders, and to drift off home. But not on this night, we still had half the quiz to get through, before then revealing the answers and who had won.<br /><br />By this time several of us were ready to drag the old goat out, tie him to a tree and shoot him.<br /><br />Finally people started inevitably gathering their things and leaving before&nbsp;the quiz&nbsp;was over.

Others had just lost the will to live and didn't care any more.<br /><br />End result: a lot of regular quiz participants were irritated, pissed off and some likely to not come back.

Dig up a corpse at your peril.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Let the players know when you are going to start, how you will proceed, when you will take breaks for refreshments, and when you will be resuming with further rounds or the answers. Repeat this throughout the quiz so everyone knows what is going on, and just as importanntly, when.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Monotone delivery will&nbsp;at least put your players to sleep, if not utterly irritate them or push them into a coma.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Make sure everyone can hear you. Stage actors are taught to project their voices to the people furthest away from them, at the back of the theatre. Same principle here, everyone needs to hear you.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Pause briefly between questions, allowing the teams to discuss amongst themsleves and then answer the question, but dont leave it too long - you still have the rest of the quiz to get through!</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Start bumbling, farting about then people will get restless and agitated. As soon as this happens noise levels increase and your question delivery is lost amidst the hubbub. Keep a steady tempo and people will settle down to hear you read the questions, but if your delivery is constantly broken and irregular they will not know when to expect the next question.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Be clear, be concise, get on with it, you have several rounds to get through.&nbsp;Delivering the questions with authority means people will settle down to listen whilst you are speaking.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Remember you have an audience, so cut the cute&nbsp;banter with your mates. You are there for everybody, not just&nbsp;your table of favoured cronies in the corner. Have a bit of common courtesy. If you must share a joke, share it with everyone.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Don't dawdle. Remember that you may well have all evening to waste, but some people have jobs to get up for in the morning so bloody well get on with it, and don't keep people waiting forever while you fraternise with your mates. People came for the quiz, not to sit around waiting for you to get your shit together.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Summarise each round before and after. This punctuates proceedings nicely.&nbsp;This again lets the players know what to expect, and&nbsp;allows for&nbsp;the repetition of any questions. It also keeps you in control.</li></ul><br />Hopefully you have the good fortune of a great quiz master, with punchy, timely delivery and sound judgement. He will ensure that he is heard, and that everyone is treated fairly, and that no apparent favouritism is shown. Everyone will feel that they got the same opportunity to hear and answer the questions, and that he repeated any required without taking forever.<br /><br />Remember at your peril that you are supposed to be entertaining your customers and quiz participants, not trying to grate on their nerves or bore them to death...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;";s:4:"link";s:81:"http://pubsquiz.blogspot.com/2012/02/keep-it-punchy-mate-some-of-us-have-got.html";s:6:"author";s:33:"noreply@blogger.com (PubsQuizGuy)";s:7:"summary";s:7068:"Here is a lesson from the front line - keep your pub quiz delivery punchy and to the point.

Same principle here, everyone needs to hear you.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Pause briefly between questions, allowing the teams to discuss amongst themsleves and then answer the question, but dont leave it too long - you still have the rest of the quiz to get through!</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Start bumbling, farting about then people will get restless and agitated. As soon as this happens noise levels increase and your question delivery is lost amidst the hubbub. Keep a steady tempo and people will settle down to hear you read the questions, but if your delivery is constantly broken and irregular they will not know when to expect the next question.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Be clear, be concise, get on with it, you have several rounds to get through.&nbsp;Delivering the questions with authority means people will settle down to listen whilst you are speaking.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Remember you have an audience, so cut the cute&nbsp;banter with your mates. You are there for everybody, not just&nbsp;your table of favoured cronies in the corner. Have a bit of common courtesy. If you must share a joke, share it with everyone.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Don't dawdle. Remember that you may well have all evening to waste, but some people have jobs to get up for in the morning so bloody well get on with it, and don't keep people waiting forever while you fraternise with your mates. People came for the quiz, not to sit around waiting for you to get your shit together.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Summarise each round before and after. This punctuates proceedings nicely.&nbsp;This again lets the players know what to expect, and&nbsp;allows for&nbsp;the repetition of any questions. It also keeps you in control.</li></ul><br />Hopefully you have the good fortune of a great quiz master, with punchy, timely delivery and sound judgement. He will ensure that he is heard, and that everyone is treated fairly, and that no apparent favouritism is shown. Everyone will feel that they got the same opportunity to hear and answer the questions, and that he repeated any required without taking forever.<br /><br />Remember at your peril that you are supposed to be entertaining your customers and quiz participants, not trying to grate on their nerves or bore them to death...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1328169600;}i:12;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995172155813055775.post-7670754791994593848";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 21:42:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:52:"bingo quizpub quizpub quiz typequiz typesweekly quiz";s:5:"title";s:20:"Bingo Style Pub Quiz";s:11:"description";s:4376:"The majority of pub quizzes take the regular form, of several rounds of questions on specific topics, such as music, television, film and sports.

For example, ?We asked 100 people to name a well known astronaut?. The emphasis is less about what the ?correct? answer is, but what the people surveyed might have said. Depending on the demographics, answers might range from the obvious answers like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the ridiculous but popular such as Buzz Lightyear!</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Alternatively true or false rounds on totally obscure facts might also provide the right level of challenge. Also questions which rely on an aggregation of information such as "How many films has Tom Hanks appeared in which won oscars?" will stretch even the most adept internet nerd. <br /><br />A skilled quizmaster will be able to rise to the challenge and find questions to test the best brains rather than the best technology.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #20124d;"><strong><u>Share Your Experiences</u></strong></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">So what are your experiences of mobile phone cheating?
