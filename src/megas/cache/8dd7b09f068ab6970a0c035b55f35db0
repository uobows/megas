<p><strong>Loving Her At Last: The Girl</strong><br />
By Sharon Doubiago</p>
<p>My fifteen year old self, naked<br />
walked into the room awhile ago<br />
here on 64 Elgin Park, San Francisco</p>
<p>She just came in, moved around, then sat on the edge of the bed,<br />
the first time I?ve seen her since back then.<br />
I didn?t move for fear she?d disappear<br />
though she was so ominous<br />
that seemed impossible</p>
<p>Eidolon, her breasts<br />
were blue-veined beneath white marble.<br />
I smelled her. I could have touched her blue-veined muscled thigh.<br />
I was breathing inside her. I was<br />
bleeding</p>
<p>I saw for the first time that she was beautiful.<br />
She who had made me so miserable, a spectacle, a freak<br />
her body her thoughts her heart her presence<br />
I?ve fled ever since</p>
<p>I had not realized my impoverished self, the state<br />
of my soul until she walked into this room.<br />
I had not realized how much I had aged<br />
but in she walked, o my<br />
in perfect preservation</p>
<p>just hiding all this time.<br />
Moved around for my observation<br />
as if she?d never left<br />
*<br />
(for Sharon Lura Edens, for all young women)</p>
<p><strong>The Boy</strong><br />
By Sharon Doubiago</p>
<p>I dream the boy again.<br />
He lies on his back on the blanketed ground<br />
in a tent west of Julian in that convoluted land<br />
Vulcan, Mesa Grande, mountains<br />
erupting, ravines splitting open<br />
I?m kneeling at your head, my family<br />
gathered behind me, watching to make sure<br />
you take your last breath. I note<br />
the slight bulge in your white pants</p>
<p>and when you die I touch you. Very lightly<br />
your left arm. And come awake</p>
<p>in grief, shock, dread, in sex, my body<br />
exploding our collective sorrow, but the horror too<br />
suffered separately by each of us who?s ever loved</p>
<p>this procession of ridges that twist and turn</p>
<p>an adolescent boy, a boy I don?t recognize. A boy<br />
I?ve dreamed ever since. The first boy I loved, the boy<br />
I am, the boy I deserted</p>
<p>dead at the bottom of the ravine<br />
filled to the top now with all the boys and girls</p>
<p>every boy?s required divorce from love<br />
to become a man</p>
<p>though in the rock paintings<br />
an erection on a body lying on the battlefield means<br />
the boy comes back to life<br />
* (for Ryan, for all young men)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recipe For Peace</strong><br />
By Devreaux Baker</p>
<p>Bare your feet, roll up your sleeves<br />
oil the immigrant?s bowl.<br />
Open the doors and windows of your house<br />
invite in the neighbors, invite in strangers off the street.<br />
Roll out the dough, add the spices for a good life;<br />
cardamom and soul, cumin and tears.<br />
Stir in sesame and sorrow, a dash of salt<br />
pink as new hope.<br />
Rub marjoram and thyme, lemon grass and holy basil<br />
on your fingers and pat the dough.<br />
Bless the table, bless the bread,<br />
bless your hands and feet.<br />
Bless the neighbors and strangers<br />
off the street.<br />
Bake the bread for a century or more<br />
on a moderate heat<br />
under the olive trees in your back yard<br />
or on the sun-filled stones of Syria.<br />
In the white rocks of Beirut<br />
or behind the walls of Jerusalem.<br />
In the mountains of Afghanistan<br />
and in the sky scrapers of New York.<br />
Feast with all the migrant tongues<br />
until your mouth understands<br />
the taste of many different homes<br />
and your belly is full so you fall asleep<br />
cradled in the skirts of the world<br />
curled in the lap of peace.</p>

<p>Poetry after the jump:</p>
<p><span id="more-2767"></span></p>
<p><strong>An Old Man Carrying His Catheter Bag<br />
</strong>By Kevin Simmonds</p>
<p>white-haired vapor<br />
in khakis<br />
shuffling down a street</p>
<p>held it waist high<br />
a flag<br />
signaling the body<br />
<em><br />
solid   liquid   gas</em><br />
the body comes<br />
to all three</p>
<p>I am bile<br />
as I am wit<br />
I drink to live in this body</p>
<p>See to it that you revere<br />
this gold<br />
this gold</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>High Above</strong><br />
&#8211; for those who chose to leap<br />
By Chun Yu</p>
<p>He stood on a tall chimney<br />
looking down on the crowd below<br />
a bottle of alcohol in one hand<br />
a bag of sugar in the other ?<br />
the rarest in the year of starvation<br />
bought with the money<br />
Mother made from weaving baskets.</p>
<p>The mass below moved<br />
squirming<br />
eyes like fallen stars<br />
scattered in the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>Mother<br />
the dusk sun in the distance<br />
once shined<br />
with a thousand lights<br />
already gone.</p>
<p>He, the brilliant life<br />
who has spoken a thought<br />
is about to be forsaken<br />
on a chimney built from<br />
ten thousand red bricks<br />
was looked up to<br />
by the crowd below<br />
in ten thousand thoughts<br />
silenced.</p>
<p>In his eyes<br />
the world had fallen into darkness.<br />
Looking up to the sky<br />
he knows, with one leap<br />
he will be a star next to the moon.</p>
<p>His life can no longer<br />
be taken by human force<br />
or saved by its conscience</p>
<p>which, however<br />
will carry the bricks<br />
even when the force is gone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brian-christian.com/bio-contact/"><strong>Brian Christian</strong></a> is the author of <em>The Most Human Human</em>, which was named a Wall Street Journal bestseller and a New Yorker favorite book of the year.  Christian has been featured on The Daily Show, Radiolab, and The Charlie Rose Show, and his work has won several awards, including fellowships at Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony. Check out his latest book, <em><a href="https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3232352093_algorithms_to_live_by">Algorithms to Live By</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What are you reading right now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I recently started Sarah Schulman?s <em>The Gentrification of the Mind</em>, a book which I learned about the old-fashioned way: by shamelessly eavesdropping on two readers discussing it at the table next to mine over brunch.</p>
<p><strong><em>Who, currently, are your favorite living poets?</em></strong></p>
<p>I was so stunned to hear of C. D. Wright?s passing, and I still can?t quite come to terms with that. Forrest Gander was my mentor at Brown and my gateway drug to contemporary poetry. Ben Lerner is electric on the page, and I devour his novels but hope we haven?t seen the last of his verse. Arthur Sze?s work is somehow both meditative and haunting, an unusual combination, in the best of ways.</p>
<p><strong><em>Which poet of past would you most like to share a drink with? </em></strong></p>
<p>Maybe this is cheating, but my first thought is Eliot, because the rest of the Lost Generation would probably be drinking with him. Also because I?d be in Paris. In the 20s.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you envision libraries in the future?</em></strong></p>
<p>I?m reminded of the quote by Thoreau about college. &#8220;Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made.?</p>
<p>I agree: while the lectures were what I ostensibly paid for, the real value was in the one-to-one off-hours mentorship of several of my advisers, and even more so in the fellowship of my peers?both of which were ostensibly free. Through this lens, I take a skeptical view of the online education movement, though I do think people around the world benefit from better access to information.</p>
<p>This is how I think of the future of the library as well. Mentorship and fellowship will require physical spaces whether or not the consumption of information does. In these the institution of the library has a unique and important role to play?now and for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong><em>What projects are you working on right now?</em></strong></p>
<p>Last month was the publication of my second book of nonfiction, a collaboration with a good friend of mine, Tom Griffiths. The book is called <em>Algorithms to Live By</em> and uses computer science as a lens for thinking about human decision-making. In short, we think of things like choosing between our favorite things and new ones, wrangling mess, and managing time as uniquely human problems. They?re not. I?m extremely proud of it and can?t wait to see it make its way to readers? hands and minds.</p>

<p><strong>The Chronicles of the Skin</strong><br />
By Mauro Aprile Zanetti</p>
<p>1. We were asleep. Around ten pm,</p>
<p>then we heard a whistle, kinda big bang,</p>
<p>Enkidu roaring with a clang or Gilgamesh:</p>
<p>and it all happened so fast: as a light, as a thunder, a blast!</p>
<p>We collapsed, and I was shouting for help</p>
<p>after the clash of the bones and stones and hearts,</p>
<p>and only to find that other people were also in need of help,</p>
<p>oh people, how many left deaf, biting the dust!</p>
<p>2. And, I then realized:</p>
<p>my brothers and cousins all dead.</p>
<p>They were forty, and now they are dead.</p>
<p>My grandfather&#8217;s house, a tomb:</p>
<p>destroyed by an incandescent iron &#8211; oh bomb!</p>
<p>My grandmother was torn to four pieces in the air;</p>
<p>my aunt is missing, and nieces, with loose hair.</p>
<p>And still I do want to still understand</p>
<p>why you are attacking us, oh man!</p>
<p>Is it survival of the strongest?</p>
<p>Just like that? Like that? Like that?</p>
<p>3. Houses torn down like they are paper:</p>
<p>my cousins were all young,</p>
<p>and one of them was praying</p>
<p>when it happened.</p>
<p>They smelled good even after they had died</p>
<p>and they were smiling, smelling deaths, died</p>
<p>when we were shouting for their bodies with our bodies:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria&#8221;.</p>
<p>4. And my cousin? he also had a son who had died;</p>
<p>and a pregnant woman in her ninth month:</p>
<p>a pregnant death giving no more birth, but calling for death;</p>
<p>and her husband who saved money to be prepared<br />
for her giving birth, the birth, a birth, oh my second birth.</p>
<p>Gone, they are all gone!</p>
<p>5. What else could I tell you?</p>
<p>About my cousin Giufà?</p>
<p>His father lost his mind after he had died, alas Giufà!</p>
<p>Now a father sleeps next to his son&#8217;s grave.</p>
<p>No right, no left, close to less than a grave</p>
<p>to guard his own son and greet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allwombing tomb, omniwomb, his mouth&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is no longer sane, no longer with brains.</p>
<p>Something fell apart with his head.</p>
<p>And it all happened like it all was an earthquake:</p>
<p>we didn&#8217;t see anything, not a break.</p>
<p>I was hit and had lost consciousness,</p>
<p>and fortunately not my wheelchair.<br />
And to my father, who is sensitive,</p>
<p>I had told him I was not harmed,</p>
<p>but rather swamped by a Leviathan of awareness.</p>
<p>6. My mother, majestic in her mountain pose,</p>
<p>resurrected from the rubble, went on dispensing endearment:</p>
<p>hope, fables, lullabies, and tenderness for all of us kids &#8211;</p>
<p>ill-concealing her blown up teeth</p>
<p>with her bleeding hand, doing voices for us &#8211;</p>
<p>she was dispensing smiles, care and caresses,</p>
<p>while trying with her trembling eyes to recompose</p>
<p>the landscape of the seasons of a whole life.</p>
<p>7. And so we carried on helping other people over there.</p>
<p>They were good people, still dreaming in their own stony sleep:</p>
<p>their houses in huge despair,</p>
<p>and those people, who were helping,</p>
<p>they needed help for themselves, waste.<br />
Our world is a handful of whitish silent dust.</p>
<p>8. Son, which is your people?</p>
<p>Oh mirror, where do you come from, kid?</p>
<p>And what about your skin?</p>
<p>Which race do you belong to, little sun?</p>
<p>What is your faith, pal?</p>
<p>9. Sir, I come from the Earth, that blue planet, Madonna-blue.</p>
<p>And I do belong to that one-and-only race</p>
<p>which is only a human trace.</p>
<p>My people is the upcoming people, voilà!</p>
<p>Made up of my skin&#8217;s atoms for another hurrah!</p>
<p>My faith is you, oh dear:</p>
<p>hypocrite lecteur, mon semblable, mon frère!</p>
