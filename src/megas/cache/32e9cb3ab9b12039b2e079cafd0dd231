<p>Funding will support two new research fellowships within the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) at the University of Technology Sydney, led by Professor of Public Health Jon Adams.</p>
<p>ARCCIM is a world-leading critical public health and health services research centre focusing on traditional, complementary and integrative health care and brings together experts in epidemiology and health economics. Its work has received substantial government funding, including prestigious research fellowships from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC). Professor Adams is an ARC Professorial Future Fellow.</p>
<p>Half of the $1.5 million donation will come from Marcus Blackmore?s personal philanthropic trust, the Blackmore Foundation. Mr Blackmore, who recently became the first Australian to be inducted into the US Natural Products Hall of Legends, says: ?My commitment to naturopathy and natural health therapies has been life-long as has my passion for research into complementary medicines and, in particular, naturopathy. Australia is regarded as a world leader in this research, largely due to the work of centres like ARCCIM. I look forward to seeing the results of this ongoing research.?</p>

</div>
<p>?This new support will help us grow critical and rigorous public health research into the opportunities and challenges of therapies like naturopathy,? says Professor Adams. ?It will help us answer important research questions such as the reasons people use naturopathy and other complementary medicines, how they make decisions about the medicines and the therapies they use and how practitioners such as naturopaths connect and communicate with mainstream hospital and primary care systems.?</p>
<p>These and other questions are important as we face major challenges that include an ageing population, chronic illness and a health system under stress, says Eyal Wolstin, Managing Director of BioCeuticals. ?The complementary and integrative medicine landscape involves an array of medicines and practitioners and the work of ARCCIM will help to build the broad evidence base needed to inform policy development this significant area of health care.?</p>
<p>Marcus Blackmore agrees: ?Our involvement in this donation is a reflection of our unswerving and ongoing responsibility and obligation to finding the most efficacious and evidence-based approaches for practitioners and their patients. This research will be Australia-focused, national in scale and independent, since the centre will design and apply it as it sees fit.?</p>
<p>Professor Prasuna Reddy, Associate Dean, International and Advancement, UTS Faculty of Health, says: ?This kind of industry support for independent scientific research enhances the ability of centres like ARCCIM to do pioneering work. It will help drive our understanding of what happens in the real world and help shape practice.?</p>
<p>Health Minister Greg Hunt commended investment by individuals and companies into Australian health research saying: ?People like Marcus Blackmore and the team at BioCeuticals are making a significant contribution through their funding of Australian research centres, giving us a better understanding of natural therapies.</p>
<p>?Medical research creates a pathway to better healthcare which ultimately benefits the entire community,? says the Minister.</p>

Over 95 per cent of TB cases and deaths occur in developing countries.</p>
<p>Chancellors Postdoctoral Research Fellow (CPDRF) Dr Nilesh Bokil is no stranger to the damaging effects of TB. </p>
<p>Nilesh remembers the lingering effects TB had on his grandmother: "She wasn't able to fly, she wasn't able to go anywhere. Towards the end of her life, she was bed-ridden, and as winter rolled around, her condition would get worse."  </p>
<p>As a 2018 CPDRF, Nilesh is now embarking on a four-year research project to develop new microRNA-based therapeutic treatments against the inflammation caused by TB. </p>

<p>So, <a href="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2018/03/dna-rna-and-microrna">what are microRNA</a>? You'll be forgiven for missing the memo: "MicroRNA were only discovered in the 90s," explains Nilesh. ?When cells need to get something done, RNA ? which is a copy of the cell?s DNA ? is produced. This RNA is then translated to proteins for things to work.</p>
<p>?MicroRNA are small RNA molecules that don?t actually code for proteins but are involved in regulating the conversion of other RNA into protein. By doing so, they can regulate important cell functions including inflammation.</p>
<p>Because they were so recently discovered, the specific details of how they work, what they do, and what areas they target are up in the air. But, says Nilesh, ?We know they're important physiologically because when you get rid of some of them, it affects multiple body functions including the immune system." </p>
<p>Nilesh is focussing on the effects of these infinitesimally small molecules to help control the effects of TB, which can include extensive scarring of the lungs. He hopes to deliver real changes to those affected by TB. </p>
<p>He says, "The problem with TB and treatment in general, is that you have to take a minimum of six months? of antibiotics to get better.? But before and during treatment your lungs are inflamed and healthy tissue is being damaged.</p>
<p>"So you may be cured at the end of six months, and have no bacteria in the lungs, but you'll never get that damaged tissue back.</p>
<p>"I've dealt with people who have been cured but who are left with just 40 per cent lung capacity. And, in developing countries the majority of people who get TB are of working age ? imagine going back to work as a manual labourer, for example, with 40 per cent lung capacity. You can?t breathe, you have little energy, it?s debilitating." </p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>If we are successful, it is going to have an effect on the social structure of communities, not just the medical sector</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>It?s situations like this, says Nilesh, that fostered his special interest in inflammatory and infectious diseases, and made him realise the urgent need for new therapies to treat them. Though his first stage of research is underway, Nilesh says he has at least four years in front of him trying to identify which microRNA will be most relevant and then develop potential therapeutics.</p>
<p>"We have samples of patients who are either healthy or who are suffering from the disease," explains Nilesh, "If we can identify which microRNA are altered, not only can we use that information for developing therapeutics, but we can also use that for the early diagnosis of TB.</p>
<p>"If we are successful, it is going to have an effect on the social structure of communities, not just the medical sector," says Nilesh.</p>
<p>"Most of the countries affected are in the developing world: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Nigeria. And a bigger problem associated with this is that HIV is also prevalent in these countries and people living with HIV are 20 to 30 times more susceptible to TB than people without HIV."  </p>
<p>Nilesh hopes to use his research as the starting point for identifying therapeutic applications of microRNA modulation for other inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and cirrhosis. </p>
<p>"This fellowship gives me the chance to not have to worry about publishing quotas and producing results on a yearly basis," he says. "I think that's important for getting early- and mid-career scientists to start thinking about long-term projects. Sometimes the most impactful publications or developments can be a culmination of four to five years' work, so this freedom is very valuable." </p>
<p>As a 2018 CPDRF, Nilesh will also be teaching and mentoring UTS students. He's is in a unique position to share his real-world perspective on the science they're learning. "I'm keen to teach into and develop courses at UTS that will give students an understanding of the translational effects of research that is done not only at UTS, but across Australia and around the world.?</p>

<p><strong>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)</strong> contains the biological instructions that make each species unique. These instructions are passed on from adults to offspring which is how traits like black hair, or blue eyes are passed on.</p>
<p>DNA molecules are tightly packaged together and this bundled form of the DNA is called a chromosome. The complete DNA instruction book, or genome, for a human contains about three billion bases and about 20,000 genes on 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce, but these instructions need to be enacted by something else.</p>
<p>DNA sequences are translated into messages ? or <strong>RNA (ribonucleic acid)</strong> ? that can be used to produce proteins, which are the molecules that do most of the work in the body. The RNA copies of the DNA are actually responsible for controlling what?s happening in the cells.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Six months after the explosive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">allegations of sexual harassment</a> against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light, giving impetus to the #MeToo movement, this series looks at the aftermath of the movement, and if it has brought about lasting change to sexual harassment and gender equality.</em></p>
<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The #MeToo movement has generated much needed discussion about inappropriate sexual behaviour and what constitutes consent to any sexual encounter. Despite some backlash, there is a sense women have reached a new level of agitation that won?t settle. The groundswell of anger might be sufficient to sustain a deep dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</p>
<p>But such cultural revolutions require change at many levels, from the interpersonal to the institutional. Young people are important in this revolution ? many are leaders of the movement. Others need the knowledge and skills to recognise and interpret signals, and assert their own positions within the complex, often confusing situations that require sexual negotiation and consent.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-is-not-enough-it-has-yet-to-shift-the-power-imbalances-that-would-bring-about-gender-equality-92108">#MeToo is not enough: it has yet to shift the power imbalances that would bring about gender equality</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>These are learned informally from parents, carers, peers and the media. Formal school education is <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/148060/Sexual-Education-in-Australia-2011.pdf">widely accepted</a> as one of the appropriate institutions for teaching children and adolescents about relationships, sexual and reproductive health, and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Post-#MeToo, teachers who are already engaged in skills-building in the area of consent might explore its nuances. They might delve deeper into sexual harassment and what it looks and feels like. And help shift young people?s understanding that consent is not just about (mainly) girls saying ?no?, but also (mainly) boys understanding ?yes?.</p>
<h2>The importance of sexuality education</h2>
<p>This year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) published a <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf">revised version</a> of their 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education.</p>
<p>This report summarises decades of evidence of the positive impact comprehensive sexuality education has on measurable aspects of sexual behaviour. These include delaying commencement of sexual intercourse, reducing the number of partners and increasing use of contraception and condom use.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/good-sex-ed-doesnt-lead-to-teen-pregnancy-it-prevents-it-60036">Good sex ed doesn't lead to teen pregnancy, it prevents it</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Other desirable outcomes, such as less gender discrimination and gender-based violence, and healthy relationships, have been less rigorously studied. But these are also likely to be positively impacted by comprehensive sexuality education.</p>
<h2>Teaching consent</h2>
<p>In Australia, the principles of sexuality education are covered by the national <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/health-and-physical-education/?year=12993&amp;year=12994&amp;year=12995&amp;year=12996&amp;year=12997&amp;year=12998&amp;strand=Personal%2C+Social+and+Community+Health&amp;strand=Movement+and+Physical+Activity&amp;capability=ignore&amp;capability=Literacy&amp;capability=Numeracy&amp;capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&amp;capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&amp;capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&amp;capability=Ethical+Understanding&amp;capability=Intercultural+Understanding&amp;priority=ignore&amp;priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&amp;priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&amp;priority=Sustainability&amp;elaborations=true&amp;elaborations=false&amp;scotterms=false&amp;isFirstPageLoad=false">Health and Physical Education</a> curriculum. This includes a range of topics broadly classified as aspects of consent.</p>
<p>As early as kindergarten, the curriculum areas include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Understanding in what situations parts of the body should be kept private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognising one?s own emotions and learning how to express them, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able to name people you trust and places you feel safe.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As the curriculum progresses through primary and secondary school, these themes continue. Attention is paid to understanding the body as it develops, recognising emotion, exploring empathy and respectful relationships, particularly between peers.</p>
<p>During the mid-adolescent years, risk-taking behaviours and peer influences are a <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2014/201/10/health-emerging-adults-australia-freedom-risk-and-rites-passage">natural feature of development</a>. At this point, the curriculum articulates the need for students to learn ?practising skills to deal with challenging or unsafe situations? and ?asserting their stance on a situation, dilemma or decision ??</p>

<p>All states and territories will adopt or use the national curriculum as a basis to develop their own health and physical education syllabuses, where additional detail can be found. For example, in New South Wales, the <a href="http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/pdhpe/pdhpe-7-10">current syllabus for years seven to ten</a> (circa 2003) explicitly discusses teaching the role gender can play in a range of attitudes, behaviours and health outcomes.</p>
<p>Power in relationships is also specifically mentioned. So too is a detailed list of learning outcomes about communication, assertiveness and negotiation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/4ba7e0bb-b518-4868-976c-bd49fb802fd8/PDHPE+K-10+Draft+Syllabus+2017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=">new draft NSW syllabus</a> mentions the word consent in three places in years seven and eight, and years nine and ten. But this is done in the broad context of ethical relationships, not specifically sexual.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/introduction/rationale-and-aims">Victorian curriculum</a> (circa 2016) also articulates principles of respect and ethics in relationships and discusses power and gender. A search through the health curricula of other states and territories finds similar themes.</p>
<p>The average age of first intercourse among <a href="https://members.youthcoalition.net/sites/default/files/articles-external/National%20Survey%20of%20Australian%20Secondary%20Students%20and%20Sexual%20Health.pdf">Australian secondary students is 16 years</a>. But by this time, the majority have experienced some form of (non-penetrative) sexual activity. It?s reassuring that notions of consent appear in the early secondary years alongside learning about personal boundaries, recognising one?s own emotions, and communication skills.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/bringing-pleasure-into-the-discussion-about-sexting-among-teens-92425">Bringing pleasure into the discussion about sexting among teens</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Despite most sexually active secondary students reporting that they have had pleasurable sexual experiences (an important indicator of sexual health), a high proportion consistently report having had unwanted intercourse, with significant gender differences. In 2013, our <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/576661/ARCSHS-SSASH-2013.pdf">five-yearly national survey</a> found 28% of female students had had unwanted sex compared to 19% of males.</p>
<p>Intoxication was a common reason (around 50%) for all students, but for females, pressure from a partner was the most common, at 61%. Being frightened was cited by 34%.</p>
<p>About 300 health and physical education teachers in public, independent and Catholic schools across Australia were <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/135450/SexEducationinAustSecondarySchools2010-1-5-2011.pdf">surveyed</a> in 2011. A whopping 89.6% indicated they had taught communication and negotiation skills with a partner. The evidence looks promising ? although ?consent? is not specifically named, it is implied.</p>
<h2>Will #MeToo help?</h2>
<p>Our national curriculum and state syllabuses refer specifically to gender-based and sexual violence and abuse. It is not surprising, however, that despite best intentions, school curricula and quality classroom teaching alone are not sufficient to prevent them.</p>
<p>Perhaps #MeToo will be a signpost, a guide to future classroom discussions. It?s noteworthy that the NSW Minister for Education, Rob Stokes, and Premier Gladys Berejiklian <a href="https://www.theeducatoronline.com/au/news/what-the-metoo-campaign-means-for-schools/245829">made statements</a> that the #MeToo movement provided new opportunities for teachers to have ?open and frank? conversations with students.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/we-have-marriage-equality-now-we-need-lgbtqi-inclusive-sexuality-education-in-schools-87501">We have marriage equality, now we need LGBTQi+-inclusive sexuality education in schools</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>This will involve conversations about the building blocks of respect. Teachers and students need to examine why women and their bodies are still objectified despite four waves of feminism. They might also explore the unconscious ways sexism writes the sexual scripts that children and adolescents learn.</p>
<p>This is rich material for many subject curricula, and our teachers have the skills to do this well. It?s only one component of the revolution, but playing an active part is surely what lies at the heart of the #MeToo movement.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Six months after the explosive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">allegations of sexual harassment</a> against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light, giving impetus to the #MeToo movement, this series looks at the aftermath of the movement, and if it has brought about lasting change to sexual harassment and gender equality.</em></p>
<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The #MeToo movement has generated much needed discussion about inappropriate sexual behaviour and what constitutes consent to any sexual encounter. Despite some backlash, there is a sense women have reached a new level of agitation that won?t settle. The groundswell of anger might be sufficient to sustain a deep dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</p>
<p>But such cultural revolutions require change at many levels, from the interpersonal to the institutional. Young people are important in this revolution ? many are leaders of the movement. Others need the knowledge and skills to recognise and interpret signals, and assert their own positions within the complex, often confusing situations that require sexual negotiation and consent.</p>

<hr /><p>These are learned informally from parents, carers, peers and the media. Formal school education is <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/148060/Sexual-Education-in-Australia-2011.pdf">widely accepted</a> as one of the appropriate institutions for teaching children and adolescents about relationships, sexual and reproductive health, and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Post-#MeToo, teachers who are already engaged in skills-building in the area of consent might explore its nuances. They might delve deeper into sexual harassment and what it looks and feels like. And help shift young people?s understanding that consent is not just about (mainly) girls saying ?no?, but also (mainly) boys understanding ?yes?.</p>
<h2>The importance of sexuality education</h2>
<p>This year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) published a <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf">revised version</a> of their 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education.</p>
<p>This report summarises decades of evidence of the positive impact comprehensive sexuality education has on measurable aspects of sexual behaviour. These include delaying commencement of sexual intercourse, reducing the number of partners and increasing use of contraception and condom use.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/good-sex-ed-doesnt-lead-to-teen-pregnancy-it-prevents-it-60036">Good sex ed doesn't lead to teen pregnancy, it prevents it</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Other desirable outcomes, such as less gender discrimination and gender-based violence, and healthy relationships, have been less rigorously studied. But these are also likely to be positively impacted by comprehensive sexuality education.</p>
<h2>Teaching consent</h2>
<p>In Australia, the principles of sexuality education are covered by the national <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/health-and-physical-education/?year=12993&amp;year=12994&amp;year=12995&amp;year=12996&amp;year=12997&amp;year=12998&amp;strand=Personal%2C+Social+and+Community+Health&amp;strand=Movement+and+Physical+Activity&amp;capability=ignore&amp;capability=Literacy&amp;capability=Numeracy&amp;capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&amp;capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&amp;capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&amp;capability=Ethical+Understanding&amp;capability=Intercultural+Understanding&amp;priority=ignore&amp;priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&amp;priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&amp;priority=Sustainability&amp;elaborations=true&amp;elaborations=false&amp;scotterms=false&amp;isFirstPageLoad=false">Health and Physical Education</a> curriculum. This includes a range of topics broadly classified as aspects of consent.</p>
<p>As early as kindergarten, the curriculum areas include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Understanding in what situations parts of the body should be kept private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognising one?s own emotions and learning how to express them, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able to name people you trust and places you feel safe.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As the curriculum progresses through primary and secondary school, these themes continue. Attention is paid to understanding the body as it develops, recognising emotion, exploring empathy and respectful relationships, particularly between peers.</p>
<p>During the mid-adolescent years, risk-taking behaviours and peer influences are a <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2014/201/10/health-emerging-adults-australia-freedom-risk-and-rites-passage">natural feature of development</a>. At this point, the curriculum articulates the need for students to learn ?practising skills to deal with challenging or unsafe situations? and ?asserting their stance on a situation, dilemma or decision ??</p>
<p><figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a> <figcaption><span class="caption">Young people are playing an important role in dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKw4eamvjKA">Photo by Nicole Adams on Unsplash</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>All states and territories will adopt or use the national curriculum as a basis to develop their own health and physical education syllabuses, where additional detail can be found. For example, in New South Wales, the <a href="http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/pdhpe/pdhpe-7-10">current syllabus for years seven to ten</a> (circa 2003) explicitly discusses teaching the role gender can play in a range of attitudes, behaviours and health outcomes.</p>
<p>Power in relationships is also specifically mentioned. So too is a detailed list of learning outcomes about communication, assertiveness and negotiation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/4ba7e0bb-b518-4868-976c-bd49fb802fd8/PDHPE+K-10+Draft+Syllabus+2017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=">new draft NSW syllabus</a> mentions the word consent in three places in years seven and eight, and years nine and ten. But this is done in the broad context of ethical relationships, not specifically sexual.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/introduction/rationale-and-aims">Victorian curriculum</a> (circa 2016) also articulates principles of respect and ethics in relationships and discusses power and gender. A search through the health curricula of other states and territories finds similar themes.</p>
<p>The average age of first intercourse among <a href="https://members.youthcoalition.net/sites/default/files/articles-external/National%20Survey%20of%20Australian%20Secondary%20Students%20and%20Sexual%20Health.pdf">Australian secondary students is 16 years</a>. But by this time, the majority have experienced some form of (non-penetrative) sexual activity. It?s reassuring that notions of consent appear in the early secondary years alongside learning about personal boundaries, recognising one?s own emotions, and communication skills.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/bringing-pleasure-into-the-discussion-about-sexting-among-teens-92425">Bringing pleasure into the discussion about sexting among teens</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Despite most sexually active secondary students reporting that they have had pleasurable sexual experiences (an important indicator of sexual health), a high proportion consistently report having had unwanted intercourse, with significant gender differences. In 2013, our <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/576661/ARCSHS-SSASH-2013.pdf">five-yearly national survey</a> found 28% of female students had had unwanted sex compared to 19% of males.</p>
<p>Intoxication was a common reason (around 50%) for all students, but for females, pressure from a partner was the most common, at 61%. Being frightened was cited by 34%.</p>
<p>About 300 health and physical education teachers in public, independent and Catholic schools across Australia were <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/135450/SexEducationinAustSecondarySchools2010-1-5-2011.pdf">surveyed</a> in 2011. A whopping 89.6% indicated they had taught communication and negotiation skills with a partner. The evidence looks promising ? although ?consent? is not specifically named, it is implied.</p>
<h2>Will #MeToo help?</h2>
<p>Our national curriculum and state syllabuses refer specifically to gender-based and sexual violence and abuse. It is not surprising, however, that despite best intentions, school curricula and quality classroom teaching alone are not sufficient to prevent them.</p>
<p>Perhaps #MeToo will be a signpost, a guide to future classroom discussions. It?s noteworthy that the NSW Minister for Education, Rob Stokes, and Premier Gladys Berejiklian <a href="https://www.theeducatoronline.com/au/news/what-the-metoo-campaign-means-for-schools/245829">made statements</a> that the #MeToo movement provided new opportunities for teachers to have ?open and frank? conversations with students.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/we-have-marriage-equality-now-we-need-lgbtqi-inclusive-sexuality-education-in-schools-87501">We have marriage equality, now we need LGBTQi+-inclusive sexuality education in schools</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>This will involve conversations about the building blocks of respect. Teachers and students need to examine why women and their bodies are still objectified despite four waves of feminism. They might also explore the unconscious ways sexism writes the sexual scripts that children and adolescents learn.</p>
<p>This is rich material for many subject curricula, and our teachers have the skills to do this well. It?s only one component of the revolution, but playing an active part is surely what lies at the heart of the #MeToo movement.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Stephen Hawking was one of the most prominent people in history to use a high-tech communication aid known as <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/english/what-is-aac/">augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/stephen-hawking-dies-aged-76/9547454">His death</a> comes in the year of the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17549507.2018.1428687">70th Anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Over the course of his adult life, Hawking came to represent the epitome of what effective communication with AAC systems really means: gaining access to the human right of communication enshrined in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p>
<p>Today, many Australians who need AAC <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Speech_Pathology/Report">still lack access to the technology</a> and the support they need to use it. It?s time for that to change.</p>
<h2>How augmentative and alternative communication works</h2>
<p>To most people who can speak, AAC systems are a bit of a mystery ? it?s not always clear how the person using it is controlling the system. Indeed, people?s fascination with how a speech device works often overtakes their attention to what the person is actually saying.</p>
<p><figure></figure></p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8erfGhAHVY4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="440"></iframe><p></p>
<p>AAC includes sign and gesture systems, communication boards, speech-generating devices, mobile phones with apps, and even emojis and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17549507.2017.1413137">social media</a>. Ultimately it works not only through the interaction of the user with their device, but also through their interactions with communication partners.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/stephen-hawking-as-accidental-ambassador-for-assistive-technologies-70627">Stephen Hawking as accidental ambassador for assistive technologies</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Some types of AAC don?t involve technology at all, but use the person?s body, such as sign or gesture systems. Some AAC systems are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583966">non-electronic</a>, like communication boards, books, or wallets for people to point to or look at letters, words or phrases to communicate. Other types of AAC are known as ?high-tech?, in that they involve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaLjMWbAnSw">electronic systems and computer-based technologies</a> to both store and retrieve words for communication.</p>
<p>Apart from the time taken to compose a message, it can take hours to program what could be spoken using a communication aid ? and many more to ensure that the desired words can be found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10882-015-9452-2">just in time</a> for communication.</p>
<p>Hawking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UErbwiJH1dI">used a switch to control software on a computer</a> that enabled him to talk. This kind of switch allows users to scan through options shown on the screen until they reach the letter, word or message to select for the device to ?speak?.</p>
<h2>Realising the potential of people with communication disability</h2>
<p>Hawking did not tend to use his platform in relation to <a href="https://theconversation.com/stephen-hawking-as-accidental-ambassador-for-assistive-technologies-70627">disability</a>, but when he did his words were significant. In writing the <a href="http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf">foreword to the World Report on Disability in 2011</a>, he highlighted the importance of people with disability having access to the equipment that they need, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>?we have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr /><p>A patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, Hawking inspired millions of people around the world with the condition. His lifetime achievement as a person who uses AAC was recognised by the <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Stephen-Hawking-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-announcement-FINAL.pdf">International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication</a>.</p>
<p>Although he hoped to be remembered more for his science than for his popular appearances on The Simpsons, his character delivered a vital line on communication rights and the need for AAC with a firm directive: ?Silence. I don?t need anyone to talk for me except this voice box.?</p>

<p>His call to ?look up at the stars?, should further compel AAC users and communication technologists to work together and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220802387851">reach for the stars</a> in finding solutions for people who cannot rely on speech to communicate.</p>

<h2>People who use AAC need to have a say in the design process</h2>
<p>Hawking?s fame attracted the world?s best and brightest to work with him to solve problems around the use of communication technologies. But AAC systems still don?t stop people from ?<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225183732_Slipping_Through_the_Timestream_Social_Issues_of_Time_and_Timing_in_Augmented_Interactions">slipping through the timestream</a>? of conversation. Communication using AAC systems is slow and effortful.</p>
<p>It can be hard to make a comment in a conversation ? by the time the person has got the attention of other speakers and composed their message, the conversation has moved on, and the message is delivered ?out of time?. It?s a puzzle to find systems that improve the timing and flow of talk, to match each user?s communication needs.</p>

Like the famous film critic <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_ebert_remaking_my_voice">Roger Ebert before him</a>, he had the final say on his own vocal identity.</p>
<p>Hawking?s empowered story highlights the importance of designers not allowing ableist notions of an acceptable voice to restrict an AAC user?s self-expression. His stance also reflects the importance of people who use AAC co-designing AAC systems that reflect their own <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/conference/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&amp;action=view.php&amp;id=179&amp;type=1&amp;a=">identity</a>.</p>
<h2>Making AAC accessible to all</h2>
<p>Hawking knew his privileges in having access to the equipment and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/07434618.2014.885080">the social supports he needed</a> to participate. Unfortunately, many people in Australia who need AAC <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Speech_Pathology/Report">lack access</a> not only to the funds they need for the technology, but also to the professionals, such as speech pathologists, who know how to design and teach people how to use communication systems.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4430.0Main%20Features872015?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=4430.0&amp;issue=2015&amp;num=&amp;view=">estimates</a> that as many as 1.2 million Australians have a communication disability. With roughly a quarter of all people with <a href="http://cpaustralia.com.au/media/20379/access_economics_report.pdf">cerebral palsy</a> or autism spectrum disorders being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3869868/">unable to rely on speech to communicate</a>, it is vital that more is done to improve access to AAC worldwide.</p>
<p>Like all people who use AAC, Stephen Hawking was unique. It?s time to make communication systems like the one he used available for all who need it, so that they too can have their chance to shine.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Stephen Hawking was one of the most prominent people in history to use a high-tech communication aid known as <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/english/what-is-aac/">augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/stephen-hawking-dies-aged-76/9547454">His death</a> comes in the year of the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17549507.2018.1428687">70th Anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Over the course of his adult life, Hawking came to represent the epitome of what effective communication with AAC systems really means: gaining access to the human right of communication enshrined in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p>
<p>Today, many Australians who need AAC <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Speech_Pathology/Report">still lack access to the technology</a> and the support they need to use it. It?s time for that to change.</p>
<h2>How augmentative and alternative communication works</h2>
<p>To most people who can speak, AAC systems are a bit of a mystery ? it?s not always clear how the person using it is controlling the system. Indeed, people?s fascination with how a speech device works often overtakes their attention to what the person is actually saying.</p>
<p><figure></figure></p>

<p>AAC includes sign and gesture systems, communication boards, speech-generating devices, mobile phones with apps, and even emojis and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17549507.2017.1413137">social media</a>. Ultimately it works not only through the interaction of the user with their device, but also through their interactions with communication partners.</p>

<hr /><p>Some types of AAC don?t involve technology at all, but use the person?s body, such as sign or gesture systems. Some AAC systems are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583966">non-electronic</a>, like communication boards, books, or wallets for people to point to or look at letters, words or phrases to communicate. Other types of AAC are known as ?high-tech?, in that they involve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaLjMWbAnSw">electronic systems and computer-based technologies</a> to both store and retrieve words for communication.</p>
<p>Apart from the time taken to compose a message, it can take hours to program what could be spoken using a communication aid ? and many more to ensure that the desired words can be found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10882-015-9452-2">just in time</a> for communication.</p>
<p>Hawking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UErbwiJH1dI">used a switch to control software on a computer</a> that enabled him to talk. This kind of switch allows users to scan through options shown on the screen until they reach the letter, word or message to select for the device to ?speak?.</p>
<h2>Realising the potential of people with communication disability</h2>
<p>Hawking did not tend to use his platform in relation to <a href="https://theconversation.com/stephen-hawking-as-accidental-ambassador-for-assistive-technologies-70627">disability</a>, but when he did his words were significant. In writing the <a href="http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf">foreword to the World Report on Disability in 2011</a>, he highlighted the importance of people with disability having access to the equipment that they need, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>?we have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr /><p>A patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, Hawking inspired millions of people around the world with the condition. His lifetime achievement as a person who uses AAC was recognised by the <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Stephen-Hawking-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-announcement-FINAL.pdf">International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication</a>.</p>
<p>Although he hoped to be remembered more for his science than for his popular appearances on The Simpsons, his character delivered a vital line on communication rights and the need for AAC with a firm directive: ?Silence. I don?t need anyone to talk for me except this voice box.?</p>

<p>His call to ?look up at the stars?, should further compel AAC users and communication technologists to work together and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220802387851">reach for the stars</a> in finding solutions for people who cannot rely on speech to communicate.</p>

<h2>People who use AAC need to have a say in the design process</h2>
<p>Hawking?s fame attracted the world?s best and brightest to work with him to solve problems around the use of communication technologies. But AAC systems still don?t stop people from ?<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225183732_Slipping_Through_the_Timestream_Social_Issues_of_Time_and_Timing_in_Augmented_Interactions">slipping through the timestream</a>? of conversation. Communication using AAC systems is slow and effortful.</p>
<p>It can be hard to make a comment in a conversation ? by the time the person has got the attention of other speakers and composed their message, the conversation has moved on, and the message is delivered ?out of time?. It?s a puzzle to find systems that improve the timing and flow of talk, to match each user?s communication needs.</p>

Like the famous film critic <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_ebert_remaking_my_voice">Roger Ebert before him</a>, he had the final say on his own vocal identity.</p>
<p>Hawking?s empowered story highlights the importance of designers not allowing ableist notions of an acceptable voice to restrict an AAC user?s self-expression. His stance also reflects the importance of people who use AAC co-designing AAC systems that reflect their own <a href="https://www.isaac-online.org/conference/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&amp;action=view.php&amp;id=179&amp;type=1&amp;a=">identity</a>.</p>
<h2>Making AAC accessible to all</h2>
<p>Hawking knew his privileges in having access to the equipment and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/07434618.2014.885080">the social supports he needed</a> to participate. Unfortunately, many people in Australia who need AAC <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Speech_Pathology/Report">lack access</a> not only to the funds they need for the technology, but also to the professionals, such as speech pathologists, who know how to design and teach people how to use communication systems.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4430.0Main%20Features872015?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=4430.0&amp;issue=2015&amp;num=&amp;view=">estimates</a> that as many as 1.2 million Australians have a communication disability. With roughly a quarter of all people with <a href="http://cpaustralia.com.au/media/20379/access_economics_report.pdf">cerebral palsy</a> or autism spectrum disorders being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3869868/">unable to rely on speech to communicate</a>, it is vital that more is done to improve access to AAC worldwide.</p>
<p>Like all people who use AAC, Stephen Hawking was unique. It?s time to make communication systems like the one he used available for all who need it, so that they too can have their chance to shine.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>IN DEPTH: In this longer essay, David Irving and Alison Gould explore our cultural obsession with young blood and whether there?s any scientific evidence that transfusions of it can delay the ageing process.</em></p>
<hr /><p class="uts-lead">Ben Franklin famously wrote: ?In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes?. What he didn?t mention, despite being 83 years old, was a third, almost inevitable eventuality: ageing.</p>
<p>Depending on when in history and where on the planet you look, ageing is variously considered desirable ? bringing with it wisdom and status ? or as something to be feared, eliminated, or at least delayed as long as possible.</p>
<p>In the 16th to 18th centuries, Western societies believed old age was a time of considerable worth. But, since the 19th century, we have sought ways to eliminate or minimise the effects of ageing.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-search-to-extend-lifespan-is-gaining-ground-but-can-we-truly-reverse-the-biology-of-ageing-75127">The search to extend lifespan is gaining ground, but can we truly reverse the biology of ageing?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Even in the time of Herodotus (the 5th century), there were stories of a ?Fountain of Youth? located far away in the land of the Ethiopians, whose waters would bring youth and vigour to those who drank from it.</p>
<p>Blood is a potent symbol of life and of death. It is hardly surprising, then, that this incredible fluid is linked to the search for eternal youth in literature, legend, magic and medicine.</p>
<p>Recent scientific studies have claimed, almost vampire-like, that transfusions of blood from teenagers can help delay or reverse the ageing process. Where do these claims come from? Do they stack up? And how long will it be before we have the power to stave off what now is inevitable?</p>
<p>The first blood transfusion from one human to another is reported to date from 1492, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article-abstract/IX/4/455/932051?redirectedFrom=fulltext">for Pope Innocent VIII</a>.</p>
<p>There is some discussion as to whether this was an attempt at a blood transfusion as we understand it today, or some other form of administration of blood (such as oral), given that the theory of circulation of blood was first published in 1628, some 150 years later.</p>
<p>Sources from 1873 stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the blood of the prostrate old man should pass into the veins of a youth who had to yield up his to the Pope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But earlier reports, from 1723, were less specific:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three ten-year-old boys died because blood had been taken from their veins ? in an attempt to cure the Pope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the truth of the treatment, the pope did not recover, and neither did the boys. Here, at what is arguably the start of transfusion history, we can already see the lure of the belief in the power of young blood.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017, and the reputation of ?young blood? is moving into the world of big business.</p>
<p>A company called Alkahest, based on work by Tony Wyss-Coray, a neurobiologist studying Alzheimer?s disease at Stanford University, is spruiking the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/infusions-of-young-blood-tested-in-patients-with-dementia-1.22930">results of a trial</a> where plasma from young donors (aged 18-30) was transfused into patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Eighteen patients aged between 54 and 86 with mild to moderate Alzheimer?s disease were enrolled in the trial. They were infused with plasma (or placebo, in a control group) twice a week for four weeks.</p>
<p>Thankfully the trial was more successful than Pope Innocent VIII?s treatment. None of the patients showed any ill-effects, but neither did they show any improvement in tests of thinking ability. They did, however, demonstrate some improvement in tests that assessed their daily living skills.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/from-animal-experiments-to-saving-lives-a-history-of-blood-transfusions-80391">From animal experiments to saving lives: a history of blood transfusions</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>At almost the same time, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431294-000-human-tests-suggest-young-blood-cuts-cancer-and-alzheimers-risk/">controversial trials by a company named Ambrosia</a> (?food of the Gods? depicted as conferring immortality) are transfusing plasma from people aged 16-25 into people aged 35-92.</p>
<p>Despite the experimental nature of this treatment, participants are paying US$8,000 each to be included in the trial, for which there is no control group.</p>
<p>These factors make it virtually impossible to interpret the results, because people in the trial may ?feel better? merely through having paid money for a treatment they believe is going to work.</p>
<p>The results of the study so far were presented by Jesse Karmazin at the Recode technology conference in Los Angeles in mid-2017. Ambrosia?s scientists examined the levels of various molecules, believed to be predictive of cancer or Alzheimer?s disease, in the blood of people who had been treated.</p>
<p>They found that those who had been treated with young blood had lower levels of several proteins known to be involved in disease, namely carcinoembryonic antigens (which increase in cancer patients) and amyloid (which forms plaques in the brain in Alzheimer?s disease patients).</p>
<p>However, the long-term significance of these changes is unclear.</p>
<h2>The science of stealing youth</h2>
<p>Science has come a long way since Pope Innocent VIII, so what has led these modern scientists to try what appears to be a modern version of a very similar experiment?</p>
<p>The roots of both these companies lie in experiments in ?parabiosis? (from Greek par meaning alongside, and bios meaning life) ? a technique that dates back to the 1864 physiologist Paul Bert.</p>
<p>Bert surgically spliced animals together in his lab, so that two animals shared a single blood supply. This grizzly practice provides an opportunity to find out how soluble blood factors affect various bodily functions.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/209655/original/file-20180309-30972-1sebm30.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Mice have been regularly used for parabiosis medical procedures.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Mai Lam/The Conversation</span>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>A group at Stanford University, led by Thomas Rando, and including Irina Conboy, found in 2005 that when they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15716955">joined the bodies and circulations of old and young mice</a>, the muscle and liver cells in the old mice were able to regenerate as well as those in their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>Several experimental avenues led the researchers to conclude that the factor involved was circulating in the blood, although its identity was not known.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/dream-of-regenerating-human-body-parts-gets-a-little-closer-15177">Dream of regenerating human body parts gets a little closer</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>In 2007, Tony Wyss-Coray analysed the plasma proteins of patients with Alzheimer?s disease along with those from healthy people over a number of years. He found that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2007/071014/full/news.2007.162.html">levels of proteins in the blood change with age</a>, some increasing, others decreasing.</p>
<p>His doctoral student at the time, Saul Villeda, looked at effects of parabiosis on the brain and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886162?dopt=Abstract">found that</a> the old mice in the pairs enjoyed more brain connection, and the brains of the young mice physically deteriorated.</p>
<p>But it was hard to test how well these brains worked in practice, because measuring an old mouse?s ability to find its way through a maze is difficult when it is physically attached to a young mouse, who may be leading the way!</p>
<p>There are other problems with the interpretation of parabiosis experiments. Old animals have access to the effects of younger organs, and their brains may also benefit from the environmental enrichment of being paired with a younger animal.</p>
<p>The search was on for what factor or factors may be responsible for the dramatic effects seen in parabiosis experiments, and to find if their rejuvenating effects could be replicated without the inconvenience of sharing a circulatory system. There are a few molecular suspects so far.</p>
<p>A protein known as GDF 11 is one contender for the title of ?youth protein?. In 2013, researchers <a href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/aging-and-gdf11-what-we-know">Amy Wagers and Richard Lee</a> found that this protein from the blood of young mice can reverse the symptoms of heart failure in older mice. A year later they showed that GDF 11 appeared to act on skeletal muscle stem cells and enhance muscle repair.</p>

<hr /><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26001423">Other studies have disagreed</a>, suggesting that GDF 11 in fact increases with age and inhibits muscle repair. There are several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818972/">technical reasons</a> why these studies differ, and further studies may shed light on the role of GDF 11 and similar proteins.</p>
<p>In 2014, researchers Saul Villeda, Tony Wyss-Coray and their team <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3569">found that</a> exposing an old mouse to young blood can decrease apparent brain age. The effects were seen not only at the molecular level, but also in the structures of the brain, and in several measures of learning and memory.</p>
<p>In this case, the effects were controlled by a specific protein in the brain known as Creb (cyclic AMP response binding element), although the stimulating factor in the blood was not identified.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/210493/original/file-20180315-104650-1v2hzeo.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Mice given Tet2 are able to grow new brain cells.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Mai Lam/The Conversation</span>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The development and control of the brain involves numerous molecular signals, and a <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30156-6">recent study</a> has found yet another link between young blood and brain development. A protein in the brain, Tet2, declines with age, but mice whose brains have been given a boost of Tet2 are able to grow new brain cells and they improve at mouse-learning tasks.</p>
<p>Such a boost in Tet2 can be provided by the presence of young blood because in these experiments, old mice who are joined to young mice in a parabiosis have an increase in Tet2 in their brain. This provides yet another clue to the mechanism by which young blood acts on the brain.</p>
<h2>Youth proteins vs elder proteins</h2>
<p>While old mice show benefit from transfusions of young mouse blood, the opposite is also true: young mice show signs of ageing when exposed to their elder?s blood. It appears there are not just ?youth proteins? present in young blood, but also ?<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886162?dopt=Abstract">elder proteins</a>? in the blood of older animals.</p>
<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13363">Irina Conboy?s research team</a> used a blood exchange technique between old and young mice, without surgically joining them. The results of this method would be easier to translate into a human medical setting than parabiosis, as it resembles exchange transfusions that are already used medically.</p>

<hr /><p>When they received old blood, the muscle strength of young mice decreased, and the growth of their brain cells slowed down.</p>
<p>A protein known as B2M (beta-2-macroglobulin) may be involved in this process, although it does not appear to be elevated with age-possibly acted on by another signal from older blood.</p>
<p>Hanadie Yousef at Stanford University has <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118105-antibody-can-protect-brains-from-the-ageing-effects-of-old-blood/">identified a protein called VCAM1</a> that increases with age and causes signs of ageing when injected into young mice.

<p>So, where does this lead us today? Can teenagers full of young blood rest safely from elderly vampiric super-villains?</p>
<p>It seems that, rather than being the stuff of myth and magic, there are indeed factors in the blood that change with age: some that increase, some that decrease. Research has started to discover how some of these may work at a cellular level in muscles, organs and in particular, the brain, as we age.</p>
<p>One day these discoveries may lead to rational and targeted therapies for a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>What is certain is that human plasma contains a vast array of active molecules, many of which are already in medical use. Donated plasma has been used for decades to fight disease, control bleeding and help with certain chronic neurological disorders.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us all, plasma from people of all ages can be used in these treatments.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>IN DEPTH: In this longer essay, David Irving and Alison Gould explore our cultural obsession with young blood and whether there?s any scientific evidence that transfusions of it can delay the ageing process.</em></p>
<hr /><p class="uts-lead">Ben Franklin famously wrote: ?In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes?. What he didn?t mention, despite being 83 years old, was a third, almost inevitable eventuality: ageing.</p>
<p>Depending on when in history and where on the planet you look, ageing is variously considered desirable ? bringing with it wisdom and status ? or as something to be feared, eliminated, or at least delayed as long as possible.</p>
<p>In the 16th to 18th centuries, Western societies believed old age was a time of considerable worth. But, since the 19th century, we have sought ways to eliminate or minimise the effects of ageing.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-search-to-extend-lifespan-is-gaining-ground-but-can-we-truly-reverse-the-biology-of-ageing-75127">The search to extend lifespan is gaining ground, but can we truly reverse the biology of ageing?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Even in the time of Herodotus (the 5th century), there were stories of a ?Fountain of Youth? located far away in the land of the Ethiopians, whose waters would bring youth and vigour to those who drank from it.</p>
<p>Blood is a potent symbol of life and of death. It is hardly surprising, then, that this incredible fluid is linked to the search for eternal youth in literature, legend, magic and medicine.</p>
<p>Recent scientific studies have claimed, almost vampire-like, that transfusions of blood from teenagers can help delay or reverse the ageing process. Where do these claims come from? Do they stack up? And how long will it be before we have the power to stave off what now is inevitable?</p>
<p>The first blood transfusion from one human to another is reported to date from 1492, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article-abstract/IX/4/455/932051?redirectedFrom=fulltext">for Pope Innocent VIII</a>.</p>
<p>There is some discussion as to whether this was an attempt at a blood transfusion as we understand it today, or some other form of administration of blood (such as oral), given that the theory of circulation of blood was first published in 1628, some 150 years later.</p>
<p>Sources from 1873 stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the blood of the prostrate old man should pass into the veins of a youth who had to yield up his to the Pope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But earlier reports, from 1723, were less specific:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three ten-year-old boys died because blood had been taken from their veins ? in an attempt to cure the Pope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the truth of the treatment, the pope did not recover, and neither did the boys. Here, at what is arguably the start of transfusion history, we can already see the lure of the belief in the power of young blood.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017, and the reputation of ?young blood? is moving into the world of big business.</p>
<p>A company called Alkahest, based on work by Tony Wyss-Coray, a neurobiologist studying Alzheimer?s disease at Stanford University, is spruiking the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/infusions-of-young-blood-tested-in-patients-with-dementia-1.22930">results of a trial</a> where plasma from young donors (aged 18-30) was transfused into patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Eighteen patients aged between 54 and 86 with mild to moderate Alzheimer?s disease were enrolled in the trial. They were infused with plasma (or placebo, in a control group) twice a week for four weeks.</p>
<p>Thankfully the trial was more successful than Pope Innocent VIII?s treatment. None of the patients showed any ill-effects, but neither did they show any improvement in tests of thinking ability. They did, however, demonstrate some improvement in tests that assessed their daily living skills.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/from-animal-experiments-to-saving-lives-a-history-of-blood-transfusions-80391">From animal experiments to saving lives: a history of blood transfusions</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>At almost the same time, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431294-000-human-tests-suggest-young-blood-cuts-cancer-and-alzheimers-risk/">controversial trials by a company named Ambrosia</a> (?food of the Gods? depicted as conferring immortality) are transfusing plasma from people aged 16-25 into people aged 35-92.</p>
<p>Despite the experimental nature of this treatment, participants are paying US$8,000 each to be included in the trial, for which there is no control group.</p>
<p>These factors make it virtually impossible to interpret the results, because people in the trial may ?feel better? merely through having paid money for a treatment they believe is going to work.</p>
<p>The results of the study so far were presented by Jesse Karmazin at the Recode technology conference in Los Angeles in mid-2017. Ambrosia?s scientists examined the levels of various molecules, believed to be predictive of cancer or Alzheimer?s disease, in the blood of people who had been treated.</p>
<p>They found that those who had been treated with young blood had lower levels of several proteins known to be involved in disease, namely carcinoembryonic antigens (which increase in cancer patients) and amyloid (which forms plaques in the brain in Alzheimer?s disease patients).</p>
<p>However, the long-term significance of these changes is unclear.</p>
<h2>The science of stealing youth</h2>
<p>Science has come a long way since Pope Innocent VIII, so what has led these modern scientists to try what appears to be a modern version of a very similar experiment?</p>
<p>The roots of both these companies lie in experiments in ?parabiosis? (from Greek par meaning alongside, and bios meaning life) ? a technique that dates back to the 1864 physiologist Paul Bert.</p>
<p>Bert surgically spliced animals together in his lab, so that two animals shared a single blood supply. This grizzly practice provides an opportunity to find out how soluble blood factors affect various bodily functions.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/209655/original/file-20180309-30972-1sebm30.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Mice have been regularly used for parabiosis medical procedures.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Mai Lam/The Conversation</span>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>A group at Stanford University, led by Thomas Rando, and including Irina Conboy, found in 2005 that when they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15716955">joined the bodies and circulations of old and young mice</a>, the muscle and liver cells in the old mice were able to regenerate as well as those in their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>Several experimental avenues led the researchers to conclude that the factor involved was circulating in the blood, although its identity was not known.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/dream-of-regenerating-human-body-parts-gets-a-little-closer-15177">Dream of regenerating human body parts gets a little closer</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>In 2007, Tony Wyss-Coray analysed the plasma proteins of patients with Alzheimer?s disease along with those from healthy people over a number of years. He found that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2007/071014/full/news.2007.162.html">levels of proteins in the blood change with age</a>, some increasing, others decreasing.</p>
<p>His doctoral student at the time, Saul Villeda, looked at effects of parabiosis on the brain and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886162?dopt=Abstract">found that</a> the old mice in the pairs enjoyed more brain connection, and the brains of the young mice physically deteriorated.</p>
<p>But it was hard to test how well these brains worked in practice, because measuring an old mouse?s ability to find its way through a maze is difficult when it is physically attached to a young mouse, who may be leading the way!</p>
<p>There are other problems with the interpretation of parabiosis experiments. Old animals have access to the effects of younger organs, and their brains may also benefit from the environmental enrichment of being paired with a younger animal.</p>
<p>The search was on for what factor or factors may be responsible for the dramatic effects seen in parabiosis experiments, and to find if their rejuvenating effects could be replicated without the inconvenience of sharing a circulatory system. There are a few molecular suspects so far.</p>
<p>A protein known as GDF 11 is one contender for the title of ?youth protein?. In 2013, researchers <a href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/aging-and-gdf11-what-we-know">Amy Wagers and Richard Lee</a> found that this protein from the blood of young mice can reverse the symptoms of heart failure in older mice. A year later they showed that GDF 11 appeared to act on skeletal muscle stem cells and enhance muscle repair.</p>

<hr /><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26001423">Other studies have disagreed</a>, suggesting that GDF 11 in fact increases with age and inhibits muscle repair. There are several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818972/">technical reasons</a> why these studies differ, and further studies may shed light on the role of GDF 11 and similar proteins.</p>
<p>In 2014, researchers Saul Villeda, Tony Wyss-Coray and their team <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3569">found that</a> exposing an old mouse to young blood can decrease apparent brain age. The effects were seen not only at the molecular level, but also in the structures of the brain, and in several measures of learning and memory.</p>
<p>In this case, the effects were controlled by a specific protein in the brain known as Creb (cyclic AMP response binding element), although the stimulating factor in the blood was not identified.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/210493/original/file-20180315-104650-1v2hzeo.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Mice given Tet2 are able to grow new brain cells.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Mai Lam/The Conversation</span>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The development and control of the brain involves numerous molecular signals, and a <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30156-6">recent study</a> has found yet another link between young blood and brain development. A protein in the brain, Tet2, declines with age, but mice whose brains have been given a boost of Tet2 are able to grow new brain cells and they improve at mouse-learning tasks.</p>
<p>Such a boost in Tet2 can be provided by the presence of young blood because in these experiments, old mice who are joined to young mice in a parabiosis have an increase in Tet2 in their brain. This provides yet another clue to the mechanism by which young blood acts on the brain.</p>
<h2>Youth proteins vs elder proteins</h2>
<p>While old mice show benefit from transfusions of young mouse blood, the opposite is also true: young mice show signs of ageing when exposed to their elder?s blood. It appears there are not just ?youth proteins? present in young blood, but also ?<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886162?dopt=Abstract">elder proteins</a>? in the blood of older animals.</p>
<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13363">Irina Conboy?s research team</a> used a blood exchange technique between old and young mice, without surgically joining them. The results of this method would be easier to translate into a human medical setting than parabiosis, as it resembles exchange transfusions that are already used medically.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">A team of young science students has won an industry education grant to develop a novel campaign against potentially deadly meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>The UTS Faculty of Science undergraduates have designed an emotional awareness promotion aimed at their peers, an age group at risk from a disease that has seen a significant spike in infections over the past three years.</p>
<p>Artworks created by meningococcal survivors to elicit a deep emotional response from young people will be showcased at an interactive arts festival called VAX &amp; ATE.  Survivors of meningococcal disease will be present to talk and connect with students.</p>
<p>Team member, and final year Medical Science student, Keisha Prasad says that before her involvement in the campaign she and her fellow team members had no personal connection to the disease nor really understood the potential impacts.</p>
<p>?As we got more involved we connected with a former UTS student who'd contracted an invasive form of the disease and lost all his limbs. We didn?t think these things happened.</p>
<p>?Now we have a personal connection [to meningococcal disease] and we hope our campaign will make it personal for other UTS students as well,? she says.</p>
<p>The grant is the result of an innovative partnership between UTS Science and Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccinations arm of global healthcare giant Sanofi.</p>
<p>Students studying human pathophysiology in the UTS school of life sciences attended a series of workshops led by Sanofi Pasteur experts, forming teams to devise ways to educate their peers about meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>?All too often in Australia we take [the battle against] infectious diseases for granted,? says Dr Hui Chen, the medical doctor and UTS academic who developed the human pathophysiology course.</p>
<p>?This is hardly surprising as our health care system is among the best in the world, and rates of infectious diseases are low.</p>
<p>?However, this sometimes leads to complacency, especially among young adults who perceive risk differently to older people.?</p>
<p>Dr Chen worked with infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Brian Oliver to help the students create their innovative campaigns. The top five teams pitched their ideas to Sanofi Pasteur senior executives, with the winning team receiving a $5,000 educational grant to implement their idea.</p>
<p>?The students have a wide knowledge of the clinical aspects of different human diseases,? says Dr Chen. ?This collaboration allowed them to solve a real-life problem in the classroom.?</p>
<p> Mr Russell Jacobsen, General Manager ANZ Sanofi Pasteur said that this pilot project brought together academia and industry to work together.</p>
<p> ?This collaboration has allowed industry and the university to work together in an innovative and creative way to respond to a current public health issue in Australia,? he said.</p>
<p>WHAT IS MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE?</p>
<p>? Meningococcal disease is rare among high school and university students but its onset is rapid and it can be fatal</p>
<p>? Typical symptoms include a rash, vomiting, fever, headache and/or stiff neck, drowsiness, sensitivity to bright light, joint pain</p>
<p>? Vaccines are available in Australia for each of the most common strains of the disease ? A, B, C, W and Y</p>
<p>? A new vaccine that targets strains A, C, W and Y is part of the national immunisation program for very young children, in response to a surge in notifications</p>
<p>? NSW Health is funding the MenACWY vaccine for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years while the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers listing it for all Australian adolescents</p>
<p>? Hygiene precautions such as hand-washing and cough etiquette will minimise the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The winning team of Yeshi Tsomo, Mohammad Al-Qazwini, Keisha Prasad, Harris Jabbour and Wayne But will unveil their campaign at the Vax &amp; Ate interactive arts festival on UTS Alumni Green, Tuesday 27 March, 11am-4pm.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">A team of young science students has won an industry education grant to develop a novel campaign against potentially deadly meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>The UTS Faculty of Science undergraduates have designed an emotional awareness promotion aimed at their peers, an age group at risk from a disease that has seen a significant spike in infections over the past three years.</p>
<p>Artworks created by meningococcal survivors to elicit a deep emotional response from young people will be showcased at an interactive arts festival called VAX &amp; ATE.  Survivors of meningococcal disease will be present to talk and connect with students.</p>
<p>Team member, and final year Medical Science student, Keisha Prasad says that before her involvement in the campaign she and her fellow team members had no personal connection to the disease nor really understood the potential impacts.</p>
<p>?As we got more involved we connected with a former UTS student who'd contracted an invasive form of the disease and lost all his limbs. We didn?t think these things happened.</p>
<p>?Now we have a personal connection [to meningococcal disease] and we hope our campaign will make it personal for other UTS students as well,? she says.</p>
<p>The grant is the result of an innovative partnership between UTS Science and Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccinations arm of global healthcare giant Sanofi.</p>
<p>Students studying human pathophysiology in the UTS school of life sciences attended a series of workshops led by Sanofi Pasteur experts, forming teams to devise ways to educate their peers about meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>?All too often in Australia we take [the battle against] infectious diseases for granted,? says Dr Hui Chen, the medical doctor and UTS academic who developed the human pathophysiology course.</p>
<p>?This is hardly surprising as our health care system is among the best in the world, and rates of infectious diseases are low.</p>
<p>?However, this sometimes leads to complacency, especially among young adults who perceive risk differently to older people.?</p>
<p>Dr Chen worked with infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Brian Oliver to help the students create their innovative campaigns. The top five teams pitched their ideas to Sanofi Pasteur senior executives, with the winning team receiving a $5,000 educational grant to implement their idea.</p>
<p>?The students have a wide knowledge of the clinical aspects of different human diseases,? says Dr Chen. ?This collaboration allowed them to solve a real-life problem in the classroom.?</p>
<p> Mr Russell Jacobsen, General Manager ANZ Sanofi Pasteur said that this pilot project brought together academia and industry to work together.</p>
<p> ?This collaboration has allowed industry and the university to work together in an innovative and creative way to respond to a current public health issue in Australia,? he said.</p>
<p>WHAT IS MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE?</p>
<p>? Meningococcal disease is rare among high school and university students but its onset is rapid and it can be fatal</p>
<p>? Typical symptoms include a rash, vomiting, fever, headache and/or stiff neck, drowsiness, sensitivity to bright light, joint pain</p>
<p>? Vaccines are available in Australia for each of the most common strains of the disease ? A, B, C, W and Y</p>
<p>? A new vaccine that targets strains A, C, W and Y is part of the national immunisation program for very young children, in response to a surge in notifications</p>
<p>? NSW Health is funding the MenACWY vaccine for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years while the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers listing it for all Australian adolescents</p>
<p>? Hygiene precautions such as hand-washing and cough etiquette will minimise the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The winning team of Yeshi Tsomo, Mohammad Al-Qazwini, Keisha Prasad, Harris Jabbour and Wayne But will unveil their campaign at the Vax &amp; Ate interactive arts festival on UTS Alumni Green, Tuesday 27 March, 11am-4pm.</p>

It is the leading cause of adult disability in Australia and the second leading cause of death globally.</p>
<p>An international research consortium studying more than half a million individuals from around the world has identified 22 new genetic risk factors for stroke, casting fresh light on why strokes happen and how they might be better prevented or treated.</p>
<p>The research findings show shared genetic influences with multiple related vascular conditions, especially blood pressure, but also coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and others.</p>
<p>The MEGASTROKE project is the largest genetic study on stroke and contains analysis of DNA samples from 520,000 European, North and South American, Asian, African and Australian participants, of whom 67,000 had suffered a stroke. The results are published online in the journal <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0058-3"><em>Nature Genetics</em></a>.</p>
<p>?Although stroke can occur at any age, we know it is more likely as one gets older. We also know that stroke is not one disease but a complex combination of many related diseases, and no single genetic variant is responsible for stroke risk,? says study co-author Professor Jane Maguire, from the UTS Faculty of Health.</p>
<p>?Reducing the burden of this disease is increasingly urgent as our population ages but because the causes remain poorly understood, the development of new treatments and preventive strategies is challenging.?</p>
<p>The research team says its large-scale collaboration spanning all continents and cultures has been a game changer in studying the genetics of a complex common disease such as stroke.</p>
<p>Stroke happens when there are changes in blood vessels including large and small arteries, the heart and veins. The most common type of stroke is caused by a blood clot (ischaemic stroke) while the most catastrophic is caused by a bleed (haemorrhagic stroke).</p>
<p>The scope and depth of the MEGASTROKE data has given researchers first insights into the specific genes, molecular pathways and cell and tissue types through which the newly identified genetic risk factors cause stroke. The study shows some genetic risk factors contribute to specific mechanisms and others to stroke susceptibility at large. Researchers have also found previously unknown genetic links between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.</p>
<p>Of the 32 genetic variants ? or 149 genes ? reported in the study, 11 risk factors are in biological areas not previously thought to contribute to stroke. Sixteen genes are known drug targets in the management of other diseases or conditions.</p>
<p>?This surprise finding is the most clinically translatable aspect of our study and opens the door to investigating completely new targets for stroke prevention and management and increases our understanding of the biology of a stroke,? says Professor Maguire, whose work on stroke genetics began with her PhD.</p>
<p>?We now have the very real possibility that existing drugs can be repurposed more quickly for use in stroke prevention and management.</p>
<p>?More than half a million subjects have gone into this study and it has involved collaboration from many dedicated and passionate researchers around the world. It?s taken 10 years but things are really starting to pick up speed now.?</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">As gestations go, it?s right up there with elephants. After 18 months of painstaking work, the UTS Centre for Forensic Science (CFS) has farewelled one of the most unusual instruments to come out of its lab ? a stabbing machine called Conan.</p>
<p>For police investigating knife crime, understanding how blades penetrate and damage fabric is crucial. Thanks to a partnership between UTS and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the development of this revolutionary new forensic tool that just became a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>In 2014, AFP forensic chemist and UTS alumna Kate Sloan contacted Centre for Forensic Science director Claude Roux because they wanted to develop a machine to help understand how factors such as the force and angle of the blade influence the patterns knives make in fabrics.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tz2LS_ikx78" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Investigators can already tell a lot about a crime by looking at textile damage, but the manual testing currently used to re-create stabbing events can be both difficult and time-consuming. The aim of the AFP and the UTS researchers was to build an instrument to help establish a textile damage database so investigators can objectively examine textile damage patterns in stab events.</p>
<p>In 2014, Natasha Benson (now a PhD candidate in the Centre for Forensic Science) leapt at the chance to take on the project for her honours year. Since then, she has worked with Sloan, Roux and Centre for Forensic Science researcher Lucas Blanes to develop, test and validate the machine.</p>
<p>?I?d always wanted to work with the AFP and for me it was by far the most interesting project on the list of possible honours topics,? Benson says.</p>
<p>?Because I'm not a trained engineer, I see myself as a bit of a ?barbaric engineer?. Hence the name Conan, after ?Conan the Barbarian? of course.?</p>
<p>Conan, a mechanical and electronic marvel now ?living? in a new AFP purpose-built forensic facility in Canberra, is a world first. The computer-controlled technology is able to produce standardised, reproducible stab actions, improving the accuracy and precision of simulated textile cuts.</p>
<p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div id="file-30786" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">
  <img alt="Lucas Blanes and Natasha Benson. Photo: Shane Lo" height="630" width="980" class="media-element file-default" src="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/lucasblanes.natashabenson.shanelo.jpg" /></div>
</div>
<p>It also features an interchangeable knife holder that is compatible with different types of knives and blades, and a motorised arm that can deliver 60 unique and angled stabbing positions. Conan, living up to its name, can be programmed to generate enough force to penetrate human flesh and several layers of clothing.</p>
<p>With Blanes as a co-supervisor, Benson was in safe hands. The Brazilian-born Blanes couples his training in biology, biochemistry and analytical chemistry with an affinity for mechanics, electronics and problem solving. Within the centre he?s well known for his MacGyver-like skills and mantra that ?with duct tape you can do magic?.</p>
<p>?The challenge,? says Blanes, ?was to build something new. We?d never seen it before; we didn?t have a model. Until now, the closest thing was either a guillotine-like instrument or a knife with sensors. But we needed something easy to use that was also safe, economical and robust.</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?The technology will fill in gaps in textile damage analysis by providing reference standards that can be used in forensic casework?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Budgetary constraints and a tight 12-month honours timeline meant the scientists needed to be especially creative. Conventional moving platforms, known as axis stages, that tilt and spin through multiple planes, were well outside the project?s budget.</p>
<p>?I decided to search the internet and, amazingly, the type of platforms I needed were available for a fraction of the cost,? Benson says.</p>
<p>For Blanes, who has previously built working instruments using LEGO blocks, the challenges were to incorporate a range of factors that influence stab events, to overcome safety issues, and to maintain the integrity of the knives that would need to be used as evidence in real cases.</p>
<p>Many trips to the local hardware store for hinges and hardware ensued, as did forays into electronic and software development. Finally, the prototype Conan morphed into a fully fledged investigative tool ready to be put to practical use fighting crime.</p>
<p>So what are Benson and Blanes doing now that Conan has left UTS, and Blanes has returned to Brazil? The pair are continuing to work together as student and co-supervisor. Benson?s current research is on ?lab-on-a-chip? explosives detection technology.</p>
<p>?It?s about the detection of explosives by miniaturising laboratory processes into small paper-based platforms, smaller than the size of your hand, for rapid, automated and in-field detection,? Benson says. </p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">As gestations go, it?s right up there with elephants. After 18 months of painstaking work, the UTS Centre for Forensic Science (CFS) has farewelled one of the most unusual instruments to come out of its lab ? a stabbing machine called Conan.</p>
<p>For police investigating knife crime, understanding how blades penetrate and damage fabric is crucial. Thanks to a partnership between UTS and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the development of this revolutionary new forensic tool that just became a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>In 2014, AFP forensic chemist and UTS alumna Kate Sloan contacted Centre for Forensic Science director Claude Roux because they wanted to develop a machine to help understand how factors such as the force and angle of the blade influence the patterns knives make in fabrics.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tz2LS_ikx78" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Investigators can already tell a lot about a crime by looking at textile damage, but the manual testing currently used to re-create stabbing events can be both difficult and time-consuming. The aim of the AFP and the UTS researchers was to build an instrument to help establish a textile damage database so investigators can objectively examine textile damage patterns in stab events.</p>
<p>In 2014, Natasha Benson (now a PhD candidate in the Centre for Forensic Science) leapt at the chance to take on the project for her honours year. Since then, she has worked with Sloan, Roux and Centre for Forensic Science researcher Lucas Blanes to develop, test and validate the machine.</p>
<p>?I?d always wanted to work with the AFP and for me it was by far the most interesting project on the list of possible honours topics,? Benson says.</p>
<p>?Because I'm not a trained engineer, I see myself as a bit of a ?barbaric engineer?. Hence the name Conan, after ?Conan the Barbarian? of course.?</p>
<p>Conan, a mechanical and electronic marvel now ?living? in a new AFP purpose-built forensic facility in Canberra, is a world first. The computer-controlled technology is able to produce standardised, reproducible stab actions, improving the accuracy and precision of simulated textile cuts.</p>
<p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div id="file-30786" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">

</div>
<p>It also features an interchangeable knife holder that is compatible with different types of knives and blades, and a motorised arm that can deliver 60 unique and angled stabbing positions. Conan, living up to its name, can be programmed to generate enough force to penetrate human flesh and several layers of clothing.</p>
<p>With Blanes as a co-supervisor, Benson was in safe hands. The Brazilian-born Blanes couples his training in biology, biochemistry and analytical chemistry with an affinity for mechanics, electronics and problem solving. Within the centre he?s well known for his MacGyver-like skills and mantra that ?with duct tape you can do magic?.</p>
<p>?The challenge,? says Blanes, ?was to build something new. We?d never seen it before; we didn?t have a model. Until now, the closest thing was either a guillotine-like instrument or a knife with sensors. But we needed something easy to use that was also safe, economical and robust.</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?The technology will fill in gaps in textile damage analysis by providing reference standards that can be used in forensic casework?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Budgetary constraints and a tight 12-month honours timeline meant the scientists needed to be especially creative. Conventional moving platforms, known as axis stages, that tilt and spin through multiple planes, were well outside the project?s budget.</p>
<p>?I decided to search the internet and, amazingly, the type of platforms I needed were available for a fraction of the cost,? Benson says.</p>
<p>For Blanes, who has previously built working instruments using LEGO blocks, the challenges were to incorporate a range of factors that influence stab events, to overcome safety issues, and to maintain the integrity of the knives that would need to be used as evidence in real cases.</p>
<p>Many trips to the local hardware store for hinges and hardware ensued, as did forays into electronic and software development. Finally, the prototype Conan morphed into a fully fledged investigative tool ready to be put to practical use fighting crime.</p>
<p>So what are Benson and Blanes doing now that Conan has left UTS, and Blanes has returned to Brazil? The pair are continuing to work together as student and co-supervisor. Benson?s current research is on ?lab-on-a-chip? explosives detection technology.</p>
<p>?It?s about the detection of explosives by miniaturising laboratory processes into small paper-based platforms, smaller than the size of your hand, for rapid, automated and in-field detection,? Benson says. </p>

<p class="uts-lead">Parents of babies born with heart disease are likely to benefit from routine cardiac genetic counselling to reduce risk, prevent future disease and improve treatment outcomes, according to world-first research led by UNSW Sydney, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and the Sydney Children?s Hospitals Network.</p>
<p>In a study of one hundred parents of children with congenital heart disease who had surgery between 2000 and 2009, almost all parents showed clear preference for a single genetics appointment with both a specialised clinical geneticist and genetic counsellor, offered as soon as possible after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Lead author UNSW Associate Professor Nadine Kasparian, and co-authors Dr Richard De Abreu Lourenco and Professor Rosalie Viney from the UTS Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, said the study, published in Genetics in Medicine, showed that meeting a specialised clinical geneticist and cardiac genetic counsellor, supported by online health resources, was a high priority for parents of children with heart disease.</p>
<p>?This study highlights an important gap between what parents feel they need and what is currently available,? says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>?Specialised paediatric cardiac genetics services can provide information about genetic and other risk factors associated with a child?s heart condition, as well as offer emotional support to alleviate the feelings of guilt, fear and sadness parents so often feel.?</p>
<p>Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with congenital heart disease, which includes malformations of the heart, heart valves or major blood vessels. Worldwide there are about 1.35 million babies diagnosed with congenital heart disease each year. It is a leading cause of infant death and one of the most common reasons babies are admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>After diagnosis of congenital heart disease, paediatric cardiologists usually discuss the possible genetic implications with parents, however referrals to a cardiac genetics service are less common. Funding of additional resources would allow more referrals to properly structured congenital heart genetics clinics.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Kasparian says the great majority of parents of babies with congenital heart disease would like to be offered this service, with 93% of parents in the study indicating they would attend an appointment with a specialised clinical geneticist and counsellor, if offered within two weeks of referral.</p>
<p>?In order to plan services, we need to understand the needs of the people the service is supposed to help?, says co-author and clinical geneticist UNSW Conjoint Professor Edwin Kirk. ?In this study, we heard from parents about their ideal service. We may not always be able to reach the ideal, but this gives us a clear goal to aim for.?</p>
<p>The study showed the presence of a genetic counsellor in addition to a geneticist made it even more likely for parents to attend the appointment.</p>
<p>?The genetics landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are learning more about the genetics of childhood heart disease every day,? says UNSW Associate Professor Kasparian. ?This study shows the need for greater resources and new models of care. There are important discoveries being made at molecular level and our services need to be ready for when these discoveries are translated into clinical care.?</p>
<p>More resources, funding and workforce training are needed before the model of care preferred by parents could be implemented, says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>?The growing demands for paediatric cardiac genetics services means genetic counsellors, working with cardiac teams, could play a greater role in the care of children with heart disease and their families,? says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>The study comes as Health Minister Greg Hunt announced on February 14 the first National Action Plan to discover treatments for thousands of Australians affected by childhood heart disease. It will be important that we extend that action to the delivery of services that better meet the needs of parents of children with heart disease.</p>
