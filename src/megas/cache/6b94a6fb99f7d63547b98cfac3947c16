Thanks to our pal Kevin Provost for doing this thankless service. I'll be on live every Thursday night from 6-8 PM NYC (Eastern Standard Time) or look in the archive at www.littlewaterradio.org or on mixcloud (search for The Hound Show).

After a short 20 year breather, I'm back on the radio, well, sort of radio, I broadcast live every Thursday from 6-8 PM Eastern Standard Time (NYC time) and the shows eventually wind up in the archive, listen at www.littlewaterradio.org (look in the archive), or at Mixcloud (their search engine is pretty funky, search for The Hound Show).

<br />
The Nite Riders aka The Nightriders, the Night Riders, sometimes with Doc Starkes (aka Starks) or Melvin Smith's name out front, formed in 1954, put together by bassist James "Doc" Starkes, and was made up of seasoned R&amp;B pros, all of whom had plenty of previous experience. Vocalist Melvin Smith had recorded for RCA with honker Clyde "Blow Top" Smith's Houserockers, and for RCA's Groove subsidiary as a solo act. Guitarist Harry Crafton has recorded many rockin' sides for Gotham and Oscar. &nbsp;The rhythm section featured piano man Harry Van Walls (who can be heard on Stick McGhee's Atlantic recording of Drinkin' Wine Spo-De-O-Dee), and seasoned session man Jimmy Johnson on drums. Joe Sewell played tenor sax. In the next ten years they recorded at least 29 singles (maybe more) for small labels, they varied in quality from great to mediocre, but most are quite good.<br />
&nbsp; They were not kids, these were seasoned professional musicians, all had extensive recording experience in the R&amp;B field and felt the oncoming onslaught of rock'n'roll. Starkes knew a tight, pro rock'n'roll band could find steady work, and maybe even a hit record. The first they found in abundance, the latter alluded them for the ten years that they existed. Formed in Philadelphia, they eventually were based in Hartford, Connecticut, with extended stays in Montreal, Quebec (where it seems Harry Van Walls settled in to form his own band) and the Jersey Shore, although they were booked almost constantly up and down the eastern seaboard. They went through the usual dozens of personal changes, Starkes and Mel Smith being the constant members. They received almost no press coverage then or now and facts are hard to come by. No one thought it important to interview Doc Starkes, or Mel Smith. Crafton and Van Walls careers were covered, the former on the liner notes to the Krazy Kat re-issue LP of his Gotham sides, the latter in the old <i>Wine Women and Whiskey</i> R&amp;B zine. &nbsp;What we have to tell the story are the discs they left behind.<br />
&nbsp;Their recording debut was backing up female R&amp;B singer Fay Simmons which appeared on Grand in 1954-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/26%20Whim%20Wham%20Wop.mp3">Whim Wham Whop</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/27%20Making%20a%20Fast%20Get-a%20Way.mp3">Making A Fast Getaway</a>.

Once again, it disappeared without a trace. The next three singles were on Juggay Murray's New York based Sue label (which released several excellent Ike Turner instrumentals as well as Ike &amp; Tina's early hits): The first, and best was a frantic Bo Diddley styled rocker <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/20%20Pretty%20Plaid%20Skirt.mp3">Pretty Plaid Skirt (and Long Black Socks)</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/21%20I'll%20Never%20Change.mp3">I'll Never Change</a>. The a-side might have been a hit had it been issued in Japan. It came out in the spring of 1959, followed by <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/17%20Looking%20For%20My%20Baby.mp3">Lookin' For My Baby</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/18%20St.%20Loo.mp3">St. Loo</a>, and<br />

They kept recording, in the early 60's just before splitting up they cut sides for Cherry and Courtesy, neither of which I've ever seen or heard.<br />
&nbsp; In this day and age of over documentation, &nbsp;when every knucklehead with who needs to express their precious feelings in public can be found on Youtube and their mom's phone, it makes it even harder to grasp that their is no film footage, photos, or live recordings of a great band like the Nite Riders (or Guitar Slim, Esquerita, ad infinitum). Perhaps in some one's basement lurks such an entire box of such ephemera, &nbsp;perhaps some day we'll all see it. For now, I'm just glad we have the discs.<br />

The next three singles were on Juggay Murray's New York based Sue label (which released several excellent Ike Turner instrumentals as well as Ike &amp; Tina's early hits): The first, and best was a frantic Bo Diddley styled rocker <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/20%20Pretty%20Plaid%20Skirt.mp3">Pretty Plaid Skirt (and Long Black Socks)</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/21%20I'll%20Never%20Change.mp3">I'll Never Change</a>. The a-side might have been a hit had it been issued in Japan. It came out in the spring of 1959, followed by <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/17%20Looking%20For%20My%20Baby.mp3">Lookin' For My Baby</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/18%20St.%20Loo.mp3">St. Loo</a>, and<br />
a remake of<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/19%20Night%20Riding-2.mp3"> Night Ridin'</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/16%20Talk%20To%20Me%20baby.mp3">Talk To Me Baby</a> later the same year. They kept recording, in the early 60's just before splitting up they cut sides for Cherry and Courtesy, neither of which I've ever seen or heard.<br />
&nbsp; In this day and age of over documentation, &nbsp;when every knucklehead with who needs to express their precious feelings in public can be found on Youtube and their mom's phone, it makes it even harder to grasp that their is no film footage, photos, or live recordings of a great band like the Nite Riders (or Guitar Slim, Esquerita, ad infinitum). Perhaps in some one's basement lurks such an entire box of such ephemera, &nbsp;perhaps some day we'll all see it. For now, I'm just glad we have the discs.<br />

<b><br />
</b><br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<b>&nbsp;</b>Utah Smith was born in 1906 in Cedar Grove, Louisiana, &nbsp;in the countryside outside of Shreveport. He was schooled to the third grade, then took a job as a water boy in the cotton fields before graduating to picking cotton. He later worked in a chicken plant plucking and cleaning chickens, a job he was fired from. &nbsp;In 1923, he took up the calling and became an evangelist in the Church of God In Christ, usually just called the Holiness or Sanctified Church. He was &nbsp;married in 1929, set up a home in Shreveport, but was on the road by 1925 where he'd spend most of the next forty years.<br />
&nbsp; Smith had taken up harmonica as a teen, soon switching to a steel guitar, and finally an electric guitar. He also had noticed that he, as many were later to testify, had healing powers, and an ability to tell jokes. Early on he was billed as &nbsp;"God's Funny Boy" and was heard preaching the Devil's funeral and attempting to move trees which of course didn't budge as well as "laying on the hands" healing the sick and maimed. &nbsp;By 1938 he was using his electric guitar in his revival meetings, &nbsp;his daughter for one claiming he was the "first black man to own one", and if he was not the first, he was certainly among them. Folks would travel for miles just to see the thing.<br />
&nbsp; On the gospel highway, Reverend or sometimes Elder Utah Smith proved to be a popular attraction and he criss crossed America for four decades, his photographs appeared in not only the major black publications but also <i>Newsweek</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, in folk music publications and he was recorded and broadcast for the <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/03%20Two%20Wings%20And%20Everyman's%20Got%20To%20Lay%20Down%20And%20Die.mp3">BBC</a> in 1947 as part of a audio documentary called "The Story Of New Orleans Music".<br />
He would make three commercial recordings, which would be issued on at least six different labels, three of which were versions of his theme song-- I Want Two Wings. First came a 78 RPM for Regis, recorded and first issued in 1944, then re-issued on Manor (1949), Arco (1950) and on 45 rpm on Kay-Ron (1958)<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20I%20Want%20Two%20Wings.mp3">: I Want Two Wings </a>b/w &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Rev.%20Utah%20Smith%20-%20God's%20Mighty%20Hand.mp3">God's Mighty Hand</a>. The second disc came in 1947 and was self issued on his own Two Winged Temple label out of New Orleans--<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/05%20Rev.%20Utah%20Smith%20-%20I%20Got%20Two%20Wings.mp3"> (I Got) Two Wings</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/06%20Glory%20to%20Jesus,%20I'm%20Free.mp3">Glory To Jesus I'm Free</a>, this is the rarest of his commercial discs, it was pressed as a 78 and later on 45.<br />
In 1953 he cut a session for Checker in Chicago, two songs were released-- the third rendition of<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Two%20Wings.mp3"> Two Wings</a> and on the flip side <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/04%20Take%20A%20Trip.mp3">Take A Trip</a>, which is a re-working of the old gospel standard Gospel Ship.<br />
All these discs feature his crude, open tuned guitar prominently, and he is backed by a small female choir on all of them. There also exists at least two other versions of Two Wings he recorded that exist on single copy acetates.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Rev. Utah Smith ran his own Church in New Orleans, the aforementioned Two Winged Temple (the first location was torn down to build the Calliope projects, the second was on Octavia off Magazine), but was best known for holding revival meetings, many of which were covered in the pages of the<i> Louisiana Weekly</i> newspaper. &nbsp;He was fairly famous in and around New Orleans, but traveled from coast to coast, catching the attention of composer and <i>New York Tribune</i> music critic Virgil Thomson while appearing in Newark, N.J. in '41. &nbsp;Thomson approved of what he saw calling him "an interesting musical manifestation". Indeed. The same year he appeared at one of NYC's Museum Of Modern Art's "Coffee Concerts". &nbsp;In the 1950's he toured with gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson, the Bells Of Joy and Brother Joe May, the Thunderbolt Of The Mid-West (for a time May's pianist was Esquerita, could Esquerita and Utah Smith have met?), knocked 'em dead in Atlanta, Memphis and Dallas, and generally made a big impression on everyone who saw him, &nbsp;sometimes wearing gigantic white paper wings and always blasting away on a Gibson electric guitar. <br />
&nbsp; The gospel highway is rough on the body though, and Smith suffered from diabetes (he was said to eat twenty biscuits in one sitting) and glaucoma, and in 1961 he retired to the Octavia Street Temple's basement where he died on January 24, 1965, blind and no longer able to play his guitar, it was said &nbsp;he'd taken to drink and fell down the stairs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;The life and times Of Rev. Utah Smith were fascinating, and for a more detailed look I refer you to Lynn Abbott's biography-- <i>I Got Two Wings (Incidents and Anecdotes Of The To Winged Preacher and Electric Guitar Evangelist Elder Utah Smith)</i> (<a href="http://www.aumfidelity.com/casequarter.html">Case Quarter</a>, 2008) which also comes with a CD of his complete recordings.

Today's found photo from the Fang bears the date, printed on the right side of the border, of December '69, as if we couldn't have figured that out our self. Yes, this was taken at Altamont, the all time rock festival bummer and setting for still the greatest of all rock snuff flicks <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065780/">Gimme Shelter</a>.

Today's found photo from the Fang bears the date, printed on the right side of the border, of December '69, as if we couldn't have figured that out our self.

<b><br />
</b><br />
Andy Shernoff has had a longer recording career than Howlin' Wolf or Muddy Waters. That in itself is not so remarkable, there are plenty of pediatric rockstars out there who have been around longer. What is remarkable is that he's still great. When was the last time Ray Davies or Pete Townshend wrote a good song? (If you ask me, and you shouldn't cuz I ain't gonna argue about it, I'd say 1970 and '67 receptively).<br />
Andy's last great song was released a couple of weeks ago (Are You Ready To Rapture, see video above, I assume you can order the 45 rpm from his <a href="http://www.andyshernoff.com/">website</a>).<br />
&nbsp;Shernoff, who's career began with might be the greatest (and definitely the funniest) ever fanzine-- <i>Teenage Wasteland Gazette </i>(a never published final issue of which has resided in Handsome Dick Manitoba's closet for forty something years), is best known as full time songwriter, bassist and sometimes lead singer for NYC rock'n'roll institution&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedictators.com/">the Dictators</a>, whose 1974 debut <i>The Dictators Go Girl Crazy (</i>Epic)<i>&nbsp;</i>remains one of the greatest and most perfect punk rock records ever released. He shepherded the Dictators through three more fine LP's-- <i>Manifest Destiny</i> (Asylum,1977), <i>Blood Brothers </i>(Asylum,1978) and <i>D.F.F. D.</i> (Dictators Multi-Media, 2002), and don't forget <a href="http://www.nortonrecords.com/">Norton Records</a>' 2009 release<i> Everyday's Saturday </i>that features their original demo tape and many incredible studio outtakes including lost tunes like Fireman's Friend and Backseat Boogie (a project I think I instigated when I lent Billy Miller two CD's worth of un-issued Dictators stuff, still in the vault are tunes like Too Much Fun and Tits To You as well as a killer Interstellar Overdrive). &nbsp;Andy was also the guiding light behind Dictators spin-off Manitoba's Wild Kingdom, fronted the Bel-airs and the Master Plan (with the Fleshtones' Keith Streng), co-wrote tunes with Joey Ramone (for both the Ramones and Joey's solo album), produced a bunch of bands, &nbsp;and was involved in dozens of other projects that slip my mind at the moment (including a second career as a punk sommelier).<br />
I bring this up to you because I happened to wander into my own bar (<a href="http://www.lakesidelounge.com/">Lakeside Lounge</a>, 162 Ave B., NYC) two Wednesdays in a row (a rare occurrence these days, I assure you) where Andy currently holds court at 7 PM with his acoustic review, and I have to say, it's the best hour of live entertainment I've seen in eons. &nbsp;The set changes weekly, and Shernoff has an incredibly deep catalog of great tunes to pick from, but I think last week's show which opened with an acoustic reading of Master Race Rock and included Dictators classics' Baby Let's Twist, and Hey Boys, and a beautiful version of Joey Ramone's Don't Think About It was as perfect a set as I've ever seen. &nbsp;In between tunes Shernoff talks about his life and times in rock'n'roll, some of these stories are hilarious (the first Dictators shows), some are touching (the final days of Joey Ramone), some are both (the David Roter story). With free admission and half priced drinks, you really can't possibly go wrong. Andy will also be appearing at the Norton Records 25th Anniversary shindig in November, I'm not sure which night but all four are sold out, so you're either all ready going or you ain't.<br />

<b><br />
</b><br />
I told my old pal Pat that I'd review a book he sent me in the mail- Daniel Beaumont's <i>Preachin' The Blues: The Life &amp; Times Of Son House </i>(Oxford, 2011). This was many months ago and I'm just getting around to it because to be perfectly honest I do not have much to say about Son House. Which does not mean it is not an excellent book, which it is. Although I must admit, I find the most interesting parts of the book are those that deal with Son House's relationship to his "discoverers" and the white blues audience of the 1960's that had expectations of him that he could barely fathom never mind live up to.<br />
For those who are unfamiliar-- Eddie "Son" House Jr (born March 21, 1902, probably in Lyon, Mississippi), was a great Delta blues singer and guitarist who recorded one session for Paramount Records in 1930, and was recorded again in 1941 for the Library of Congress by traveling folklorist Alan Lomax.<br />
He was not heard from again until 1964 when Dick Waterman (who became his manager), Nick Pearls ( a collector who would go on to found Yazoo Records) and Phil Spiro found him living in Rochester, N.Y., &nbsp;this "rediscovery" happening after they had searched the Delta looking for clues.<br />
To backtrack, House grew up in the Delta and began his career as an entertainer preaching the gospel.<br />
As a young man he fell under the spell of the great Charley Patton, got himself a guitar and began playing the blues. He soon struck up a partnership with Patton's sometime accompanist Willie Brown, and it was through Patton's patronage he recorded for Paramount in 1930. Paramount issued four 78 RPM records: &nbsp;My Black Mama <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-06%20My%20Black%20Mama,%20Pt.%201.mp3">pt 1</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-07%20My%20Black%20Mama,%20Pt.%202.mp3">pt 2</a>, Dry Spell Blues <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-10%20Dry%20Spell%20Blues,%20Pt.%201.mp3">pt 1</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-11%20Dry%20Spell%20Blues,%20Pt.%202.mp3">pt 2</a>, Preachin' The Blues<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-08%20Preachin'%20The%20Blues,%20Pt.%201.mp3"> pt 1</a> b/w<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-09%20Preachin'%20The%20Blues,%20Pt.%202.mp3"> pt 2 </a>and<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/16%20Clarksdale%20Moan.mp3"> Clarksdale Moan </a>b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/15%20Mississippi%20Country%20Farm%20Blues.mp3">Mississippi County Farm Blues</a>. The latter two discs are so rare that only one known copy of each exist (and the latter didn't surface until the 21st Century), the other two are<br />
considered more common with four known copies of each. A single copy of a test pressing of <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-05%20Walkin'%20Blues.mp3">Walking Blues </a>was found in someones garbage in the 1980's. In forty years of collecting I've never seen a Son House 78, have you? These are the discs that House's reputation is based on, and they are among the finest examples of the type of blues played in the Mississippi Delta in the late 20's and early 30's ever recorded. That said, they are a bit hard to listen to since the copies that survived are so worn out (and Paramounts never sound that great anyway) as there is more &nbsp;surface noise than &nbsp;music left in the discs and to listen to them is like hearing someone playing down the block while someone else holds a pan of frying bacon next to your ear. Although in recent years the sonic quality of the tranfers has improved dramatically. &nbsp;Personally I've always preferred the 1941 Library of Congress recordings because you can actually hear the music, not to mention the version of &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/03%20Walking%20Blues%20band%20version.mp3">Walking Blues</a> cut with a rocking little string band that remains the best example of what a Saturday night frolic might have sounded like full swing. &nbsp;Since House had a limited repertoire all the same tunes appear on the 41 sessions, albeit with different titles, I especially like the version of<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Levee%20Camp%20Blues.mp3"> Levee Camp Blues</a>.<br />
House has been criticised, most notably by the late Stephen Calt in his biography of Charley Patton for playing out of tune, but I tend to agree with Jim Dickinson that tuning is a "European and decadent concept", out of tune didn't hurt Chuck Berry.<br />
After leaving the Delta, House lived in Detroit and Rochester, worked outside of music, and eventually disappeared into the woodwork until he was found and coaxed back into playing in 1964, and here lies the meat of Beaumont's book. He digs up much new info, including a self defense killing in Long Island in the 50's, and a new source of House information in the guise of Mississippi born, Rochester blues singer Joe Beard who was close to House and who had a very different take on who House was than his new found white keepers. There's lots of interesting asides, including that House was in the audience when the Rolling Stones brought Howlin' Wolf out on an episode of the<i> Shindig </i>TV show in '65, and House's manager being told by fellow human archaeologist Tom Hoskins (who found Mississippi John Hurt)-"What you have on your hands is a <i>nigger</i>". &nbsp;That House would confound all their expectations by not giving a fuck, about the blues, or his white audience, may seem natural from our vantage point, but to his keepers he remained an enigma. And that's what makes this book such a fun read.<br />
Son House is probably best remembered for being a key musical inspiration to Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson,&nbsp;(the latter connection even led to him being signed by Columbia). I wonder how many people who sight his name have even heard the Paramount and L.O.C. sides? &nbsp;Myself, I hadn't given him a listen in years, my own tastes in such things leaning more towards Leroy Carr, Geechie Wiley &amp; Elvie Thomas (about whom nothing is known), and Charley Patton, but digging out his discs for this posting, I must say, they sure sound good. This music is nearly a century old, so it's quite amazing not just that it survived, but that it is more popular and accessible than it ever was. And that, Pat, is the best I can do for your book review.";s:4:"link";s:55:"http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/son-house.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (The Hound)";s:7:"summary";s:7195:"<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8jN5vqEyV7g" width="420"></iframe><br />

There's lots of interesting asides, including that House was in the audience when the Rolling Stones brought Howlin' Wolf out on an episode of the<i> Shindig </i>TV show in '65, and House's manager being told by fellow human archaeologist Tom Hoskins (who found Mississippi John Hurt)-"What you have on your hands is a <i>nigger</i>". &nbsp;That House would confound all their expectations by not giving a fuck, about the blues, or his white audience, may seem natural from our vantage point, but to his keepers he remained an enigma. And that's what makes this book such a fun read.<br />
Son House is probably best remembered for being a key musical inspiration to Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson,&nbsp;(the latter connection even led to him being signed by Columbia). I wonder how many people who sight his name have even heard the Paramount and L.O.C. sides? &nbsp;Myself, I hadn't given him a listen in years, my own tastes in such things leaning more towards Leroy Carr, Geechie Wiley &amp; Elvie Thomas (about whom nothing is known), and Charley Patton, but digging out his discs for this posting, I must say, they sure sound good. This music is nearly a century old, so it's quite amazing not just that it survived, but that it is more popular and accessible than it ever was. And that, Pat, is the best I can do for your book review.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1319126460;}i:8;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3226924615283203864.post-8921628326922772146";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 08 Sep 2011 22:49:00 +0000";s:8:"category";s:25:"Gillian's Found Photo #66";s:5:"title";s:25:"Gillian's Found Photo #66";s:11:"description";s:1048:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-whyO3WYt8Fs/TmlEdarVvrI/AAAAAAAACTI/hdZrJq6yRtQ/s1600/turban.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-whyO3WYt8Fs/TmlEdarVvrI/AAAAAAAACTI/hdZrJq6yRtQ/s320/turban.jpg" width="210" /></a></div><br />

<br />
&nbsp;Packy Axton (born Charles Axton, &nbsp;Febuary 17, 1941 in Memphis), was, as Jim Dickinson once put it-- "one of the most transracial individuals I've ever met". The son of Everett and Estelle Axton and nephew of Jim Stewart, his family owned and ran Stax (originally Satellite) Records. A white kid who loved R&amp;B and rock'n'roll, Packy cut his teeth playing his tenor sax along with fellow Messick High School students Steve Cropper, Charlie Freeman, Duck Dunn, and Terry Johnson in a band called the Royal Spades (Axton trading in his guitar for a tenor saxophone to join because they already had two guitarists). The Royal Spades, who eventually configured into the group pictured above, where white kids in thrall of The "5" Royales (Cropper has just released a tribute to The "5" Royales album which I've not heard), the Midnighters, Jimmy Reed (Cropper with a harmonica on a rack for the Reed tunes), Ray Charles and other classic R&amp;B acts of the era. When Packy Axton's mom and uncle started up a record label and store in Memphis, the Royal Spades became the right guys in the right place at the right time. &nbsp;Cropper, Axton and who knows what other members of the group along with some local black session players ended up playing on <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/1-06%20Last%20Night.mp3">Last Night</a>, credited to the Mar-Keys, one of the all time great R&amp;B instrumentals, basically just a dumb but funky riff played over and over again with a bridge thrown in (the master was spliced together from two takes), when it rocketed to the top of the charts in the summer of '61, the Royal Spades (now with Smoochie Smith on piano and Wayne Jackson on trumpet, Freeman long gone) hit the road, becoming the Mar-Keys. &nbsp;The Mar-Keys hit the chitlin' circuit and worked it for awhile until the group's leader--Steve Cropper quit in a power struggle with Axton (to be replaced by Charlie Freeman), &nbsp;and returned to Memphis and work in the studio. He'd soon to form Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s whose Green Onions remains the high water mark for R&amp;B instrumentals to this day. Axton carried on as leader of the Mar-Keys for a bit before handing the band over to Freeman.<br />
All my way of introducing you to the best thing to come through the mail slot in ages--<i> Charles 'Packy' Axton-- Late Late Party 1965-67 </i>(<a href="http://lightintheattic.net/">Light In The Attic</a>), a collection of Packy's best post Mar-Keys sides, seventeen Memphis soul instrumentals in the solid Booker T &amp; the MG's /Mar-Keys groove, and not a dud amongst them.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Post Mar-Keys, Packy was something of an outcast at Stax since he didn't get along with Cropper or his uncle Jim Stewart, and in 1965, along with guitarist Bongo Johnny Keyes hit the west coast, where (oddly enough) with the Stax team in support scored a hit with the Packers' <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20Hole%20In%20The%20Wall.mp3">Hole In The Wall </a>(Pure Soul), then returned to Memphis to cuts sides as the Martinis', including the inebriation classic <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/03%20Hung%20Over.mp3">Hung Over </a>(24 Karat)&nbsp;where he can be heard barfing, the The Pack-Keys, and L.H. &amp; the Memphis Sounds. &nbsp;The best of these post Stax recordings are collected on said disc including such rarities as Greasy Pumpkin by the Pac-Keys, Late Late Party by the Martinis and Out Of Control by L.H. &amp; the Memphis Sounds.<br />
&nbsp; Packy was a libertine and a wild man. "Packy was a playboy. He was a mama's boy....Packy was allowed to do what &nbsp;Packy wanted to do" remembered Cropper. &nbsp;His inability to get along with Cropper, Jim Stewart and Chips Moman effectively made him persona non grata at Stax by the time the golden era arrived, and he never really got over it. Packy Axton drank himself into an early grave, he died in 1974. &nbsp;In Peter Guralnick's<i> Sweet Soul Music</i> (Harper &amp; Row, 1986), still the best book on the subject,&nbsp;he comes off as sort of an evil hipster, the devilish alter ego to the ambitious and pragmatic Cropper.&nbsp;This, the first CD issued under his own name stands proudly next to the best of the early Mar-Keys and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s. &nbsp;Packy may not have been what you would call a great musician (is there anything duller?), but he had something; a flair, a style, and an ability to keep it simple (some times moronically so, in the best possible way), that made for great R&amp;B sides.<br />

</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Nick Tosches has long been a, make that, the, most perspicacious observer of what is left of, dare I say it? Popular culture.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">His latest book <i>Save The Last Dance For Satan</i>, published by Brooklyn paperback powerhouse <a href="http://www.nortonrecords.com/kicksbooks/tosches.php">Kicks Books</a>&nbsp;(and perfume company)&nbsp;is essential reading not just for anyone who wants to know something about the history of rock'n'roll when it was actually fun, but as to why it no longer exists in today's world. Both the rock'n'roll and the fun.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Expanded from a magazine article written for a publication so trite I refuse to type its name,<i> Save The Last Dance For Satan</i> examines the characters behind the scenes in the early days of rock'n'roll who were said to be "connected". Old Town's colorful Hy Weiss, motor mouth Philadelphia DJ Jerry "The Geator With The Heater" Blavant, &nbsp;one time promo man (and later Madonna and Jacko's manager) Freddie DeMann, &nbsp;Morris "Moishe" Levy, George Goldner, a guy named Wassel, &nbsp;a guy named Bruno, and the true story of the Jaynettes' ethereal classic Sally Go Round The Roses, are all present and accounted for. I shall not ruin what I promise is a quick and gainful reading experience by telling you what it actually says about them in its pages, but you will learn how made guys and degenerate gamblers, girls who spell their name Lezli and guys who wore Velour jump suits, and of course Wassel and Bruno, &nbsp;all colluded to perpetrate that music we remember as the real thing. The good shit. Rock'n'roll. And oh yeah, the pussy eating contest. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">As our world falls apart around us (Says Nick-- "<i>I give it two years...at most</i>"), and we watch those both at the top and at the bottom, both too dumb to and figure out where it all went wrong, scratch their assholes and moan; I quote from<i> Save The Last Dance For Satan</i>:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><i>The true gage of the freedom of any community is the measurement of the degree of equality by which the fruits of malfeasance are shared by the rulers and the ruled, the cop on the beat and the man or woman on the street. The essence of democracy, as of capitalism is corruption. Only when the criminal in blue and the criminal in mufti, the peddler and the priest and the alderman and the drunkard--only when they are neighbors of common root and conspiracy is any neighborhood safe for the old lady on the stoop on a hot summer night, only then is there true charity, only then is there a justice that is real, and only then is there life in the air. As the social clubs close, so the churches empty. This is fact, not metaphor".</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Amen.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Nick Tosches will be reading from his latest work on Friday, September 9, at the Jefferson Market Library (425 Sixth Ave at 10th Street, New York City) at 8 PM, admission is free. &nbsp;Tosches perfume (I kid you not) will be for sale.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In other Nick news, an article in Variety reported that art oaf Julian Schnabel will be directing Johnny Depp in a feature film version of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Dante-Novel-Nick-Tosches/dp/0316895245">In The Hand Of Dante</a></i>.

</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Nick Tosches has long been a, make that, the, most perspicacious observer of what is left of, dare I say it? Popular culture.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">His latest book <i>Save The Last Dance For Satan</i>, published by Brooklyn paperback powerhouse <a href="http://www.nortonrecords.com/kicksbooks/tosches.php">Kicks Books</a>&nbsp;(and perfume company)&nbsp;is essential reading not just for anyone who wants to know something about the history of rock'n'roll when it was actually fun, but as to why it no longer exists in today's world. Both the rock'n'roll and the fun.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Expanded from a magazine article written for a publication so trite I refuse to type its name,<i> Save The Last Dance For Satan</i> examines the characters behind the scenes in the early days of rock'n'roll who were said to be "connected". Old Town's colorful Hy Weiss, motor mouth Philadelphia DJ Jerry "The Geator With The Heater" Blavant, &nbsp;one time promo man (and later Madonna and Jacko's manager) Freddie DeMann, &nbsp;Morris "Moishe" Levy, George Goldner, a guy named Wassel, &nbsp;a guy named Bruno, and the true story of the Jaynettes' ethereal classic Sally Go Round The Roses, are all present and accounted for. I shall not ruin what I promise is a quick and gainful reading experience by telling you what it actually says about them in its pages, but you will learn how made guys and degenerate gamblers, girls who spell their name Lezli and guys who wore Velour jump suits, and of course Wassel and Bruno, &nbsp;all colluded to perpetrate that music we remember as the real thing. The good shit. Rock'n'roll. And oh yeah, the pussy eating contest. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">As our world falls apart around us (Says Nick-- "<i>I give it two years...at most</i>"), and we watch those both at the top and at the bottom, both too dumb to and figure out where it all went wrong, scratch their assholes and moan; I quote from<i> Save The Last Dance For Satan</i>:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><i>The true gage of the freedom of any community is the measurement of the degree of equality by which the fruits of malfeasance are shared by the rulers and the ruled, the cop on the beat and the man or woman on the street. The essence of democracy, as of capitalism is corruption. Only when the criminal in blue and the criminal in mufti, the peddler and the priest and the alderman and the drunkard--only when they are neighbors of common root and conspiracy is any neighborhood safe for the old lady on the stoop on a hot summer night, only then is there true charity, only then is there a justice that is real, and only then is there life in the air. As the social clubs close, so the churches empty. This is fact, not metaphor".</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Amen.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Nick Tosches will be reading from his latest work on Friday, September 9, at the Jefferson Market Library (425 Sixth Ave at 10th Street, New York City) at 8 PM, admission is free. &nbsp;Tosches perfume (I kid you not) will be for sale.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In other Nick news, an article in Variety reported that art oaf Julian Schnabel will be directing Johnny Depp in a feature film version of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Dante-Novel-Nick-Tosches/dp/0316895245">In The Hand Of Dante</a></i>.

<b>Todd Browning, second from right.&nbsp; </b><br />
If I had to pick an all time favorite movie, it might just be William Cowen's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023101/"><b>Kongo</b></a>, a 1932 re-make of Todd Browning's 1928 <b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019563/">West Of Zanzibar</a></b>. &nbsp;In fact, both titles along with Cecil B. DeMille's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023470/">Sign Of The Cross</a>&nbsp;(making a rare big screen appearance this Sunday in NYC at the Film Forum), make up my top three.<br />
&nbsp; Based on the play by Chester DeVonde &nbsp;and Kilbourn Gordon (which was titled Kongo and was a huge hit on Broadway), <i>West Of Zanzibar</i>/<i>Kongo </i>is one of the most gruesome, sensational and lascivious re-writings of Joseph Conrad's <i>Heart Of Darkness</i> ever unleashed, it makes <i>Apocalypse Now</i> look like a an episode of <i>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle</i>.<br />
&nbsp; The convoluted story line (which starts in London in Browning's version, although Cowen's remake cuts straight to the non-chase in Africa), revolves around a stage magician Dead Legs (the character's given name changes in the two versions from Phroso to Rutledge) who in an altercation over his girl gets his spine crushed and ends up a dead legged cripple. &nbsp;In Browning's version Dead Legs is played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151606/">Lon Chaney</a> (Browning's greatest leading man), in Cowan's by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404158/">Walter Huston</a>&nbsp;(who had played the role on Broadway). &nbsp;Dead Legs follows his rival, Crane (an ivory trader, played by<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000859/"> Lionel Barrymore</a> in the silent), to Africa where he sets himself up as a&nbsp;deity amongst the the natives, controlling them with sugar cubes, tongue twisting torture, and his old stage magic routine disguised as folk religion. &nbsp;When the rival shows up at Dead Legs' hut, the story then moves on to the long lost daughter of the now deceased woman they fought over. Thinking it was his rival's daughter, Dead Legs' takes possession of the girls upbringing, raising her in a sheltered convent only to degrade her in the jungle when she reaches her majority. I won't ruin the plot twist. But there's enough&nbsp;depravity for a dozen sideshows (Browning's specialty), my favorite being <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0892473/">Lupe Velez </a>as an alcoholic jungle nymph in Cowan's version of the story, although how a Mexican spitfire ended up in a shack in the Congo is never explained, I can't say I mind. &nbsp;I give Cowan's version a slight edge for it's incredible dialogue, much of which revolves around the words-- "He sneered". &nbsp;Browning's version looks a bit better, although both have an incredibly claustrophobic, sweltering, disturbing feel, much like Werner Herzog's wonderful soliloquy about the jungle heard in Les Blank's <i>Burden On Dreams</i> ("fornicating, writhing, strangulation,...the birds don't sing so much as scream in pain...."). &nbsp;It's hard to decide who was a better Dead Legs, Chaney has never been less than brilliant, or Huston who really brings something of his own to the role. &nbsp;Either, or. West Of Zanzibar and Kongo are two must see films for anyone who likes their movies twisted, depraved, and sensational. &nbsp;TCM shows them on occasion, or you can watch them in short segments on YouTube.";s:4:"link";s:78:"http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/kongo-1932-west-of-zanzibar-1928.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (The Hound)";s:7:"summary";s:4571:"<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tj6nDJaSY7g" width="425"></iframe><br />

Howlin' Wolf (born Chester Arthur Burnett outside of West Point, Mississippi, June 10, 1910, died January 10, 1976) would have been 101 today, had he lived. If they dug him up and stuck his bones onstage he'd still be better than 99.9% of what passes for blues or rock'n'roll these days. I've already blogged on him before (<a href="http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/howlin-wolf-unseen-footage.html">here</a> and<a href="http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/howlin-wolf.html"> here</a>), so I have little to add, except he remains my very favorite singer, and when ever I hear so and so (name your most overrated singer here) is a great "soul" singer, I want to stick a Howlin' Wolf 78 in their ear. If you are not familiar with Wolf's music, start with his early Chess and RPM sides, then the un-issued Sun Sessions, forget the psychedelic "birdshit" album, the London Sessions and SuperBlues jams unless you are a completist.

<br />
"The best performances never get recorded, the best recordings never get released and the best records don't sell", so proclaimed the late Memphis musician/producer/philosopher Jim Dickinson the last time I saw him alive. Never was that adage so true than in Memphis where Dickinson plied his trade for four decades.<br />
Today's subject, a great Memphis garage band who called themselves The Jesters (not to be mistaken for the Jesters from Brooklyn who covered the Diablos' The Wind, or or the Jim Messina led surf group, or Charley Pickett's cousin Mark Markem &amp; the Jesters who cut the all time classic Marlboro Country or any any of the other dozens of group who had previously used that name) are one of the greatest examples of said truism, even though they did release one of the greatest 45's of the era, and the last great Sun record.<br />
The aforementioned Jim Dickinson is of course, part of the story, since the Jesters' only released platter was as much his record as theirs, although in fact the only time he ever played with the group on whose contribution to the pantheon of sides he sang and pounded piano, was the January 1966 day it was recorded at (the second) Sun Studio (639 Madison) in Memphis.<br />
&nbsp;I, as they say, digress.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jesters were formed in 1964, led by guitarist Edaward LaPaiglia aka Teddy Paige, who had previously led a teenage aggression called the Church Keys, and was heavily into the '5' Royales (then living in Memphis and recording for the Home Of The Blues label),&nbsp;Carl Perkins, Bo Diddley and Freddie King. Paige hooked up with singer Tommy Minga, &nbsp;previously of the Escapades, and added rhythm guitarist Jerry Phillips, son of Sun Records Sam C. (and fresh from a stint as a fake midget wrestler), bassist Bill Wulfers and drummer Eddie Robertson in short order. Their set list was heavy on old blues, R&amp;B and rockabilly tunes as well as originals, some &nbsp;re-writes of classic R&amp;B tunes, some quite unique, and short of British Invasion hits that were the staple on most local white groups at the time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Jerry's older brother Knox Phillips was pretty &nbsp;much running the show at the much diminished Sun Records, Sam was disillusioned and bored with the record biz and preferred to concentrate on his radio stations, and Knox began recording the Jesters. &nbsp;Tapes from two sessions with eleven tracks from the original band have survived, &nbsp;as well as the two sides issue on 45, although these would not see release until the late 1980's when they were first issued on Charley's <i>Sun: Into The 60's </i>box set and later in 2009 on the <a href="http://www.acerecords.co.uk/">Ace</a>/Big Beat CD <i>Cadillac Men:The Sun Masters</i> which added four Escapades tracks to fill out the CD.<br />
&nbsp;The sides with Tommy Minga singing are all first class, snot nosed, garage howlers-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/05%20What's%20The%20Matter%20Baby.mp3">&nbsp;What's The Matter Baby</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/03%20Get%20Gone%20Baby.mp3">Get Gone Baby</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/06%20Strange%20As%20It%20Seems.mp3">Strange As it Seems</a>, the original, Minga fronted version of <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/12%20Cadillac%20Man%20[Alternative%20Version].mp3">Cadillac Man</a>, a version of Bill Doggett's Hold with added lyrics and retitled <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20The%20Big%20Hurt.mp3">The Big Hurt</a>, the '5' Royales Slummer The Slum barely re-written as <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Stompity%20Stomp.mp3">Stompity Stomp</a>, as well as versions of <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/10%20Boppin'%20The%20Blues.mp3">Boppin' The Blues</a>,<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20Night%20Train%20From%20Chicago.mp3"> Night Train From Chicago</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Heartbreak%20Hotel.mp3">Heartbreak Hotel</a> and the Bo Diddley cop--<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20Jim%20Dandy%20And%20Sweet%20Sixteen.mp3"> Jim Dandy and Sweet Sixteen</a>&nbsp;would all fit perfectly on any volume of <i>Back From The Grave </i>(Crypt).&nbsp;Certainly had it been released at the time What's The Matter Baby could have given the Standells, Shadows Of Night, Knickerbokers and other crude hitmakers of that year a run for their Beatle boots.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How and why Tommy Minga's voice was deemed unsuitable for issued wax is unclear, but once it was decided to bring Jim Dickinson in on piano and lead vocals, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/04%20Cadillac%20Man.mp3">Cadillac Man</a> was transformed into another creature all together. Rather than a snarling, Them/Rolling Stones styled garage rocker, it became a throw back to an earlier era at Sun, that of full throated screamers like Sonny Burgess and Billy Lee Riley. Sam Phillips was said to be highly excited by the possibilities, and secured Jim Dickinson (who had previously cut two singles under the tutelage of Sun alumni Bill Justis) contract release and put the band back in the studio to cut a b-side, a version of Little Walter's <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/09%20My%20Babe.mp3">My Babe</a> (itself a version of Sister Rosette Tharpe's version&nbsp;of the old gospel standard This Train). Cadillac Man b/w My Babe was issued by Sun in 1966 and died&nbsp;a quick death. &nbsp;In a year ('66) that saw the Shadows of Night, 13th Floor Elevators and Standells hit the charts, the Dickinson led version of Cadillac Man had probably less commercial appeal than the material cut with Tommy Minga singing. It was also the beginning of the end for the Jesters. There would be no follow up.&nbsp;At some point they recorded a version of Smokey Robinson's <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/14%20What's%20So%20Good%20About%20Goodbye.mp3">What So Good About Goodbye</a> with Jimmy Day singing, but it too sat on the shelf for decades.<br />
&nbsp;The band, with Minga&nbsp;back in front, briefly resumed gigging, but soon fell apart. Lack of success had halted their forward motion, and when a rock'n'roll group is not moving forward, it is dying.<br />
&nbsp;By late '66 it was over for the Jesters, Tommy Minga put together a new version of the Escapades. They released two singles I Tell No Lies (issued on both Arbert and XL) and <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/17%20Mad,%20Mad,%20Mad.mp3">Mad Mad Mad</a> (Verve) both in late '66.&nbsp;Teddy Paige played some sessions, ending up on discs by David Allen Coe and Cliff Jackson, left music to work construction and eventually relocated to the U.K where he was said to have taken to wandering around in medieval minstrel garb, complete with saber. He was briefly institutionalized in the nineties after a run in between said sword and a neighbor. &nbsp;Jerry Phillips would find work at the family radio stations, the other two got real jobs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jesters were among the best and most unique garage bands in that peak year for garage band rock'n'roll. Paige's guitar playing is especially noteworthy, he works in quotes from Lowman Pauling, Freddie King, and Bo Diddley, yet still retained a unique and biting sound.

<br />
"The best performances never get recorded, the best recordings never get released and the best records don't sell", so proclaimed the late Memphis musician/producer/philosopher Jim Dickinson the last time I saw him alive. Never was that adage so true than in Memphis where Dickinson plied his trade for four decades.<br />
Today's subject, a great Memphis garage band who called themselves The Jesters (not to be mistaken for the Jesters from Brooklyn who covered the Diablos' The Wind, or or the Jim Messina led surf group, or Charley Pickett's cousin Mark Markem &amp; the Jesters who cut the all time classic Marlboro Country or any any of the other dozens of group who had previously used that name) are one of the greatest examples of said truism, even though they did release one of the greatest 45's of the era, and the last great Sun record.<br />
The aforementioned Jim Dickinson is of course, part of the story, since the Jesters' only released platter was as much his record as theirs, although in fact the only time he ever played with the group on whose contribution to the pantheon of sides he sang and pounded piano, was the January 1966 day it was recorded at (the second) Sun Studio (639 Madison) in Memphis.<br />
&nbsp;I, as they say, digress.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jesters were formed in 1964, led by guitarist Edaward LaPaiglia aka Teddy Paige, who had previously led a teenage aggression called the Church Keys, and was heavily into the '5' Royales (then living in Memphis and recording for the Home Of The Blues label),&nbsp;Carl Perkins, Bo Diddley and Freddie King. Paige hooked up with singer Tommy Minga, &nbsp;previously of the Escapades, and added rhythm guitarist Jerry Phillips, son of Sun Records Sam C. (and fresh from a stint as a fake midget wrestler), bassist Bill Wulfers and drummer Eddie Robertson in short order. Their set list was heavy on old blues, R&amp;B and rockabilly tunes as well as originals, some &nbsp;re-writes of classic R&amp;B tunes, some quite unique, and short of British Invasion hits that were the staple on most local white groups at the time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Jerry's older brother Knox Phillips was pretty &nbsp;much running the show at the much diminished Sun Records, Sam was disillusioned and bored with the record biz and preferred to concentrate on his radio stations, and Knox began recording the Jesters. &nbsp;Tapes from two sessions with eleven tracks from the original band have survived, &nbsp;as well as the two sides issue on 45, although these would not see release until the late 1980's when they were first issued on Charley's <i>Sun: Into The 60's </i>box set and later in 2009 on the <a href="http://www.acerecords.co.uk/">Ace</a>/Big Beat CD <i>Cadillac Men:The Sun Masters</i> which added four Escapades tracks to fill out the CD.<br />
&nbsp;The sides with Tommy Minga singing are all first class, snot nosed, garage howlers-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/05%20What's%20The%20Matter%20Baby.mp3">&nbsp;What's The Matter Baby</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/03%20Get%20Gone%20Baby.mp3">Get Gone Baby</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/06%20Strange%20As%20It%20Seems.mp3">Strange As it Seems</a>, the original, Minga fronted version of <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/12%20Cadillac%20Man%20[Alternative%20Version].mp3">Cadillac Man</a>, a version of Bill Doggett's Hold with added lyrics and retitled <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20The%20Big%20Hurt.mp3">The Big Hurt</a>, the '5' Royales Slummer The Slum barely re-written as <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Stompity%20Stomp.mp3">Stompity Stomp</a>, as well as versions of <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/10%20Boppin'%20The%20Blues.mp3">Boppin' The Blues</a>,<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20Night%20Train%20From%20Chicago.mp3"> Night Train From Chicago</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Heartbreak%20Hotel.mp3">Heartbreak Hotel</a> and the Bo Diddley cop--<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20Jim%20Dandy%20And%20Sweet%20Sixteen.mp3"> Jim Dandy and Sweet Sixteen</a>&nbsp;would all fit perfectly on any volume of <i>Back From The Grave </i>(Crypt).&nbsp;Certainly had it been released at the time What's The Matter Baby could have given the Standells, Shadows Of Night, Knickerbokers and other crude hitmakers of that year a run for their Beatle boots.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How and why Tommy Minga's voice was deemed unsuitable for issued wax is unclear, but once it was decided to bring Jim Dickinson in on piano and lead vocals, <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/04%20Cadillac%20Man.mp3">Cadillac Man</a> was transformed into another creature all together. Rather than a snarling, Them/Rolling Stones styled garage rocker, it became a throw back to an earlier era at Sun, that of full throated screamers like Sonny Burgess and Billy Lee Riley. Sam Phillips was said to be highly excited by the possibilities, and secured Jim Dickinson (who had previously cut two singles under the tutelage of Sun alumni Bill Justis) contract release and put the band back in the studio to cut a b-side, a version of Little Walter's <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/09%20My%20Babe.mp3">My Babe</a> (itself a version of Sister Rosette Tharpe's version&nbsp;of the old gospel standard This Train). Cadillac Man b/w My Babe was issued by Sun in 1966 and died&nbsp;a quick death. &nbsp;In a year ('66) that saw the Shadows of Night, 13th Floor Elevators and Standells hit the charts, the Dickinson led version of Cadillac Man had probably less commercial appeal than the material cut with Tommy Minga singing. It was also the beginning of the end for the Jesters. There would be no follow up.&nbsp;At some point they recorded a version of Smokey Robinson's <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/14%20What's%20So%20Good%20About%20Goodbye.mp3">What So Good About Goodbye</a> with Jimmy Day singing, but it too sat on the shelf for decades.<br />
&nbsp;The band, with Minga&nbsp;back in front, briefly resumed gigging, but soon fell apart. Lack of success had halted their forward motion, and when a rock'n'roll group is not moving forward, it is dying.<br />
&nbsp;By late '66 it was over for the Jesters, Tommy Minga put together a new version of the Escapades. They released two singles I Tell No Lies (issued on both Arbert and XL) and <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/17%20Mad,%20Mad,%20Mad.mp3">Mad Mad Mad</a> (Verve) both in late '66.&nbsp;Teddy Paige played some sessions, ending up on discs by David Allen Coe and Cliff Jackson, left music to work construction and eventually relocated to the U.K where he was said to have taken to wandering around in medieval minstrel garb, complete with saber. He was briefly institutionalized in the nineties after a run in between said sword and a neighbor. &nbsp;Jerry Phillips would find work at the family radio stations, the other two got real jobs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jesters were among the best and most unique garage bands in that peak year for garage band rock'n'roll. Paige's guitar playing is especially noteworthy, he works in quotes from Lowman Pauling, Freddie King, and Bo Diddley, yet still retained a unique and biting sound. Tommy Minga too had his own style, having perfected the requisite&nbsp;'teenager with hard on who hates his parents' delivery.

He had an loose, almost swinging rock'n'roll sound, he had an amazing voice and was an excellent tunesmith, writing nearly all his own best sides. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;At age ten his family relocated across the border to&nbsp;Hazel Oak, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and it was hear he formed his first band-- the Southern Drifters, playing country and rockabilly. His first session came in early 1957 at Detroit's Universal Studio, it produced <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Greaseball.mp3">&nbsp;Greaseball</a> (an early version of Leroy which remained unreleased until the 90's) and four sides that were picked up by the ABC/Paramount label and make up his first two singles--</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Baby%20She's%20Gone(abc).mp3">Baby She's Gone</a> b/w You Can Bet Your Bottom Dollar, his debut, followed later in the year by <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Two%20Timin'%20Woman.mp3">Two Timin' Woman</a> b/w I Need Your Love, both singles are in the moody, Elvis mode. The primitive thumper Baby She's Gone is the best of the four sides with it's &nbsp;foreboding, nearly ominous throb, and killer guitar solo by Al Allen (which Robert Quine would steal part of and insert into punk anthem Blank Generation twenty years later). It was around this time he hooked up with bass player Stan Getz (not the jazz saxophonist) and his Tom Cats who would be his backing band for the next year or so (and later go on to even greater obscurity as Johnny Powers' band). &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In the spring of '58 Scott, who had made some local waves was signed to Carlton Records and was back in the studio, recording his first real hit <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/12%20My%20True%20Love.mp3">My True Love</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Leroy.mp3">Leroy</a> (both sides making the Billboard charts with the a-side rising to #3), and the follow up-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20With%20Your%20Love.mp3">With Your Love</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/09%20Geraldine.mp3">Geraldine</a>, a lesser hit, rising to #28 and kicking off a six single backwards chart run that would take him through the end of '58 with &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/14%20Goodbye%20Baby.mp3">Goodbye Baby</a> b/w Save My Soul (#8), <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20The%20Way%20I%20Walk.mp3">The Way I Walk</a> b/w &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20Midgie.mp3">Midgie </a>(#38), I Never Felt Like This b/w Bella (#78) and There Comes A Time b/w Baby Marie (#71). Carlton also issued his first LP,</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">ten of its twelve titles being originals, including all his 45's, it was even issued in true stereo, vocals and guitars on one side, bass and drums on the other, it's a great record to practice guitar playing to because you can put the balance all the way to once side and play along with the rhythm section. The stereo pressing have the word Stereo written vertically down the left side of the jacket in press on felt block letters. It's probably the first stereo rock'n'roll LP ever released.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;Jack Scott was drafted in 1959 and he'd spend most of the year in the U.S. Army, Carlton releasing lesser sides and a second LP to keep his name alive. Later that year upon his discharge he left Carlton and signed with another small company- Top Rank.

He had an loose, almost swinging rock'n'roll sound, he had an amazing voice and was an excellent tunesmith, writing nearly all his own best sides. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;At age ten his family relocated across the border to&nbsp;Hazel Oak, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and it was hear he formed his first band-- the Southern Drifters, playing country and rockabilly. His first session came in early 1957 at Detroit's Universal Studio, it produced <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Greaseball.mp3">&nbsp;Greaseball</a> (an early version of Leroy which remained unreleased until the 90's) and four sides that were picked up by the ABC/Paramount label and make up his first two singles--</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20Baby%20She's%20Gone(abc).mp3">Baby She's Gone</a> b/w You Can Bet Your Bottom Dollar, his debut, followed later in the year by <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Two%20Timin'%20Woman.mp3">Two Timin' Woman</a> b/w I Need Your Love, both singles are in the moody, Elvis mode. The primitive thumper Baby She's Gone is the best of the four sides with it's &nbsp;foreboding, nearly ominous throb, and killer guitar solo by Al Allen (which Robert Quine would steal part of and insert into punk anthem Blank Generation twenty years later). It was around this time he hooked up with bass player Stan Getz (not the jazz saxophonist) and his Tom Cats who would be his backing band for the next year or so (and later go on to even greater obscurity as Johnny Powers' band). &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In the spring of '58 Scott, who had made some local waves was signed to Carlton Records and was back in the studio, recording his first real hit <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/12%20My%20True%20Love.mp3">My True Love</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Leroy.mp3">Leroy</a> (both sides making the Billboard charts with the a-side rising to #3), and the follow up-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20With%20Your%20Love.mp3">With Your Love</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/09%20Geraldine.mp3">Geraldine</a>, a lesser hit, rising to #28 and kicking off a six single backwards chart run that would take him through the end of '58 with &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/14%20Goodbye%20Baby.mp3">Goodbye Baby</a> b/w Save My Soul (#8), <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20The%20Way%20I%20Walk.mp3">The Way I Walk</a> b/w &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20Midgie.mp3">Midgie </a>(#38), I Never Felt Like This b/w Bella (#78) and There Comes A Time b/w Baby Marie (#71). Carlton also issued his first LP,</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">ten of its twelve titles being originals, including all his 45's, it was even issued in true stereo, vocals and guitars on one side, bass and drums on the other, it's a great record to practice guitar playing to because you can put the balance all the way to once side and play along with the rhythm section. The stereo pressing have the word Stereo written vertically down the left side of the jacket in press on felt block letters. It's probably the first stereo rock'n'roll LP ever released.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;Jack Scott was drafted in 1959 and he'd spend most of the year in the U.S. Army, Carlton releasing lesser sides and a second LP to keep his name alive. Later that year upon his discharge he left Carlton and signed with another small company- Top Rank. By this late date, in order to survive rockers, following in Elvis' footsteps (whose first post-Army single was the re-write of Mario Lanza's version of O Sole Mia-- It's Now Or Never), had to become ballad singers (Roy Orbison, Conway Twitty,The Everly Brothers) or watch their careers wither (Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins).&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Scott who always excelled at ballads had no problem adjusting and topped the charts with the ballado-profundo What In The World's Come Over You (#5 Pop), although the flip side was a rocker <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/06%20Baby,%20Baby.mp3">Baby Baby</a>.&nbsp;He followed it with another weeper-- Burning Bridges which became his biggest ever hit, rising to #3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosco Gordon Jr. was born in Memphis in 1934, the youngest of eight children, growing up on Florida Street. He taught himself piano by sitting next to his sister while she practiced her lessons and before the age of eighteen had won the Talent Show at Beale Street's famed Palace Theater (the M.C. was Rufus Thomas) and was appearing on WDIA, America's first all black radio station (where B.B. King got his start around the same time). Through WDIA's owner James Mattis he was sent to see Sam C. Phillips who recorded him, leasing his sides to the Bihari Brother' RPM label out of L.A., charting for the first time with <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/05%20Saddled%20The%20Cow%20(And%20Milked%20The%20Horse).mp3">Saddled &nbsp;The Cow (Milked The Horse</a>) b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/04%20Ouch!%20Pretty%20Baby.mp3">Ouch! Pretty Baby </a>which went to #9 R&amp;B in September of '51. &nbsp;Then Phillips sent two versions of the same master-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Booted.mp3">Booted</a>, one to RPM and a slightly different alternate take to Chess in Chicago. &nbsp;The Chess version hit #1 R&amp;B in February of '52 kicking off a three way tug of war which ended up with RPM securing Gordon's contract (and the services of talent scout/band leader Ike Turner who had topped the charts for Chess with the Phillips produced master Rocket 88 under the guise of Jackie Breston &amp; his Delta Cats, Chess would get Howlin' Wolf in the same deal). &nbsp;Since RPM was no longer dealing with Phillips, Gordon cut sessions in Memphis at Tuff Green's house in a makeshift studio, moonlighting for Phillips who then sold the masters to Mattis' Duke label. Soon Duke was sold to Peacock's owner, Don Robey, along with Gordon, Bobby Blue Bland (who was Rosco's chauffeur, he made his debut singing on a Rosco Gordon b-side), and Johnny Ace. Confused?&nbsp;Don't worry you will be.<br />
&nbsp;Since Rosco had two top ten hits and had seen no royalties (and the Biharis had cut themselves in for a piece of his songwriting by putting their nome-de-disque Taub on all his discs), Rosco Gordon took the short money upfront, and hence would cut a disc for whom ever was willing to put his price (usually $3-400) in his pocket. Between the years of 1951-59 he cut eleven singles for RPM (including the #2 hit <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/01%20No%20More%20Doggin'.mp3">No More Doggin</a>'), eight for Duke, five for Sun (the biggest seller <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/07%20Chicken%20(Dance%20With%20You).mp3">The Chicken </a>appearing on both Sun and its subsidiary Flip), one for Chess (the aforementioned Booted), and four more for Vee Jay, including his biggest hit-- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/04%20Just%20a%20Little%20Bit%20vj.mp3">Just A Little Bit</a>,&nbsp;featuring <a href="http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/classie-ballou.html">Classie Ballou</a> on guitar,&nbsp;which would go on to become an R&amp;B standard.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a daunting and quite pointless task to attempt to put these twenty-nine discs in any sort of chronological order. In fact, much of the best material was left in Sam Phillips' vault which remained un-issued until the early 1980's when Charley Records (a rumored money laundering operation for the Corsican mob) began releasing un-issued Sun recordings in bulk. &nbsp;The basic Rosco Gordon sound was based around his piano pounding (known as Roscoe's rhythm), shuffling drums, guttural saxophone and often distorted guitars, over which Rosco usually delivered a wonderfully mush mouthed vocal. In addition to the above sides, some of his best were, and still are-- &nbsp;RPM 322- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/02%20Rosco's%20Boogie.mp3">Rosco's Boogie</a> b/w So Tired, &nbsp;Duke 129- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/three%20cent%20love.mp3">Three Cent Love</a> b/w&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/you%20figure%20it%20out.mp3">You Figure It Out</a>, the a-side sporting a beautiful solo from Pat Hare, the flip perhaps his most over the top vocal, RPM 358- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/11%20New%20Orleans%20Wimmen.mp3">New Orleans Wimmen </a>b/w What You Got On Your Mind, Sun (and Flip) 227- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/4-18%20Weeping%20Blues%20(1955).mp3">Weeping Blues</a> b/w<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/08%20Love%20for%20You%20Baby.mp3"> Love For You Baby</a>, Sun 257-<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/15%20Shoobie%20Oobie.mp3"> Shoobie Oobie</a> b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/16%20Cheese%20and%20Crackers.mp3">Cheese and Crackers</a>, Sun 305 <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/20%20Sally%20Jo.mp3">Sally Joe </a>b/w <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/3-04%20Torro.mp3">El Torro</a> (the a-side an experiment in rockabilly, the flip an uncharacteristic Spanish guitar led instrumental that is rarely re-issued but I love), RPM 369-<a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/15%20Dream%20Baby%20aka%20Dream%20On%20Baby.mp3"> Dream On Baby</a> b/w &nbsp;Trying RPM 384- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/22%20We're%20All%20Loaded%20(Whiskey%20Made%20Me%20Drunk).mp3">Whiskey Made Me Drunk</a> b/w Tomorrow May Be Too Late, Duke 173- <a href="http://blogs.loisaida.net/09%20Tummer%20Tee.mp3">Tummer Tee</a> b/w I've Loved and I've Lost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosco Gordon had a colorful career. In one run in with hoodlum label owner Don Robey, Robey threatened to kick Gordon (he'd previously crushed Little Richard's testicles in an argument over royalties). Gordon patted the revolver tucked into his belt and told Robey the foot he kicked him with was the foot he would put a bullet in. He escaped with his testes in tact. &nbsp;He toured the south on many package shows, relocated to Shreveport, La. in the late 50's where he met his second wife Barbara (his first marriage at age 15 lasted only weeks), and kept churning out discs. He also toured the Caribbean where he was wildly popular, No More Doggin' being one of the biggest R&amp;B hits in Jamaican history and along with Fats Domino's Be My Guest and Wilbert Harrison's Kansas City, the blueprint for the coming ska sound. He also appeared in one of the greatest rock'n'roll movies of all time-- <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050908/">Rock Baby Rock It</a>&nbsp;(1957) along with rocker Johnny Carroll, in it Gordon serenades his pet chicken Butch (he later told me Butch, whom he toured with, was an alcoholic).<br />
&nbsp;In the late 60's he relocated to Queens, New York, where he founded his own Bab-Roc label issuing a handful of singles in the 70's and then, in the style of TV's George Jefferson, opened a dry cleaners. He kept performing till the end of his life and was in fine form as late as the millennium. He recorded an album for ska pioneer Clement "Sir Coxone" Dodd &nbsp;in the 90's, it wasn't particularly good, but I was thrilled to meet Dodd who was selling the discs from a cardboard box at the back of one of Gordon's gigs in Brooklyn. &nbsp;In his final days Rosco Gordon attempted to patch things up with Sam Phillips who took great offense to Rosco's disregard of exclusive contracts (even though Phillips had operated much the same way at the dawn of his career) and still harbored a grudge. &nbsp;In 2000 Rosco booked time at Sun Studio and asked Sam to produce a few sides. Rosco recorded an album at Sun but Phillips never showed. It was issued as <i>Memphis, Tennessee</i> later that year. &nbsp;In 2002 Rosco Gordon died of a heart attack in Rego Park, Queens, New York. Perhaps if life on earth continues for long enough, someone will compile a re-issue of his complete Duke sides.";s:4:"link";s:58:"http://thehoundblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/rosco-gordon.html";s:6:"author";s:31:"noreply@blogger.com (The Hound)";s:7:"summary";s:13458:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DZ0wNUP_CoM/TbvRHCiw3LI/AAAAAAAACO8/E6Asr3CSVP0/s1600/roscogordon.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DZ0wNUP_CoM/TbvRHCiw3LI/AAAAAAAACO8/E6Asr3CSVP0/s1600/roscogordon.jpeg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>Rosco Gordon</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br />
