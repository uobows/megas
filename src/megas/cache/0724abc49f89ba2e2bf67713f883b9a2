<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">There were just 28 Indigenous registered architects at the last Census ? an increase of one since the national head count five years earlier.</p>
<p>With Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples representing 3 per cent of the population, the number should be closer to 500. But Indigenous architects make up just 0.2 per cent of the roughly 12,000 architects in Australia today.</p>
<p>This gap is the target of a new scholarship fund to support Indigenous architecture students like Marni Reti, now in her fourth year of architecture at UTS and the only Indigenous student in her class.</p>
<p>The Droga Indigenous Architecture Scholarship has been made possible with a $1 million donation from cultural philanthropists the Droga Family Foundation. With additional support from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the aim is to eventually support up to 10 Indigenous students a year in their studies with UTS?s <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-design-architecture-and-building/what-we-do/architecture">School of Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>The scholarship follows on from the Droga <a href="http://foundation.architecture.com.au/">Architect in Residence</a> program Daniel and Lyndell Droga launched in 2014 in partnership with the Australian Institute of Architecture, which has the aim of providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism and design.</p>
<p>?We wanted to build on the success of the residency and, in particular, understand Indigenous participation in architecture in Australia ? and these hard facts [on Indigenous representation] were revealed in our research,? says Daniel Droga.</p>
<p>?It?s clear there?s enormous scope for improvement,? Lyndell Droga says. ?We decided to team up with UTS, working in collaboration with their Jumbunna [Indigenous Education and Research] program to develop a comprehensive scholarship that supports students not only with tuition and accommodation expenses but with meaningful career development opportunities such as mentoring and internships.?</p>

<p>?We workshopped the concept with my brother David and his wife, Marisa, who were eager to become involved,? says Daniel Droga.</p>
<p>?Through David?s business, <a href="https://droga5.com/">Droga5</a>, they have worked on numerous social interest campaigns, such as the Tap Project, UN World Humanitarian Day and the New York City Board of Education?s Million project.? [Droga5 is a New York-based, independent advertising network.]  </p>
<p>?We?re all thrilled to be involved in working towards meaningful change for Indigenous participation in Australian architecture,? Daniel Droga says.</p>
<p>The Drogas? donation is the largest single donation to the education of Indigenous architects in Australia.</p>
<p>The goal is to support up to six undergraduate and up to four postgraduate architecture scholarships each year. The awardees will also be mentored by the industry, with the Government Architect NSW and the NSW Architects Registration Board supporting the initiative as the first industry partners,</p>
<p>Professor Michael McDaniel, UTS?s Pro Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Leadership and Engagement, and Director of the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, says Indigenous architects have the potential to make a valuable contribution ?not only to their communities but to society as a whole, by bringing architectural skills and knowledge together with an understanding of culture, community and environment?.</p>
<p>UTS will support the Droga scholarships through Jumbunna, which includes the Galuwa Experience program introducing Indigenous high school students to a broad range of higher education opportunities, such as architecture.</p>
<p>UTS Professor of Architecture Anthony Burke says the perspective and knowledge of Indigenous architects is needed not just in Indigenous or remote communities but in urban spaces too.</p>
<p>?There?s an enormous, untapped wealth of Indigenous knowledge that has never made it across the threshold into architectural practice or environmental design,? he says. ?An Indigenous perspective on architecture is a real source of inspiration and a resource for us as a discipline.?</p>
<p>He hopes that by starting to build Indigenous representation in Australian architecture, yet more Indigenous people will be inspired to join the profession.</p>
<p>Student Marni Reti, who grew up on ?The Block? in Sydney?s Redfern, hopes to use her skills in her local community ? an urban environment where she wants to bring an Indigenous perspective and give local communities a voice.</p>
<p>Indigenous architects have a wealth of knowledge about country and land, and how to create a space that is specific to Australia, she says.</p>
<p>The Droga program aims to award the first two scholarships to commence in 2019.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">A team of young science students has won an industry education grant to develop a novel campaign against potentially deadly meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>The UTS Faculty of Science undergraduates have designed an emotional awareness promotion aimed at their peers, an age group at risk from a disease that has seen a significant spike in infections over the past three years.</p>
<p>Artworks created by meningococcal survivors to elicit a deep emotional response from young people will be showcased at an interactive arts festival called VAX &amp; ATE.  Survivors of meningococcal disease will be present to talk and connect with students.</p>
<p>Team member, and final year Medical Science student, Keisha Prasad says that before her involvement in the campaign she and her fellow team members had no personal connection to the disease nor really understood the potential impacts.</p>
<p>?As we got more involved we connected with a former UTS student who'd contracted an invasive form of the disease and lost all his limbs. We didn?t think these things happened.</p>
<p>?Now we have a personal connection [to meningococcal disease] and we hope our campaign will make it personal for other UTS students as well,? she says.</p>
<p>The grant is the result of an innovative partnership between UTS Science and Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccinations arm of global healthcare giant Sanofi.</p>
<p>Students studying human pathophysiology in the UTS school of life sciences attended a series of workshops led by Sanofi Pasteur experts, forming teams to devise ways to educate their peers about meningococcal disease.</p>
<p>?All too often in Australia we take [the battle against] infectious diseases for granted,? says Dr Hui Chen, the medical doctor and UTS academic who developed the human pathophysiology course.</p>
<p>?This is hardly surprising as our health care system is among the best in the world, and rates of infectious diseases are low.</p>
<p>?However, this sometimes leads to complacency, especially among young adults who perceive risk differently to older people.?</p>
<p>Dr Chen worked with infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Brian Oliver to help the students create their innovative campaigns. The top five teams pitched their ideas to Sanofi Pasteur senior executives, with the winning team receiving a $5,000 educational grant to implement their idea.</p>
<p>?The students have a wide knowledge of the clinical aspects of different human diseases,? says Dr Chen. ?This collaboration allowed them to solve a real-life problem in the classroom.?</p>
<p> Mr Russell Jacobsen, General Manager ANZ Sanofi Pasteur said that this pilot project brought together academia and industry to work together.</p>
<p> ?This collaboration has allowed industry and the university to work together in an innovative and creative way to respond to a current public health issue in Australia,? he said.</p>
<p>WHAT IS MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE?</p>
<p>? Meningococcal disease is rare among high school and university students but its onset is rapid and it can be fatal</p>
<p>? Typical symptoms include a rash, vomiting, fever, headache and/or stiff neck, drowsiness, sensitivity to bright light, joint pain</p>
<p>? Vaccines are available in Australia for each of the most common strains of the disease ? A, B, C, W and Y</p>
<p>? A new vaccine that targets strains A, C, W and Y is part of the national immunisation program for very young children, in response to a surge in notifications</p>
<p>? NSW Health is funding the MenACWY vaccine for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years while the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers listing it for all Australian adolescents</p>
<p>? Hygiene precautions such as hand-washing and cough etiquette will minimise the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The winning team of Yeshi Tsomo, Mohammad Al-Qazwini, Keisha Prasad, Harris Jabbour and Wayne But will unveil their campaign at the Vax &amp; Ate interactive arts festival on UTS Alumni Green, Tuesday 27 March, 11am-4pm.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">As Manager of the UTS Peer Assisted Study Success (U:PASS) program, Georgina Barratt-See wanted to know if it was really making a difference to student success. With 10 years of data to analyse she didn?t know where to begin. That?s where postgraduate student Len Tay and the Master of Data Science and Innovation?s subject iLab came in ? upskilling staff in data literacy while empowering students to work with real clients.</p>
<p><strong>Georgina Barratt-See</strong></p>
<p>We have 110 high-achieving and compassionate leaders running study sessions with students, mainly in first-year subjects. We know peer-based work is much more effective as the students see the peer leaders as just another student.</p>
<p>When I heard the Master of Data Science and Innovation had a subject giving master?s students projects to look at real industry data, I instantly wanted to know more. I've been doing my job for a very long time now ? almost 10 years ? and we compile a lot of individual data sets each session and perform a lot of evaluation. We look at how often students come to classes, the types of students that attend, their opinion of U:PASS, that kind of thing. But, there was no linkage of that data.</p>
<p>I don?t have the ability or time to look at our data in-depth and I always thought it would make a good research project. This was a great chance to look at the big picture results, like how the different subjects are performing and which ones we could work on. I put together a proposal and next thing I knew I had an email from Len telling me she had selected my project.</p>
<p>We instantly connected. Working with a student can be hard because you spend so much time teaching them what needs to be done. But Len just ?got it?, instantly. I immediately saw how intelligent she is.</p>
<p>If you meet Len she's just so calm and thoughtful. I'm kind of extroverted and passionate, so this pairing between us just worked.</p>
<p>I gave Len so much data and thought, 'She's not going to cope with this?. But she was able to unpick all the questions we were asking from a data perspective. As the project progressed, she clarified, probed and asked good questions.</p>
<p>We?re already seeing the benefits of this data project. I was approached by an associate dean asking for data from their particular faculty. I pulled out some of Len's data and explained what we'd discovered over the semesters and how we could see the different patterns across the subjects. It was great. </p>
<p>Working with Len was really rewarding and easy. I hope to stay in touch with Len and I like to think I?ve helped her in her new data scientist career.</p>
<p><strong>Len Tay</strong></p>
<p>I?ve been working in computer science for close to 20 years and have seen a lot of things we?re doing in the field already being outsourced. That?s why I decided to go back to university and study the Master of Data Science and Innovation. It?s a degree for students who?d like to become experts in data science.</p>
<p>I was attracted to the degree because it pointed to the future ? I wanted to move into something that I can see being ?alive? in years to come. Plus, I really like writing algorithms. I like doing programming. I like analysing data.</p>
<p>I met Georgina through iLab 1 ? it?s a subject that requires students to team-up with real clients to analyse their data. Out of a list of possible projects, both at UTS and in industry, I chose Georgina?s U:PASS project because I wanted to do something in student analysis. I?m a student myself, and my two kids study at UTS. I was curious to see what sort of experience students are having on campus. And the U:PASS data could tell me that.</p>
<p>I knew from the start that we?d work really well together. Georgina is a very open and helpful person and was flexible with how we worked. That?s a big thing. I?ve met other clients who are very demanding but Georgina wasn?t. She was very respectful of my time.</p>
<p>Georgina?s more of a morning person and I prefer to work at night, so we?d just email back and forth. I?d say I spent a total of 50 or 60 hours mining the data over about three months.</p>
<p>Georgina was also very clear on her objectives. Some clients just give you the data and ask you to find correlations and patterns, but Georgina is smart and knew what she wanted to ask of it: which are the best performing subjects? Which are the worst performing subjects? If a student stops attending U:PASS will they still continue to improve or not? Essentially, what?s the mark, if any, that U:PASS leaves on the student?s learning.</p>
<p>Before the project, I wasn?t sure if I could do data science confidently on my own. But working through it gave me enough confidence to say, ?Yep, I know what I?m doing?.</p>
<p>I think Georgina was surprised with what data can do. Or better, what we can do with data. When we started she was wary of handing over hundreds of thousands of records; like it was too much for me. But, I smiled and said, ?Don?t worry, the programming language can handle it?. Plus, data analysis gives me a kick! To be able to answer the questions people have, that gives me so much satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>So, what did the data tell us?</strong></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">The study of blood doesn?t tend to conjure up images of classroom banter, bingo calls or The Biebs. Until Associate Lecturer Rebecca Keppel and her team of scientists decided to change all that. Together they?ve reimagined the way their students learn about haematology at UTS, designing a series of games and authentic assessments that help students learn what they need in a way that?s interesting to them.</p>
<p>With a warm impish smile and a laugh that makes her shoulders bob, it?s easy to see that Rebecca Keppel?s a bit of fun. And as she talks through the activities she?s introduced to her classes ? like ?bone marrow bingo? and ?diagnose a celebrity? ? you can?t help but get caught up in her enthusiasm. Which is funny, says Rebecca, because ?I never thought I?d be a teacher. My mum was a teacher and I was set on a career in microbiology.?</p>
<p>Today, the Associate Lecturer in the School of Life Sciences (and a UTS biomedical science graduate) splits her time between both roles, teaching at the university and working at Liverpool Hospital.</p>
<p>Officially, says Rebecca, her title is Hospital Scientist. ?I spend my day at the microscope looking at over 100 blood films and making diagnoses on these patients.</p>
<p>?A lot of us teaching Haematology 1 and 2 work part-time in the industry, meaning we still work in labs day-to-day. What we wanted was for our students to actually learn what we were doing in the lab outside of university, so they can build the skills required in the workplace.</p>
<p>?Most importantly though, we wanted to make these experiences fun! We wanted to create hands-on activities that would engage our students.?</p>
<p>So, what did they do?</p>
<p>Well, says Rebecca, ?We developed a project to design activities that would change the way our students learned. We termed it ?small things that make a big difference?. One example was the ?case study project?.</p>
<p>?In the case study project, groups of students are assigned a set of case studies, progressing from basic to advanced. At each stage, the groups are assigned a celebrity exhibiting symptoms of varying degrees ? we?ve Miley Cyrus, Bieber, you know the usual tabloid headliners.</p>
<p>?The students must look at the symptoms their celebrity is presenting and then proceed to order tests for the patient so as to find out what?s wrong with them.?</p>
<p>To help the students, Rebecca and her team (Susan Green, Toni Flanagan, Karieshma Kabani, Daniel Mediati, Samira Aili, Reece Ajaka, Hiba Bahidh and Tamara Carrodus) designed a PowerPoint slide deck with embedded macros.</p>
<p>As students work through the slide deck, they are prompted to ask, ?which test do I order next??. Choosing from four possible tests at each stage of the diagnosis, the macros work in the background to calculate the total costs of their selected tests, and for each test the group selects, presents the relevant results.</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?What we wanted was for our students to actually learn what we were doing in the lab outside of university, so they can build the skills required in the workplace.?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hopefully, says Rebecca, at the end of the simulation the groups have enough information to make their diagnosis for their celebrity, all while keeping to their assigned budget.</p>
<p>?The activity focuses on the skills students need in the workplace ? students need to interrogate a range of symptoms, to be realistic about the total test expenditure, to be able to interpret certain results, and importantly make a progressive link to a diagnosis,? she explains.</p>
<p>?In some cases, someone might try to order a bone marrow biopsy for a patient that has come in with a fever. In a real situation, that?s not a logical step. By assigning them real people, albeit famous celebrities, with ?real? symptoms, we hope the students will get a sense of what it?s like to order tests for a patient.</p>
<p>?It?s about teaching them to make sense of what they are seeing results-wise and the next steps to take. It?s all a process and they need to learn that process.?</p>
<p>It?s just the same when looking at cell changes under a microscope. That?s where ?bone marrow bingo? comes in.</p>
<p>?We introduced ?bone marrow bingo?,? says Rebecca, ?because looking at a bone marrow slide is just hideous. As a scientist, I don?t even do it in the industry!?</p>
<p>Previously, tutors would dedicate an entire three-hour practical class to students examining bone marrow slides under a microscope. ?To give you an idea that?s asking them to identity a single cell in 10 billion,? Rebecca says.</p>
<p>?The students were just overwhelmed by this and didn?t have any idea what they were meant to be looking at. And we, the facilitators, would need to get around to 40 students one-by-one to try to show them the cells they needed to know. It was boring for our students and many felt like they weren?t making any progress.</p>
<p>?I would say to the students, ?look, at the end of the class, all I need is if I give you a picture of the cell you know what cell it is?. So, I thought, well why don?t I just do that.?</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>?So, we developed an activity where one-by-one we would flash up the 16 cells the students needed to be able to recognise. Like bingo, when they recognised it, they marked their bingo card. And, like bingo, the first to recognise all tests would get a prize.?</p>
<p>Students agree the change has been positive. ?I studied haematology in block-mode over Summer. There?s a lot to learn in two weeks; some days we could have up to six hours of class,? explains Bachelor of Medical Science student Luke Milham.</p>
<p>?The games were a fun way to break up the day and helped us see where we sat in comparison to the rest of the class,? he adds. ?For our last game before the test, Rebecca had read through all the cells and no one had yelled ?bingo?. She eventually figured out that the megakaryocyte card had been skipped. When she found the cell card and flashed it up ? 35 out of 40 of us yelled ?bingo?.?</p>
<p>It was this work, and more, that saw Rebecca and her team take out the Team Teaching Award in the 2017 UTS Learning and Teaching Awards.</p>
<p>And, while the recognition is nice, Rebecca?s motivation is much simpler: ?I just like getting students to have as much love for science as I do. Getting them to the moment where they understand something they once couldn?t, that?s just really rewarding.?</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">The study of blood doesn?t tend to conjure up images of classroom banter, bingo calls or The Biebs. Until Associate Lecturer Rebecca Keppel and her team of scientists decided to change all that. Together they?ve reimagined the way their students learn about haematology at UTS, designing a series of games and authentic assessments that help students learn what they need in a way that?s interesting to them.</p>
<p>With a warm impish smile and a laugh that makes her shoulders bob, it?s easy to see that Rebecca Keppel?s a bit of fun. And as she talks through the activities she?s introduced to her classes ? like ?bone marrow bingo? and ?diagnose a celebrity? ? you can?t help but get caught up in her enthusiasm. Which is funny, says Rebecca, because ?I never thought I?d be a teacher. My mum was a teacher and I was set on a career in microbiology.?</p>
<p>Today, the Associate Lecturer in the School of Life Sciences (and a UTS biomedical science graduate) splits her time between both roles, teaching at the university and working at Liverpool Hospital.</p>
<p>Officially, says Rebecca, her title is Hospital Scientist. ?I spend my day at the microscope looking at over 100 blood films and making diagnoses on these patients.</p>
<p>?A lot of us teaching Haematology 1 and 2 work part-time in the industry, meaning we still work in labs day-to-day. What we wanted was for our students to actually learn what we were doing in the lab outside of university, so they can build the skills required in the workplace.</p>
<p>?Most importantly though, we wanted to make these experiences fun! We wanted to create hands-on activities that would engage our students.?</p>
<p>So, what did they do?</p>
<p>Well, says Rebecca, ?We developed a project to design activities that would change the way our students learned. We termed it ?small things that make a big difference?. One example was the ?case study project?.</p>
<p>?In the case study project, groups of students are assigned a set of case studies, progressing from basic to advanced. At each stage, the groups are assigned a celebrity exhibiting symptoms of varying degrees ? we?ve Miley Cyrus, Bieber, you know the usual tabloid headliners.</p>
<p>?The students must look at the symptoms their celebrity is presenting and then proceed to order tests for the patient so as to find out what?s wrong with them.?</p>
<p>To help the students, Rebecca and her team (Susan Green, Toni Flanagan, Karieshma Kabani, Daniel Mediati, Samira Aili, Reece Ajaka, Hiba Bahidh and Tamara Carrodus) designed a PowerPoint slide deck with embedded macros.</p>
<p>As students work through the slide deck, they are prompted to ask, ?which test do I order next??. Choosing from four possible tests at each stage of the diagnosis, the macros work in the background to calculate the total costs of their selected tests, and for each test the group selects, presents the relevant results.</p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>?What we wanted was for our students to actually learn what we were doing in the lab outside of university, so they can build the skills required in the workplace.?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hopefully, says Rebecca, at the end of the simulation the groups have enough information to make their diagnosis for their celebrity, all while keeping to their assigned budget.</p>
<p>?The activity focuses on the skills students need in the workplace ? students need to interrogate a range of symptoms, to be realistic about the total test expenditure, to be able to interpret certain results, and importantly make a progressive link to a diagnosis,? she explains.</p>
<p>?In some cases, someone might try to order a bone marrow biopsy for a patient that has come in with a fever. In a real situation, that?s not a logical step. By assigning them real people, albeit famous celebrities, with ?real? symptoms, we hope the students will get a sense of what it?s like to order tests for a patient.</p>
<p>?It?s about teaching them to make sense of what they are seeing results-wise and the next steps to take. It?s all a process and they need to learn that process.?</p>
<p>It?s just the same when looking at cell changes under a microscope. That?s where ?bone marrow bingo? comes in.</p>
<p>?We introduced ?bone marrow bingo?,? says Rebecca, ?because looking at a bone marrow slide is just hideous. As a scientist, I don?t even do it in the industry!?</p>
<p>Previously, tutors would dedicate an entire three-hour practical class to students examining bone marrow slides under a microscope. ?To give you an idea that?s asking them to identity a single cell in 10 billion,? Rebecca says.</p>
<p>?The students were just overwhelmed by this and didn?t have any idea what they were meant to be looking at. And we, the facilitators, would need to get around to 40 students one-by-one to try to show them the cells they needed to know. It was boring for our students and many felt like they weren?t making any progress.</p>
<p>?I would say to the students, ?look, at the end of the class, all I need is if I give you a picture of the cell you know what cell it is?. So, I thought, well why don?t I just do that.?</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>?So, we developed an activity where one-by-one we would flash up the 16 cells the students needed to be able to recognise. Like bingo, when they recognised it, they marked their bingo card. And, like bingo, the first to recognise all tests would get a prize.?</p>
<p>Students agree the change has been positive. ?I studied haematology in block-mode over Summer. There?s a lot to learn in two weeks; some days we could have up to six hours of class,? explains Bachelor of Medical Science student Luke Milham.</p>
<p>?The games were a fun way to break up the day and helped us see where we sat in comparison to the rest of the class,? he adds. ?For our last game before the test, Rebecca had read through all the cells and no one had yelled ?bingo?. She eventually figured out that the megakaryocyte card had been skipped. When she found the cell card and flashed it up ? 35 out of 40 of us yelled ?bingo?.?</p>
<p>It was this work, and more, that saw Rebecca and her team take out the Team Teaching Award in the 2017 UTS Learning and Teaching Awards.</p>
<p>And, while the recognition is nice, Rebecca?s motivation is much simpler: ?I just like getting students to have as much love for science as I do. Getting them to the moment where they understand something they once couldn?t, that?s just really rewarding.?</p>

<p>Family reunification was their overwhelming desire, with students Chloe*, Jenna* and Ann* expressing deep sadness and loss on being separated from their grandparents for many years, following their escape from North Korea as children or teenagers.</p>
<p>These students are part of the second fully funded Former North Korean Students Scholarship program. The program allowed five university students (now South Korean citizens) the opportunity to complete 30 weeks of English language education at UTS Insearch in Sydney.</p>
<p>?The Sydney-based Korean community and the University of Technology Sydney are extremely supportive of international students coming to study at UTS Insearch.  These students have been warmly welcomed and really enjoyed their time in Sydney,? said Dr Bronwen Dalton, Director, Not-For-Profit and Social Enterprise Program, UTS Business School.</p>
<p>Chloe* has loved her education, as well as learning to swim and visiting the beach. ?I?ve met good people and had a good education. In addition I have had various experiences outside of UTS Insearch ? The New Year?s Eve fireworks were very beautiful, but the people I met made it memorable. I was with a group of seven people ? two Americans, two Indians, one Chinese and one Colombian ? and although we have different cultures and languages we can be friends; I realised again the importance of English,? she said.</p>

<p><strong>About the scholarships</strong></p>
<p>UTS Insearch created the <a href="https://www.insearch.edu.au/how-to-apply/scholarships/former-north-korean-students">scholarship program</a> with support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?s Australia-Korea Foundation, and the South Korean Ministry of Unification (through the Hana Foundation). The scholarships assist student defectors, formerly from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), who are now South Korean citizens.</p>
<p>The program covers the cost of 30 weeks of English language tuition, return flights from South Korea to Sydney, accommodation and living expenses in Sydney, with the total scholarship program valued at around $200,000 a year.</p>
<p>The third round of applications for scholarship will be launched in the next two months, and it is anticipated the next cohort of scholarship students will arrive in Sydney in July 2018.</p>

<p>Over the course of two years, Dr Hunter?s research found that primary school teachers? capacity and confidence in teaching STEM subjects increases when they use inquiry processes to create integrated term-long units of work.</p>

<p>?Learning all of the prescribed syllabus topics covered in STEM is formidable for teachers,? says Dr Hunter. ?But giving them a framework supports them to develop their subject matter knowledge as well as their students? soft skills ? things like problem solving, critical thinking and collaboration.</p>

But, rather than being a code word for unemployment, these days being ? or becoming ? an entrepreneur is a far more standardised, formalised and demystified process, and one they can pursue through study.</p>
<p>Your child won't be in your garage, because there are co-working spaces. Better still, they can be fed and watered (for free) at the many beer and pizza start-up 'pitch' nights, where they practise selling an idea to investors.</p>
<p>They'll pick up skills and network at the many 'hackathons', which are often sponsored by government departments and corporations. And many universities now offer subjects and programs where they can work on their start-up idea with institutional support, both educational and financial. </p>
<p>We have moved well away from the mistaken idea that entrepreneurs are born, not made. The research tells us that young people can acquire an entrepreneurial mindset and the practices that go with it. For your child, that's a skill set they'll need not just to pursue their own business ideas for but for employment in the workplace of the future.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know to know if your school leaver wants to be an entrepreneur:</p>
<p><strong>Are all start-ups started in a garage? What if I don't have a garage? </strong></p>
<p>If you don't have a garage, don't panic. There are now co-working spaces (picture beanbags, ping pong tables and desks) where your child can work to develop their idea. They can hang out and work on their project in these places from $38 a day or $300 a month.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: these spaces are more than a desk (or a ping pong table). They're a community of support where people can connect with other entrepreneurs, and with designers, analysts and investors ? even their future CTO or CXO (chief technical officer or chief experience officer).</p>
<p><strong>Is anyone ever going to buy that idea?</strong></p>
<p>You may not be able to understand what it is that your child is working on, and you may wonder whether anyone else can either. Good news: part of the 'start-up way' is testing your ideas quickly and cheaply with real customers so that's OK.</p>
<p>Google search 'lean start-up' and get used to talking about their minimum viable product (or MVP).</p>
<p>Even better, they can freely engage in pitching events and competitions where they'll get immediate feedback. Co-working spaces run such events, and they often come with pizza ? as well as investors on the lookout for the next big thing.</p>
<p>Government agencies and companies are also getting in on the act by sponsoring hackathons ?  usually one- or two-day events that bring together a range of people with entrepreneurial mindsets to tackle problems (often 'wicked' or particularly difficult ones).</p>
<p>Have a look at the great work of <a href="https://techfugees.com/">TechFugees</a>, being run in capital cities around Australia. Hackathons are a great way to connect to the innovation 'ecosystem', learn the lean start-up process ? and get your kids out of the house for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>You want money for what?!</strong></p>
<p>We know from research that most of the early-stage money for start-ups comes from ? wait for it ? friends and family and, yes, their personal resources. This reliance on minimal capital, let alone debt, is known as 'boot strapping'. (You're probably old enough to remember the term 'to pull yourself up by your shoelaces', or bootstraps.)</p>
<p>But with many universities like UTS now offering entrepreneurship subjects and accelerator programs, students often get to work on their idea as part of their course. Better yet, they'll meet others who may become 'founders' too, potentially even chipping in funds.</p>
<p>Being part of a larger institution brings other benefits too. There are competitions and accelerator program (8-12 week boot camps), which are often free to join, with winners securing what can be serious prize money and in-kind support (such as a free spot in a co-working space).</p>
<p><strong>Will my child ever be a unicorn?</strong></p>
<p>Research has moved us well beyond the idea that entrepreneurs are born not made (remember when Donald Trump was held up as an entrepreneurial success story?).</p>
<p>Recently published in the prestigious <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/357/6357/1287.full.pdf">Science Magazine</a>, a World Bank study using randomised control trials found that psychological training on developing a 'personal initiative' mindset (a self-starting, future-oriented and persistent proactive mindset) significantly improved business success.  </p>
<p>This entrepreneurial mindset involves looking for ways to anticipate problems, better overcome setbacks and fosters better planning for opportunities and long-term preparation (sound a bit like what you tried to instill in them at home?).</p>
<p>So if your child's start-up doesn't become a unicorn ? a start-up that hits $1 billion value ? that sort of mindset means they'll be valued by any organisation and needed in tackling some of the complex problems facing society today. We all need to develop a courageous generation asking "surely we can do better?" and then making it happen.</p>

<p>The symposium sought to begin a community and cross-sector conversation about the role of the 21<sup>st</sup> century university and played host to diverse speakers and leaders across universities, trade unions, businesses, industry, not-for-profit and non-governmental organisations, and community groups.</p>
<p>Notable speakers included the two key notes, Marc Stears (formerly New Economics Foundation UK) and Professor Raewyn Connell (University of Sydney), as well as the Hon Verity Firth (Executive Director, Social Justice at UTS), Dr Cassandra Goldie (Chief Executive Officer, ACOSS), Tim Dodd (Higher Education Editor, <em>The Australian</em>) and Patricia Forsythe (Sydney Business Chamber). Other key UTS speakers included Professor James Goodman, Dr Tamson Pietsch, Professor Larissa Behrendt and UTS Students? Association President Lachlan Barker.</p>
<p>The all-day event saw panel and audience members discussing a broad range of topics including the public benefit of universities, their social and research impact, issue of declining public trust and political agendas relating to the higher education sector.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the higher education sector, Professor Brungs is optimistic, arguing that universities are places of absolute hope and opportunity.</p>
<p>?It is pivotal that universities consider how, in today?s world, they drive their contribution to public benefit. And to consider how to broaden the direct engagement with, and listen to the community, to increase effectiveness of the role of universities as advocates and thought leaders on issues that directly concern and impact communities.?</p>
<p>Moving forward Professor Brungs sees the issues surrounding universities as being dealt with in three ways: rethinking the traditional pathways through which universities engage with the public, increasing the scale and depth of their engagement, and finally deepening relationships with communities that surround universities.</p>
<p>These ideas are at the heart of UTS?s newly developed <a href="https://socialimpact.uts.edu.au/">Social Impact Framework</a>. Through an articulation of a broader vision for the role of universities, the framework sets to guide UTS?s future contribution to this space.</p>
<p>Leading these efforts is UTS?s Executive Director, Social Justice, Verity Firth. ?It?s important for universities to remember their core mission,? says Firth. ?It is up to individuals and institutions to lead processes that encourage the building of shared agendas for change. Universities are uniquely placed to help drive collaborations; we have the resources and the people and we should embrace our public purpose role.?</p>
