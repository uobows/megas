That suggests he was out most or all of the fourth quarter.  And if you remember, when they switched from Ulizio to JBB back in October is exactly when our running game starting clicking.  It&#39;s not crazy to think our running game might have been noticeably weaker in the fourth quarter for that reason.  Hope to figure out more when the UFR comes out.<br /><br />It&#39;s weird how the expectations game goes.  Given the expectations going into the game, I&#39;ve got to think that almost every Michigan fan would have been overjoyed to hear that with two minutes and change left in the game Michigan had the ball with a chance to drive and take the lead back with a touchdown.  Then we somehow conjured up one of the best quarters against the Buckeyes that any team has had in the 2010s, and somehow losing the game is suddenly traumatic rather than expected.<br /><br />And on the flip side are the people who just seem to think a loss is a loss, and don&#39;t notice that we have played really well against OSU the last two years.  I don&#39;t see any obvious reason to expect OSU to get worse, but there is every reason in the world to think UM is going to keep getting better than next couple of years.  I cannot WAIT to find out what happens next.";s:9:"link_edit";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/7379236110661181442/comments/default/3985144982828237470";s:9:"link_self";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/7379236110661181442/comments/default/3985144982828237470";s:4:"link";s:115:"http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2017/11/every-breaking-wave.html?showComment=1511742901001#c3985144982828237470";s:11:"author_name";s:2:"SF";s:10:"author_uri";s:52:"https://www.blogger.com/profile/02815984722071185197";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:5;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-35971090.post-5756675994232362271";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-11-18T19:20:07.524-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-11-18T19:20:07.524-05:00";s:5:"title";s:53:"&quot;Like so many things when you get older, you ...";s:12:"atom_content";s:269:"&quot;Like so many things when you get older, you find yourself less and less sure of the reasons why things happen, something that a younger you would be befuddled by because you expected the world to make more sense as you got older, not less.&quot;<br /><br />Truth.";s:9:"link_edit";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/8929946496570463847/comments/default/5756675994232362271";s:9:"link_self";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/8929946496570463847/comments/default/5756675994232362271";s:4:"link";s:128:"http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2017/11/some-days-are-better-than-others.html?showComment=1511050807524#c5756675994232362271";s:11:"author_name";s:2:"SF";s:10:"author_uri";s:52:"https://www.blogger.com/profile/02815984722071185197";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:6;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-35971090.post-8240625397497753389";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-10-04T17:47:30.946-04:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-10-04T17:47:30.946-04:00";s:5:"title";s:53:"DANG!

I&#39;ll try my best to be brief, in anticipation of reading the book (I&#39;ve seen only the excerpts).<br /><br />1.  Rightfully, Bacon has championed the student-athletes themselves.  They are mostly superior kids, very hard working, and ordinarily really great students.  I expect more of the same.<br /><br />2.  Michigan&#39;s student-fans at football games shouldn&#39;t get off so easy.  For some weird reason, Bobby Dishell comes off as a hero for protesting the general admission seating policy.  He&#39;s right about that; it was a bad policy.  But remember the reason for general admission.  It was because the students were so crappy about showing up on time for games, if at all.  Ticket prices had nothing to do with that.  Students who had already paid for tickets were so casual about them, they just didn&#39;t care.  Brandon tried to address that.  And THAT is on the students, not Brandon.<br /><br />3.  It&#39;s pretty freaking ironic, for students to gripe about high ticket prices at the same time they are clamoring for a shiny new $6 million Harbaugh.  With the current schedule, a Michigan student can take $185 of their Pell grant money and sell of the MSU and OSU tickets for $250 each.  And then write a paper about profits.<br /><br />4.  Dave Brandon -- almost alone in the Michigan administration -- was the guy who stood up to the Free Press in the wake of Stretchgate and the NCAA case.  (In which Michigan got pretty much nothing of a penalty for having done pretty much nothing wrong.)  Remember &quot;Dave Brandon&#39;s pimp hand&quot;?  No?  They can&#39;t seem to remember it at MGoBlog, either.  Where they invented it.<br /><br />5.  There are some pretty extreme partisan politics at work on the University of Michigan Board of Regents, and I&#39;ll be interested if Bacon was able to tell it all.  Exhibit A was the fireworks debacle in the summer of 2014.  Brandon&#39;s athletic department had a reasonable request; fireworks for the Penn State night game, and also in connection with the Miami University game band show, which featured the band doing the 1812 Overture on military appreciation day.  The Regents turned Brandon down, in a public meeting which should have been pro forma, and in the most humiliating way they could concoct.  With Regent Larry Deitch claiming that any fireworks in Michigan Stadium might be crazy-stupid dangerous.  Deitch must have forgotten that THEY HAD A FIREWORKS SHOW AT THE BIG CHILL HOCKEY GAME in that same Michigan Stadium.<br /><br />6.  I am laughing my effing ass off at the students and alums of our rivals, who sneer at Dave Brandon&#39;s alleged commercialism.  A bottle of water in Ohio Stadium is the same price as Michigan Stadium.  Their seat licenses are effectively more (under a different formula) than Michigan&#39;s.

If you recall, the only 1 of the 4 (Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State, and MSU) that was talking about being in the WEST division was MSU - despite it making no geographic sense.  (which is so MSU by the way)<br /><br />This problem could have been easily alleviated THIS YEAR by switching the Indiana game to a road game.  It was as simple as that.  It went ignored - that smells of this being negotiated and purposefully done.<br /><br />Michigan State had just played a Big Ten season without a single regular season game against Ohio State, Penn State, or Wisconsin.  That was also the third time in the last 5 years they hadn&#39;t played Ohio State.  Why in the world wasn&#39;t that taken into consideration?  Why did they get favorable treatment once again?   <br /><br />The problem also could have been alleviated by making MSU play Nebraska at Nebraska two years in a row.   To soften the blow for making us play in EL two years in a row.  Yet that rotation wasn&#39;t altered.<br /><br />Michigan State got two home games in a row versus Michigan and Ohio State.  They got to keep their regular rotation with Nebraska.  <br /><br />I am sure the whining will begin on their side pretty soon on how they got screwed when they play Michigan, Ohio State, and Nebraska all on the road next year.  Once reality sets it, they will realize they screwed themselves over the long term for this short term back to back favorable schedules.   <br /><br />This problem can be fixed with us getting two home games in 2015 and 2016 and switching the Indiana game.   Also there better not be any BS talk about  making the second game a neutral site.  We had to go to their dump two years in a row and the Michigan freshman from 2011 saw ONE home game versus Michigan State.  Not to mention Hoke will have only coached ONE home game against them.   The idea of a neutral site was completely ignored for the 2014 - it would have been a fair trade off.<br /><br />Brandon was obviously too weak to stop this.  He was outwitted in negotiations just like the Notre Dame series cancellation.  <br /><br />I have no doubt this scheduling issue will be a topic next year talking how it screwed MSU over.  Sorry MSU, you screwed yourselves over.  You manipulated a favorable schedule in the short term to follow up your comically easy 2013 schedule.<br /><br />I hope the talks open up again with this once MSU takes another look at their schedule for next season.  It they want to fix it, they better be ready to play in Ann Arbor two years in a row.  I have no doubt that any initial negotiations will revolve around that second game being at a neutral site, all the while conveniently ignoring that a neutral site game was completely ignored in 2014.";s:9:"link_edit";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/5127599394926352634/comments/default/8309503143290013823";s:9:"link_self";s:94:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/5127599394926352634/comments/default/8309503143290013823";s:4:"link";s:108:"http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2014/11/fix-schedule.html?showComment=1415182083091#c8309503143290013823";s:11:"author_name";s:36:"6cd059b2-365e-11e4-9ade-a3fbc510d94a";s:10:"author_uri";s:66:"https://openid.aol.com/opaque/6cd059b2-365e-11e4-9ade-a3fbc510d94a";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:18;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-35971090.post-4621493344294451667";s:9:"published";s:29:"2014-11-04T17:31:38.180-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2014-11-04T17:31:38.180-05:00";s:5:"title";s:53:"So Craig what is the prevailing theory on how our ...";s:12:"atom_content";s:339:"So Craig what is the prevailing theory on how our natural rotation with MSU got screwed up in the first place?

Michigan would have two at home in even years (MSU/PSU) and one on at home in odd years (OSU) while MSU has Ohio State at home in even years and Michigan and Penn State at home in odd years.  OSU gets Michigan at home in even years and MSU/PSU at home in odd years, and PSU gets OSU/MSU at home in even years and Michigan in odd years.  So, as much as you can balance that quartet, I think you have.<br /><br />Feast/famine would work in future scenarios for Michigan.  2016 has Wisconsin and Illinois at home (in addition to Hawaii, UCF, and Colorado) (OK, so not great.)<br /><br />2018 has Arkansas, Nebraska, SMU, Penn State at home as well as a TBA game, so that&#39;s not too bad.<br /><br />2014 looked to be a dry spell to be &quot;got through&quot; and unfortunately, it didn&#39;t pan out.

The consequences have been devastating.  Among my circle of season ticket holders, several of them now FORMER season ticket holders, this became the year to give up on their family tradition of Michigan football because of the historic lack of any rival on the home schedule.  (I don&#39;t think any of them much cared about competitive balance or anything like that.)<br /><br />But you guys didn&#39;t address what I have (confusedly, I am quick to say) understood was the real reason for the B1G flip of our home rotation with MSU; supposedly, it was to mate some sort of balance with the quartet of PSU, MSU, OSU and Michigan all together.  Making sure that none of the four ever had to play all of the other three on the road in any one season.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t done the future-schedule calculation; but what happens when you figure the PSU schedule into your proposal?<br /><br />There is one other notion, which is too evil for me to accept; that together, Dave Brandon and Mark Hollis figured that if they both went to feast/famine scheduling, with both conference rivals at home every other year, they could use those feast years to ratchet up ticket prices.<br /><br />Now that is pure speculation on my part.  And as a moderately staunch defender of Dave Brandon against his MGoDetractors, I&#39;d like to see such speculation refuted.  But the flip of MSU on our home schedule was a massive fail that really cries out for a detailed explanation.";s:9:"link_edit";s:93:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/5127599394926352634/comments/default/995274531195651548";s:9:"link_self";s:93:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/35971090/5127599394926352634/comments/default/995274531195651548";s:4:"link";s:107:"http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2014/11/fix-schedule.html?showComment=1415131557376#c995274531195651548";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Chuck";s:10:"author_uri";s:52:"https://www.blogger.com/profile/07676108366725199186";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:21;a:11:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-35971090.post-4598862879013126319";s:9:"published";s:29:"2014-11-03T08:46:27.012-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2014-11-03T08:46:27.012-05:00";s:5:"title";s:53:"The one potential flaw, which could take a little ...";s:12:"atom_content";s:254:"The one potential flaw, which could take a little more juggling, is the fact that in 2016, Michigan would play four home games in a row, followed by three road games to close out the year under this system.
