  <p><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">An Australian Rules Football competition in Central Australia?s bush communities may hold the key to improved health and wellbeing outcomes among Aboriginal people, a Charles Darwin University researcher says.</span></p><p>Northern Institute Indigenous Social Researcher Professor Barry Judd put forward the idea to guests of philanthropist Susan Alberti at the Australian Club in Melbourne last week on the eve of the 2018 AFL season.</p><p>?I spoke about the wellbeing benefits of playing football in Indigenous communities such as Papunya, and of the need for an on-country football league with support from the AFL industry to operate out there in a way that it hasn?t to date,? Professor Judd said.</p><p>?I explained that these communities are relatively safe places for young men to play football. They are places where they know how to behave socially according to traditional law, and where elders are able to engage with younger men and put them on a right path in life through football.?</p><p>Professor Judd, a descendant of the Pitjantjatjara people and a leading scholar on Aboriginal participation in Australian sport, has spent several years observing the social impact of Australian Rules on Indigenous Australia and how participation in organised sport affects identity and everyday life in remote communities.</p><p>He said a number of social issues could be linked to football?s existing structure in Central Australia, which funnels many games into Alice Springs.</p><p>?Young men come to Alice Springs to play or watch football and don?t go home,? he said.</p><p>?This can lead to overcrowding in town camps, people running out of money for food, and law and order issues that contribute to the high number of Indigenous men who end up in jail.</p><p>?We could minimise risk by reducing the number of trips these young fellas make to Alice to play football in a way that is similar to how the game is structured in Top End communities and Arnhem Land.?</p><p>Professor Judd speculated that the ?bush league? might comprise six or eight teams from communities west and northwest of Alice Springs, which competed in a home and away format, followed by a short finals series.</p><p>?We have the expertise to study and analyse such a football competition and to track changes in wellbeing, but what?s needed is a supporter who?s prepared to invest in on-country football over a number of years,? he said.</p><p>?Football has a positive impact in the lives of young Aboriginal men by keeping them fit and on the right path, but it could do so much more if we took the time to restructure football in Central Australia.?</p><p>Professor Judd?s presentation in Melbourne was supported by the Bridging the Gap Foundation, which raises funds for research at Charles Darwin University and the Menzies School of Health Research.</p><!--

  <p>The harrowing stories of the only group of Timorese asylum seekers to reach Australia by boat during the Indonesian occupation will come to light through an Asia Study Grant from the National Library of Australia. <br /><br />Charles Darwin University lecturer in Indonesian Studies Dr Vannessa Hearman aims to produce a book about the voyage and Australia?s relationship with Indonesia, given the tensions over East Timor at that time.<br /><br />?My project looks into a group of 18 Timorese asylum seekers who sailed the fishing boat, the Good Sea (Tasi Diak), from Indonesian-occupied East Timor to Darwin in 1995,? Dr Hearman said.<br /><br />?This was the only boat during the entire history of Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975-99) to have reached Australia.? <br /><br />Dr Hearman said the arrival of the Tasi Diak and the Australian Government's reception of the asylum seekers threatened to jeopardise Australia?s cordial relationship with Indonesia.<br /><br />?When they arrived the group was sent to Western Australia, where they were detained for seven weeks before being given bridging visas, leading to eight years in limbo living in Darwin, Sydney and Melbourne,? she said.<br /><br />?Bridging visas did not allow the asylum seekers to work or study and had to be renewed every three months, so these people were very dependent on others within the community to try and start their new lives.?<br /><br />Born in Indonesia, Dr Hearman moved to Melbourne with her family in 1984 when she was 11 years old. She became actively involved in human rights issues after attending a demonstration in response to the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre in Dili in which more than 250 Timorese people were killed.<br /><br />It was through her concern for East Timor that she met her now partner Jose Da Costa, one of the asylum seekers who arrived on the Tasi Diak, and who has become a well-known actor and filmmaker.<br /><br />Now living in Darwin with Jose, Dr Hearman said she hoped to tell the stories of these asylum seekers, most of whom were fleeing persecution and torture, and how they dealt with their situations.<br /><br />?The library is a treasure trove of Australia's rich Asian collections,? she said. ?I also hope to talk to members of the crew of the Tasi Diak and politicians including former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans about the political tensions.?<br /><br />The Asia Study Grant scheme is for Asia researchers, who are citizens or residents of Australia, and who are conducting research on Asia. It supports their travel to the National Library of Australia to access the Asian collections. Dr Hearman will take up the grant in early July this year.<br /><br />The project is also supported by a Northern Territory History Grant.<br /><br /></p><!--

  <p>Visitors can ride a bike through the streets of Sydney or travel through the human bloodstream as part of an interactive exhibition opening this week at Charles Darwin University?s Art Gallery.<br /><br />The touring exhibition ?People Like Us?, from the University of New South Wales, captures universal aspects of the contemporary human condition in film, animation, digital and creative art.<br /><br />CDU Art Gallery Curator Kellie Joswig said the exhibition would showcase a diverse collection of new media works by Australian and international artists on the themes of mapping, medical and sound to highlight the human condition.<br /><br />?The exhibition also reveals the many experimental technologies being used by artists today as they comment on issues confronting us in the 21st Century,? Ms Joswig said.<br /><br />?One of the pieces is a stationary bike that visitors can physically ride, while watching their journey through the streets of Sydney on a big screen. They can even control the speed of their journey.?<br /><br />Other pieces include a set of ipads with a clip-on ear piece designed to assist with anxiety, a confronting medical procedure, an animated painting and sounds of animals designed to help visitors escape their surroundings and relax.<br /><br />Curated by Director of UNSW Galleries Dr Felicity Fenner, ?People Like Us? is underpinned by real human experience, a concept that extends to visitor engagement with many of the works on display by international artists including Venice Biennale entrant Yuri Ancarani, British composer Michael Nyman, and award-winning Luxembourg artist Su-Mei Tse.<br /><br />Well-known Australian artists represented in the exhibition include Daniel Crooks, Angelica Mesiti and Joan Ross, who all deploy innovative filmic methodologies to achieve unexpected and immersive visual experiences.<br /><br />The exhibition will run from 8 March ? 5 May at the CDU Art Gallery, building Orange 12, Casuarina campus. For more information and opening hours visit W: cdu.edu.au/artgallery. On Thursday, 8 March at 12pm the 2017 recipient of the Sulman Prize Joan Ross will give a floor talk on her piece titled ?The Claiming of Things?.<br /><br />It is a National Exhibitions Touring Support Australia exhibition developed by UNSW Galleries and toured by Museums &amp; Galleries of NSW. The National Touring Initiative is supported by the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its principal arts funding body, and by the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy, an initiative of the Australian, State and Territory Governments.</p><!--

  <p>A rapidly growing industry worth upwards of $40 million to Northern Australia is the focus of a forum in Darwin this week.<br /><br />The Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research (DCBR) at Charles Darwin University, with government and industry partners, will host the first national Savanna Fire and Carbon forum from 27 ? 28 February.<br /><br />Forum co-ordinator and bushfire researcher Cameron Yates said strategic burning regimes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were now widespread, providing huge environmental, social and economic benefits to communities and private landholders.<br /><br />?This fledgling industry now covers hundreds of thousands of square kilometres across North Australia and is generating millions of dollars a year in income,? Mr Yates said.<br /><br />He said the forum would bring together more than 100 key stakeholders from across Northern Australia including bushfire experts, Indigenous and non-Indigenous land managers, scientists and industry partners.<br /><br />?This meeting will be an important milestone in the development of this globally significant innovation in land management.?<br /><br />The forum will be the first of regular industry meetings bringing together stakeholders to discuss operational best-practice and develop the savanna fire and carbon industry.<br /><br />?Considering the fast-evolving policy and practice related to Northern fire management, this meeting will be key in building a stronger network and common goals between groups and individuals and provide a clearer articulation of industry needs into the future,? Mr Yates said.<br /><br />?It will also provide information on the support, training and tools available as well as vital updates on current legal, financial and scientifically proven methodology.? <br /><br />A number of the fire monitoring tools to be discussed have been developed jointly by researchers at DCBR with fire managers from across Northern Australia.<br /><br />DCBR senior research fellow Dr Peter Jacklyn said the North Australia and Rangelands Fire Information fire-monitoring website had been used effectively by fire managers involved in the Carbon Farming Initiative.<br /><br />?By measuring the areas burnt in different seasons and by knowing the type of vegetation burnt, fire managers can estimate the accountable greenhouse gas emissions of fires on their land,? Dr Jacklyn said. ?If fire managers have been effective in limiting the frequency of fires and emissions, these estimates can then be used to earn carbon credits.?<br /> <br />The CDU hosted event is being supported by the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Department of Environment and Energy, the Indigenous Land Corporation and Arnhem Land Fire Abatement.

  <p>A Charles Darwin University research team that examined the history of Indigenous higher education in the Northern Territory has proposed a set of three recommendations that should inform future policy.</p><p>Director of Operations ? Office of Indigenous Leadership Dr Wendy Ludwig was a major contributor to the ?NT Indigenous Higher Education Policy Review?, which examined the effectiveness of policies dating back more than 60 years.</p><p>?Essentially we wanted to identify which policies worked and which ones didn?t from Australia?s early policy approaches of assimilation and self-determination, through to today?s outcomes-oriented approaches,? Dr Ludwig said.</p><p>?This was in response to recognition of decades of research and program evaluations, and the persistent call from Indigenous advocates for the need to learn from history.?</p><p>Dr Ludwig said an exploration of Indigenous perspectives of ?success? was one of the key aspects of the research.</p><p>?We explored how these perspectives related to definitions of success within policy and how these evolved over time. Many of the quantifiable metrics common in policy represent only part of the story; there are other community-focused outcomes that are just as important. Clearly the disparity has served as a barrier to the development of genuine partnerships between governments and Indigenous groups and communities in higher education policy reform.?</p><p>Dr Ludwig said the recommendations were targeted at government and the tertiary sector. They are:</p><ul><li>that the Australian Government establishes and funds an independent National Indigenous Education Committee to consult and provide specialist advice to government on matters relating to Indigenous education at all levels</li><li>that the Northern Territory Government establishes and funds an independent NT Indigenous Education Consultative Group to provide specialist advice to the NT Minister for Education on all sectors of Indigenous education, and</li><li>that CDU and the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (BIITE) explore opportunities to collaborate more effectively, particularly in the field of research.</li></ul><p>?We would like to see a greater Indigenous voice in the development of a forward-thinking policy framework that can drive change, and which coordinates investment and research.?</p><p>Dr Ludwig said the review was carried out by CDU?s Office of the Pro Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Leadership in collaboration with BIITE. It is available online at <a href="http://cdu.edu.au/indigenous-leadership">W: cdu.edu.au/indigenous-leadership</a>  (see Key Documents).</p><!--

  <p>A group of Territory primary school students has attended university and feed a barra as part of a new program to encourage future participation in higher education.<br /><br />The students from Driver, Manunda Terrace and Ludmilla primary schools were the first to undertake a Children?s University activity this week at Charles Darwin University. <br /><br />The Children?s University coordinates a program of high-quality, voluntary learning opportunities for children aged seven to14, with a focus on rewarding participation, raising aspirations and encouraging a love of learning.  <br /><br />Program co-ordinator Julie Forrest-Davis said the establishment of the Northern Territory?s Children?s University opened up engaging learning opportunities for children. <br /><br />?The focus is very much on the children having a fun, while they are learning,? Ms Forrest-Davis said.<br /><br />?The children visited our Aquaculture Centre to meet the turtles and feed the barra, had a virtual reality experience and visited Crocodylus Park.?<br /><br />She said CDU was delighted to be delivering ?Children?s University Charles Darwin? in partnership with schools, parents and a range of organisations that provided exciting learning activities for children across Darwin and Palmerston.<br /><br />?Students will get a taste of university life throughout the year when they visit CDU and other organisations as part of the program,? she said.<br /><br />The Children?s University, owned globally by the Children?s University Trust, was established in the UK in the early 1990s. The Children?s University Australia was launched in 2013. The NT program will be run through CDU.<br /><br />?The program is designed to develop confidence in children outside school hours by accessing a variety of extra learning opportunities at local Learning Destination providers,? Ms Forrest-Davis said.<br /><br />?The children will earn credit stamps in their Passport to Learning. Once they reach certain thresholds they will attend a formal graduation ceremony hosted by CDU and attended by their families and Children?s University partners.?<br /><br />Learning Destination providers involved in the program include Parliament House, Bunnings Warehouse NT, City of Darwin Libraries, Palmerston Library, Crocodylus Park, The Royal Flying Doctors and Bombing of Darwin Experience, Darwin Languages Centre, Darwin Military Museum, Girl Guides NT and NT Art Storms.

  <p>A Charles Darwin University researcher who has been working to secure the future of one of the Northern Territory?s most prized fish species will travel to the United States this year to take up a Fulbright Professional Scholarship.<br /><br />Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods principal research fellow Dr David Crook will travel to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and Oregon State University to work with researchers on the behaviour of migrating fish.<br /><br />Dr Crook, who has been tracking the movements of barramundi in the Roper River and Kakadu National Park since 2012, will undertake collaborative research on barramundi from tropical Australia and Pacific salmon from temperate US.<br /><br />?Both species migrate between freshwater and marine habitats for spawning,? he said. <br /><br />?As migratory fish move between habitats they transfer energy in the form of carbon and nutrients, which are critical to local food webs where it helps sustain a range of ecosystem processes.?<br /><br />He said that the growing global human population?s increasing demand for fresh water put at risk fish migration networks and food web connectivity.<br /><br />?In many cases, fish migration pathways have been completely blocked and the associated flow of energy among ecosystems no longer occurs,? he said. <br /><br />?It is vital that we are able to better quantify the material transported by migratory fish to improve our understanding of aquatic food web structure and function to inform conservation and sustainable fisheries.?<br /><br />While in the US, Dr Crook will add to his ongoing research applying techniques including otolith (earstones) chemistry to improve understanding of the migrations and population connectivity of fish species.<br /><br />?Analyses of fish otoliths of barramundi and Pacific salmon will be used to quantify the transport of assimilated energy and nutrients across ecosystem boundaries by migratory fish,? he said. <br /><br />?The project will help support sustainable fishery management and provides an opportunity for ongoing collaboration among fisheries scientists in Australia and the US.?<br /><br />Dr Crook has 25 years of experience in fish ecology research within the government and university sectors. He has written more than 90 peer-reviewed scientific papers and book chapters, and was the 2010 winner of the Australian Society for Limnology's Early Career Excellence award. <br /><br />He will travel to the US in August.</p><!--

  <p>An internationally acclaimed philosopher, who specialises in the evolution of the human mind, is Charles Darwin University?s 2018 Charles Darwin Scholar.<br /><br />Daniel Dennett is Professor of Philosophy and Co-Director of the Centre for Cognitive Studies in the School of Art and Sciences at Tufts University in the United States and will visit the Northern Territory for two weeks in September as the Charles Darwin Scholar.<br /><br />Professor Dennett?s research focuses on the philosophy of the mind, science, and biology ?particularly how these fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science ? and the evolution of the human mind and what distinguishes it from other animals? minds in terms of consciousness. <br /><br />He will give two public addresses and hold seminars with students during his time in the NT. <br /><br />CDU Vice-Chancellor Professor Simon Maddocks said Professor Dennett was well known for his views and input to the long-running international debate among evolutionary biologists around socio-biology and evolutionary psychology. <br /><br />?His views ? coming from the position of a philosopher ? provide a perspective and analysis on how human minds have evolved that will be of great interest to both science and humanities staff and students at CDU, as well as to the wider public,? Professor Maddocks said.<br /><br />The Charles Darwin Scholar program is a biennial initiative established in 2013 to enhance CDU?s links to the work and legacy of its namesake, the naturalist, geologist and biologist Charles Darwin.<br /><br />Charles Darwin Scholars hold the honorary position for 12 months during which time they visit Darwin for a short period to deliver the Charles Darwin Oration, which is open to the public, and take part in discussions with staff and students.<br /><br />?Charles Darwin Scholars are eminent and accomplished researchers in either the history of Charles Darwin, evolutionary biology, or fields closely related to either of these areas, and are sourced from anywhere in the world,? Professor Maddocks said.<br /><br />?We are privileged that Professor Dennett has accepted this position and look forward to his visit to Darwin in September to deliver the Charles Darwin Oration.?<br /><br />Professor Dennett is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. <br /><br />Professor Dennett will arrive in the NT on 8 September and will give the Charles Darwin Oration in Darwin on Thursday, 13 September and in Alice Springs on Thursday, 20 September.

  <p>New research at Charles Darwin University has revealed the secretive bacteria helping cane toads survive Australia?s harsh environment.<br /><br />A research team has sampled bacteria living on the skin of about 100 toads in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, over a distance of 2500km.<br /><br />Evolutionary biologist Professor Keith Christian said cane toads had some control over their skin microbes by controlling their skin chemistry.<br /><br />?The microbes apparently act like an external extension of the immune system, by protecting cane toads from skin diseases,? Professor Christian said.<br /><br />?Our research shows there are differences in the community of microbes (called a microbiome) found on cane toads over a long distance, but there is a core group of bacteria that is present on all of the toads.<br /><br />?The differences are, in part, related to different microbes living in the soil in different regions, but we also suspect that some of the bacteria closely associated with the toads have evolved as the toads have invaded new environments.?<br /><br />Monday, 12 February 2018 marks the 209th anniversary of the birthday of acclaimed English biologist Charles Darwin, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution.<br /><br />Professor Christian said modern genetic technology allowed the team to detect slight changes within a type of bacteria.<br /><br />He said the cane toad research focused on gathering baseline information in the relatively new field of microbiome health and resilience, and hoped it could help inform native frog conservation in areas where, for example, a toxic fungus was killing frogs.<br /><br />The project began after Professor Christian and his colleagues Professor Karen Gibb and Dr Mirjam Kaestli analysed bacteria on the skins of five native frog species and cane toads, and found each species had a unique community of bacteria living on its skin.<br /><br />Professor Christian has researched the physiological and behavioural adaptations of various amphibians, reptiles, insects and micro-organisms in the NT since 1985.</p><!--

  <p>Poets, writers and literary scholars will gather to stretch their imaginations across the ?borderlands" of Australian literature, at a conference this week.<br /><br />Charles Darwin University will host the event for academics, postgraduate students, writers and teachers in literary fields alongside the Association for the Study of Australian Literature on 8 and 9 February at the Waterfront campus.<br /><br />Creative Writing Lecturer Dr Christian Bok said the theme of ?Desert Lines: Interventions in the Borderlands of Australian Literature?, would focus on creative writing beyond the boundaries of the canon and its mainstream readership. <br /><br />?The conference will draw on the imagination of scholars working in the fields of Australian literature, paying particular attention to writing beyond coastal centres and representing the Outback of the Australian imagination,? Dr Bok said.<br /><br />Dr Bok, a prominent literary academic, will deliver a keynote address on his current project ?The Xenotext? in which he is endeavouring to encode a poem into the genome of a germ (Deinococcus radiodurans), in a bid to create ?a living poem?.<br /><br />?I will showcase some of the ways that this work has allowed me to cross boundaries between many disciplines,? he said.<br /><br />Other scholars will present on topics pertaining to the Darwin region including runner up in this year?s Judith Wright poetry award Dr Lachlan Brown and 2013 winner of the Adrien Abbott Poetry Prize Bronwyn Lovell. <br /><br />Other presenters will include CDU Lecturers Raelke Grimmer and Ben van Gelderen, and Literary Studies and Creative Writing PhD candidate Leonie Norrington.<br /><br />Dr Bok also will run a creative writing master class on the theme ?Writing Beyond the Lyric? where he will share the principles behind techniques for teaching creative writing at the ?borders? of the discipline.<br /><br />The masterclass will be held on Thursday 8 February, which will be followed by the seminar on Friday 9 February at the CDU Waterfront campus.

  <p>Charles Darwin University is partnering with the Northern Territory Government to deliver a new international student hub in the heart of Darwin.<br /><br />Work is underway on the fit-out for the Hub in the Smith Street Mall.  <br /><br />CDU Vice-Chancellor Professor Simon Maddocks said that all international students studying in the NT, whether they were enrolled with CDU or with other NT providers, were welcome to access the Hub for general information, activities and support. <br /><br />?The Hub also will be open to all Territory students who are looking for information about their education pathway,? Professor Maddocks said.<br /><br />?We want the Hub to be a meeting place for students, a place where they can connect with each other and with others in the community. <br /><br />?A positive experience shared by students has ongoing impacts in attracting further students.<br /><br />?International students are vital for sustained growth in the education and training sector and the Northern Territory economy,? he said. <br /><br />The Hub is being funded through at least $156,000 in support from CDU and $150,000 in support from the Northern Territory Government.<br /><br />Chief Minister Michael Gunner said international students were an integral part of the community, contributing socially, economically and culturally to the Northern Territory.<br /><br />?To grow international student numbers we?re working with education providers, businesses and multicultural organisations to increase the range and quality of education offerings and Territory experience to students.<br /><br />?There are more than 2300 international students studying in the NT. As an industry international education contributes, $81 million to the Territory economy,? he said.<br /><br />International education was the ninth largest export for the Northern Territory in 2015-16, and the education of international students is Australia?s third largest export.<br /><br />The Hub will open later this month. <br /><br /></p><!--
