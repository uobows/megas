Having become known to a wider audience thanks to his collaborations with floor-savvy artists like Portable or Patrice Bäumel, the Sao Paulo native doesn't aspire to be a DJ, but instead delves deeper into live performance in a club context - which led him to become that rarest of all things, a live electronic musician holding residencies in regular clubs without ever so much as touching a record.
Even in the broad and pretty undogmatic sonic landscape that is electronic music today, he's a rare sight: Laercio Schwantes aka L_cio, the man with the transverse flute. Having turned quite a number of heads with his instrumental contribution to Portable's massive 2014 crossover hit "Surrender" ("Best New Track" at Pitchfork, among others), it's not been Laercio's first encounter with electronic sounds - a series of hybrid collaborations, projects and releases sitting squarely between acoustic and synthetic modes of production show a trained instrumentalist and live performer that knows his way around the studio, too.
Born in Sao Paulo to a deeply religious family, Laercio has been around music all his life - amidst the challenges of daily life, his adventist parents would whip out all sorts of instruments whenever the situation would allow it, introducing a young and curious mind to a wide range of musical expressions. It should come as no surprise, then, that our hero quickly felt at home with notes and bars, choosing the flute as his first weapon of choice which he eagerly studied from the age of seven. Even later non-musical career choices always reflected an infatuation with the world of sounds, like his stint as a capoeira teacher, combining martial arts, acrobatics and dance.
With such a multi-faceted background in music, the inevitable tinkering with synthesizers and other means of electronic sound generation was rather a question of time than one of ambition, and sure enough we find Laercio roaming the parties of the mid-noughties, absorbing the unique melange of styles and scales that inform club culture to this day. In stark contrast to most other rave inductees at the time, however, he never wanted to become a DJ: his area of expertise is the performance, not the collecting and curating of other people's releases, and it shows in the unusual fact that Laercio has held club residencies as a live electronic musician in venues like Sao Paulo's The Edge without ever so much as touching a record.
It's a charming anecdote that Laercio presented his presented his first demos to a light jockey and not to a club DJ or promoter, but he did so knowingly, always appreciating a different angle and preferring a free-form approach to musical expectations - instead of locking himself up in standardized delivery. Maybe that's why he's held in such a high regard as a contributor by a growing number of dance floor artists such as Portable or Patrice Bäumel, all the while exploring his own sounds in the club trenches as well as in the summoning pits of the studio.

<p>His second love belongs to photography. The famous techno club Robert Johnson lifted its ban on pictures just for Herrmann, who captured images of the clubbers and pasted them up in an exhibit. It was also at Robert Johnson that he met Acid Pauli after a long evening studio session. It followed his first 12&rdquo; &raquo;Taunus&laquo; in 2008 and the album &raquo;L&ouml;sch dein Profil&laquo; in 2009, both on Acid Pauli&rsquo;s Smaul imprint.</p>
<p>And now, his debut on legendary Munich label Disko B records: &raquo;Trans Atlantik&laquo; is way more than a collection of tracks, it is the pure essence of all these images, impressions and emotions Daniel Herrmann gathered during hours of travelling. &raquo;Zeitraffer&laquo;, &raquo;Trans Atlantik&laquo; and &raquo;Android&laquo; are reminiscent to historic electronic labels like Sky or Brain and stand in tradition of Klaus Schulze or Kraftwerk, without remaining in the past too long.</p>
<p>Other highlights include cooperations with N.U. Unruh of Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten for &raquo;Musik aus Metall&laquo; and with the Danish Artist Kristina Kristoffersen aka Mono Girl for the fragile electro pop beauty &raquo;Watch Me Grow&laquo; and the sinister anthem &raquo;On A Spear&laquo;.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/artists/index/~4/7EM-8EBB9es" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";}i:18;a:6:{s:2:"id";s:36:"http://kompakt.fm/artists/king_so_so";s:5:"title";s:10:"King So So";s:7:"updated";s:25:"2015-04-09T14:19:28+00:00";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feeds.kompakt.fm/~r/artists/index/~3/60hmYrNL6Jk/king_so_so";s:7:"summary";s:1271:"The only widely known fact about King So So is that he is a King.  It is not entirely clear if King So So was born on planet Earth or somewhere in the sky.  Some biographies claim that King So So grew up with wolves in the deep forests of Siberia but later in his life studied taxidermy at the University of the Sky.   However, as no biography on his life is regarded as neither accurate nor based on first-hand knowledge, it is not even clear if King So So is actually a man.  Some lesbian groups (note: especially in South Africa and Australia), claim that King So So is in actual fact, a woman.
