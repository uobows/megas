As usual with these type of DVD sets, one should expect samples and highlights of the year's best feuds and championship matches - greatly expanded once again as the two brands establish their own respective titles.<br /><br />Disc One, at first glance of the contents list, appropriately appears to be very SmackDown-heavy, considering the critical positivity surrounding the brand going into 2017. First up was the WWE championship bout that saw perennial poster-boy John Cena claim the title from AJ Styles, a refrain of 2016's arguable feud-of-the-year, to tie with the legendary 'Nature Boy' Ric Flair at 16 WWE-recognised world title reigns.&nbsp; This wasn't the year for the Rumble match itself to get on the 'best-of' list, but second-time winner Randy Orton had his subsequent Elimination Chamber PPV match with Luke Harper included, foreshadowing a feud with the winner of the event's eponymous match. The Elimination Chamber match itself was one of the most coherent of recent times, and provided overdue WWE championship recognition for Bray Wyatt as he surprisingly defeated Cena, Styles, Dean Ambrose, The Miz and Baron Corbin.<br /><br />Whilst that would have set up the traditional WrestleMania main event, the three examples from this year's 'Superbowl of Wrestling' didn't include Orton's almost inevitable victory. Instead, we get Styles versus 47-year-old boss-man Shane McMahon (which, to be fair, built a slow start into a serviceably entertaining bout). The Cena &amp; Nikki Bella mixed-tag against The Miz &amp; Maryse was turgidly paced, and whilst the ensuing marriage proposal was highlight-worthy, the match itself is hideously misplaced on any 'best-of' list. In contrast, the feud between the phoenix-like Universal champion Goldberg and Brock Lesnar has been denoted by explosively brief, almost terse, matches. Lesnar's WM33 victory here was almost an epic by their standards, and began to approach double-figures in terms of minutes' length... almost as long as Goldberg's entrance down the interminable ramp. The crowd had fun counting the suplexes and spears though.<br /><br />The second DVD features more RAW, with two post-Superstar-Shakeup matches from Payback opening the disc. Alexa Bliss becomes the first woman to have held both brands' titles when she takes the RAW women's championship from Bayley, whilst the second features the objectively brilliant feud between Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman beginning to peak. A brief sojourn back to SmackDown sees the start of Jinder Mahal's initially unlikely but ultimately productive WWE championship run, taking the belt from Orton at Backlash.<br /><br />The first of three excellently free-flowing 'Fatal' matches on the set, this one a 5-Way match to determine the number-1 contender for WWE Universal championship, sees Samoa Joe overcome Reigns, Wyatt, Seth Rollins and Finn Balor. The Universal title bout at the rock-n-roll-retro Great Balls of Fire is one of that archetypal 'big fight feel', full of impassioned brawling, but ultimately unsuccessful for Joe. Sandwiched in between was the first ever Women's Money-in-the-Bank ladder match, but the good-to-excellent bout was marred by the thoroughly objectionable finish. Carmella comes away with the case in circumstances shrouded in understandable feminist controversy.<br /><br />The final fight of the DVD is the tag-team championship match between The Usos and The New Day. New Day gain the SmackDown gold after previously holding their RAW equivalents for so long; Xavier Woods looking particularly dogged, enough to get his first belt-winning pin.<br /><br />Summer Slam opens the third DVD, and the long-awaited reformation of SHIELD (two-thirds of). Ambrose and Rollins take the RAW tag-titles from Sheamus and Cesaro in a bout that manages to be both brutal and technical. The other match from the 'big-four' PPV is the delightfully outstanding Universal championship Fatal Four-way. Seeing Strowman manhandle Lesnar like a cruiser-weight to demolish consecutive announcement tables is a rare sight, but the champion returned after<br />&nbsp;medical attention to retain against a resurgent Reigns.<br /><br />Bliss underlines her 'Five Feet of Fury' moniker, defeating Bayley, Emma, Nia Jax and Sasha Banks in the final fine 'Fatal' fight to retain her title at No Mercy, which also provided a clash of titans in the form of Cena versus Reigns. No matter which side the perennial detractors fall, this is an exemplar match of WWE's heavyweight Sports-Entertainment style, both technically and narratively.<br /><br />A casual observer, using this DVD set to stay moderately up-to-date on WWE goings-on, may be forgiven for thinking that Shane McMahon is a top-tier major draw, judging by a second inclusion. The match with Kevin Owens at Hell-in-a-Cell is a worthy addition though, if inevitably a little formulaic. Sami Zayn makes a timely intervention to cement the restoration of his and Owens' friendship, and save his Canadian compatriot from Shane-o-Mac's 20-foot cage-top plunge.<br /><br />The set concludes with the strongest technical match-up: Styles versus Balor, a veritable exposition of intricacy and almost Indy-level pace, but one, no-matter how you look at it, that missed the gun narratively. As a last-minute replacement match it is mind-blowing, but a year-or-so before it would have been the battle of the Bullet Club (even if they couldn't call it that), or with some build-up it might well have been 2017's pure gold.<br /><br />The opportunity cost and logistics of getting this set out for the biggest (Christmas) market, means that Survivor Series onward is absent from the set, a grave omission in terms of narrative build for 2018, but commercially understandable. Other than a somewhat weak WrestleMania selection, this represents a great value-for-money coherent anthology of WWE's year, and a solid addition to a fan's<br />collection.<br /><br />You can buy this DVD set from our good friends over at <a href="http://wwedvd.co.uk/" target="_blank">WWE DVD UK</a> and give them a follow on twitter @WWEHomeVideoUK";s:12:"link_replies";s:176:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/54827618413321636/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2018/01/dvd-review-wwe-best-pay-per-view.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:80:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/54827618413321636";s:9:"link_self";s:80:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/54827618413321636";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2018/01/dvd-review-wwe-best-pay-per-view.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:1;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-3871092130966401160";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-11-28T03:23:00.001-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-11-28T03:27:23.008-08:00";s:5:"title";s:62:"Jinder Mahal: Someone To Look Up To And Admire By Pete Stevens";s:12:"atom_content";s:7429:"<div><div style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p91CEZ7AvYE/Wh1BeyaB_EI/AAAAAAAAE_4/ruT4KvdIB2QHU49tmbxzYHz9gje5UFRRQCHMYCw/s640/blogger-image-147797495.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p91CEZ7AvYE/Wh1BeyaB_EI/AAAAAAAAE_4/ruT4KvdIB2QHU49tmbxzYHz9gje5UFRRQCHMYCw/s320/blogger-image-147797495.jpg" width="213"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mahal in his previous incarnation with the WWE</td></tr></tbody></table></div>Recently I?ve been thinking a lot about the pro wrestling business. I?ve been a part of it (10 years) and a fan for a combined 30 years. I?ve taken just lately to writing about my thoughts and feelings on certain subjects and this is another one.&nbsp; </div><br>I recently read online that during a press tour of India to promote WWE?s upcoming show, Kane was quoted as saying that Jinder Mahal is a superstar that should be admired for his change in attitude. Kane makes reference to Mahal?s 2014 release and spoke about the way Mahal conducted himself while being away including becoming a better wrestler and the drastic changes to his physical appearance. I understand that this interview took place in India to promote the forthcoming show which Mahal is due to headline in a match against the COO of the company Triple H however, it got me thinking.&nbsp; <br><br>In the bigger picture, should we all not respect Jinder Mahal for his most recent accomplishments a little bit more than we do?&nbsp; <br><br>I understand that some purists and wrestling die hards were outraged when the company went left field and chose to put the WWE Championship on Jinder and the rise of the ?Modern Day Maharaja? began. I admit, I thought it was going to be a transitional champion kind of situation and the company would keep with the safe cards like AJ Styles (champion now) or Randy Orton. A near enough 6 month reign would be the result of it all which even if you appreciated it or not brought fresh new light into the tired and tested main event scene.&nbsp;<br><div><br></div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-16pQWbgFVAg/Wh1DwEKfHRI/AAAAAAAAFAE/6ZroKVIGQ_U2cHNzOSTIMu-kASLN1QP7QCHMYCw/s640/blogger-image-208295942.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-16pQWbgFVAg/Wh1DwEKfHRI/AAAAAAAAFAE/6ZroKVIGQ_U2cHNzOSTIMu-kASLN1QP7QCHMYCw/s320/blogger-image-208295942.jpg" width="320"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mahal with his 3MB cohorts heath Slater &amp; Drew McIntyre</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">In 2014 Jinder Mahal was released from his contract. At the time of his release he was a member of 3MB. Prior to 3MB he had bounced around the mid card with a couple of mediocre winning streaks. He was the runner up to Seth Rollins in the final of the NXT Championship Tournament and was also the on screen brother in law to The Great Khali. Jinder was re-hired by the company along with Curt Hawkins, Rhyno, Shelton Benjamin and a few others to bulk out the rosters during the brand split. Not long into Mahal?s return he begun to make some big changes to his physic and attitude in the ring whilst finding himself in a team with Rusev. Mahal would look like an absolute beast leading intro Wrestlemania where he again came second in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal however, the ground work was already being laid down for him to rise to the top of the Smackdown brand and lead it as it?s champion.</div><br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--pBDw8gPNYI/Wh07J638M-I/AAAAAAAAE_g/xWkAQ0pkejAobIui2H6PVhD2IAqaZZsGgCHMYCw/s640/blogger-image-827403379.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--pBDw8gPNYI/Wh07J638M-I/AAAAAAAAE_g/xWkAQ0pkejAobIui2H6PVhD2IAqaZZsGgCHMYCw/s200/blogger-image-827403379.jpg" width="200"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mahal in more recent times when he was WWE champion</td></tr></tbody></table>Taking a step back from his accomplishments during all of this I?d like to go back to concentrating on the point Kane was making. Jinder Mahal is a character. Love him or hate him he isn?t real. Yuvraj Singh Dhesi was giving a second chance with a company that doesn?t really give second chances very often (okay goldust being the exception) and he chose to reinvent himself to give himself a fighting chance to survive. <br><br>As I said earlier wither you like him or not as a performer it?s immaterial.&nbsp; Personally I feel he should be admired and ultimately looked up to as someone who took the measures to better himself within his workplace to stand out from the pack instead of just filling the hole in the roster which ultimately he was brought back to do. Take a quick second to look at the rest of the returning stars. Rhyno was Tag Team Champion and got a push on smackdown but has done nothing since the brand switch moved him to Raw. Curt Hawkins gimmick is that he?s lost every match since the start of his career and Shelton Benjamin has been shoved into a 2.0 tag team. You may argue that Mahal has done nothing but alter his appearance and that his level of wrestling skill hasn?t changed at all. Against the skill of the veterans I mentioned above I would strongly argue that if his push was solely based around in ring skill then chances are he would be jobbing to the stars as well and in some way maybe he knows that. Look into his past again for a second. WWE tried multiple times with Jinder to make something of him and nothing happened. When he was Average Mahal you never saw him knocking down doors to get to any championship glory.&nbsp; <br><br>In an industry STILL (WWE at least) dominated by big men with impressive physical appearances Mahal has perfectly played the one card he did have for success and he played it extremely well.&nbsp; <br><br>Changing his physical appearance is the best thing Jinder Mahal has ever done for his career and it says a lot about his personal character and his willingness to want to succeed. He was given a second chance at a dream career where he hadn?t made the best of it the first time round and has hit a home run this time round.&nbsp; <br><br>Surely that?s something to look up to for anyone in any industry.&nbsp; <br><br>I?d call this a dream come true.&nbsp; <br><br>Pete.&nbsp; <br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:184:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/3871092130966401160/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/11/jinder-mahal-someone-to-look-up-to-and.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/3871092130966401160";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/3871092130966401160";s:4:"link";s:90:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/11/jinder-mahal-someone-to-look-up-to-and.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:2;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-2301853801946668689";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-11-20T12:39:00.002-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-11-20T12:48:09.858-08:00";s:5:"title";s:73:"WWE Network: We Wish You The Best In Your Future Endevours By Joel Yentis";s:12:"atom_content";s:9674:"<div class="s2" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 21.6px; text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MiKuJnp8FZs/WhM9g83LAHI/AAAAAAAAE-4/LDnwvMhw_m0wbfZP5BG68xBwQKLATJMyQCLcBGAs/s1600/network.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="615" height="208" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MiKuJnp8FZs/WhM9g83LAHI/AAAAAAAAE-4/LDnwvMhw_m0wbfZP5BG68xBwQKLATJMyQCLcBGAs/s320/network.png" width="320" /></a></div><span style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">I have decided, I am cancelling my WWE Network subscription.

This DVD was dedicated to that with a list of NXTs top 25 of all time. In the last review I did, I covered the ?30 Years of Survivor Series? DVD and in that I was very critical. However, the things I criticised were improved and I can?t see a fault in this DVD.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">&nbsp;</span><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b>Disc 1:</b> </i></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">We start off with Tom Phillips giving a brief introduction to NXT. He name drops a few alumn who?ve gone on to do great things and then the list gets underway.. The list entries have a video package but with sections in between, quizzing other WWE/NXT stars about the performer. This was really well put together and this is what the survivor series dvd, in my opinion, was lacking.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The top 25 were all deserving of their place on the list. There was a few surprise entry numbers. That was bound to happen though. The list of illustrious superstars included greats like: Triple H, William Regal and John Cena. It was also very cool to see the NXT Superstars and alumn talk about their peers in such a positive way. Also, it was great to reminisce and look back at some great gimmicks and matches.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Cesaro made the list, which wasn?t a shock considering what he did for the brand in its early days. A lot of people picked up on that. His feuds with Sami Zayn and William Regal should definitely be in the conversation for best rivalry in NXT?s early days. Like I just mentioned, it was great to see peers praise Cesaro and his contribution to NXT.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">One which surprised me was Paige. She defitnitely deserved to be put on but due to the situation she?s in with WWE at the minute, I wasn?t sure that she would be. A big name who didn?t make the list such as: Roman Reigns or Dean Ambrose could?ve made the list instead. It was easily done. In my opinion, Paige definitely deserved a place on the list over those two.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The superstar input wasn?t scripted and you could definitely tell. It added a sense of sincerity which can?t be faked. It was wrestlers giving their genuine thoughts on their colleagues. This was made more apparent on Alexa Bliss? entry more than anyone?s. Many stars said that they didn?t believe she was going to do much in the WWE. Reminiscing about her old cheerleader gimmick, it was crazy to see how far she?s come. The change from over-the-top cheerleader to intense bad girl was drastic and will arguably go down as the best image change in NXT history.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Tyler Breeze made the list! I love Tyler Breeze, he?s my favourite NXT wrestler of all time.. His schtick was so original and he had the charisma to perfect it. He put on solid matches and the NXT higher ups thought that much of him, they used Liger?s one off WWE appearance in a match against him at NXT Takeover: Brooklyn. The fact that he?s gone to SmackDown Live and is now doing something completely different to his NXT gimmick while perfecting it to the same degree, proves that he?s a fantastic performer.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">NXT Tag Teams got their own segment prior to the Top 10 countdown but none of them were ranked. It was a collection of video clips for each team. The Vaudevillians were included and it was cool to see Simon Gotch again I guess. The Ascension was really cool to see at their most dominant. A lot less like the Road Warriors cosplayers they later became. Enzo and Cass at their best, The Revival in their earlier days and DIY were all welcome additions to the list. It was a great compilation of teams and the tributes were fitting to the guys that made NXT weekly TV so entertaining.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The new generation of NXT was represented by none other than Ember Moon. Although receiving a low placement on the list, it was still cool to see her on it. It felt like just yesterday she debuted and wowed everyone with her appearance and unique in ring offence. It just adds to the point I started off this review with, NXT are really great for creating stars in a short time.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Finn Balor. His position is high obviously and I think it?s also pretty predictable. However, it?s predictable with good reason. Finn Balor elevated NXT and is the longest reigning champion in the brands short history, putting on barnburners every time his championship was on the line. Every time Balor was in a feud with someone it felt like a big deal.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This disc finished on a positive note, looking to the future of NXT and all the stars on the rise. Superstars name dropped here included: Aleister Black, Billie Kay &amp; Peyton Royce and Ruby Riot.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">Disc 2:&nbsp;</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This disc had a collection of classic NXT matches including an untelevised contest between Xavier Woods and Big E Langston from 2011.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">My 5 Match Recommendations:</i></div><ol style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">&nbsp;Non-Televised Match - Big E Langston vs. Xavier Woods - NXT (Pilot Episode)&nbsp;</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">NXT Championship Match - Seth Rollins vs Corey Graves - NXT January 2, 2013.</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Fatal 4-Way Match for the NXT Championship - Adrian Neville vs. Sami Zayn vs. Tyler Breeze vs. Tyson Kidd - NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adrian Neville vs. Tyler Breeze - NXT January 15, 2014.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Antonio Cesaro vs. Sami Zayn - NXT June 12, 2013.</span></li></ol><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">Disc 3:&nbsp;</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Like the disc before it, this had a collection of NXT classics.

I sat and watched the discs back to back to back and  have the following to say about the set.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">Disc 1:&nbsp;</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The  DVD kicks off with no introduction or host/s with the only thing given  being the Survivor Series transitions they've been using for the last  few years. The first disc is a top 30 of the best Survivor Series  moments. It felt like an hour long YouTube video. Don't get me wrong, I  thoroughly enjoyed the disc but I feel like it could've been put across  better.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Each  place on the list has a video package similar to those used in WWE  today and boy have the video team knocked it out of the park here. I  have a few issues with placements on the list but nothing too drastic.  Do I believe that number 1 should've been number 1? Yes, without a  doubt. Despite being controversial and pretty obvious, it couldn't have  been anything else. It also felt nice that everything on the list  deserved to be on it and that none of it was just there to fill places  up. It was also nice to see people no longer affiliated with the WWE  involved in the list too. People like Demolition, CM Punk, Hulk Hogan  and Alberto Del Rio all featuring prominently.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Another  thing that could've been improved was the amount of information given.  We were just presented with the video and had to make our own  assumptions. There is a list with names of moments online at  wrestlingdvdnetwork(dot)com but you shouldn't have to go out of your way  to find it. I'm not going to spoil the list placements but I'm going to  give you my personal favourite moments that were put on the list.&nbsp;</span></div><ol style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The Undertaker Returns at Survivor Series 2004</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The Shield Debut</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The First Elimination Chamber&nbsp;</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Winner Takes All - Team WWE vs Team Invasion</span></li><li style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Team Cena vs Team Authority / Sting Debut.</span></li></ol><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I  don't have much to say about the first disc besides the lack of  information and the presentation of the list leaves this DVD with the  untapped potential of being fantastic.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">Disc 2:</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The  second disc is a collection of matches from the earlier Survivor Series  which were mentioned on the list.

I wasn't sure if the lack of bigger  stars would have an effect on this feature. There was no Stone Cold,  there was no Rock and there was no Triple H. As time passed and as I was  getting more invested, I can tell you that the star power didn't matter  at all. If anything it just made it more interesting. 'Dawn Of The  Attitude' was a joy to watch from start to finish and I found it to be  very insightful.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">We  start things off with the superstars describing the wrestling industry  at the time. 1997 was a big year for WWE. Times were changing, the  ratings war was in full swing and superstars were given an opportunity  to use their personalities as their in ring persona. This gave a lot of  stars the chance to shine. 1997 was a much simpler time in the wrestling  business. You'd never have to worry about your character looking  'weak'. Wins and Losses never mattered and you wouldn't have to deal  with hate on twitter.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Slightly controversial topics included talks about Sunny and Chyna.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">The Guys:&nbsp;</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;">Shawn Michaels:&nbsp;</i>Shawn  recalls 1997 being a good year for him, his degenerate persona really  helped him turn his negative backstage attitude into positive for the  WWE. The first meeting of the Raw is War era was Vince telling the guys  to put more of themselves into their characters. He remembers Vince  being stubborn, the attitudes backstage were positive towards the war  because all of the guys knew that WWE would be the last one standing.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Shawn  was a very positive part of this DVD. He'll make you laugh, he'll  intrigue you and you won't get bored of anything talks about. Definitely  put in to be the leader of the table, Shawn shows that he certainly  doesn't lack in charisma and makes for a good watch.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;">Mick Foley:&nbsp;</i>Mick  never imagined himself playing Mankind. As a youngster, he always  wanted to be the chick magnet. Bruce Prichard himself saw tapes of the  promos Mick did as an 18 year old and this led to Mick's series of  interviews with Jim Ross which he describes as really opening up his  character.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Think  you know all of the backstage groups? You probably don't know about  this one! (If you do, well played) 'The Nerd Kliq' was a group of only 3  men. Kane, Mick Foley and Al Snow. The guys would chill out watching  documentaries and reading books which completely contrasts with what was  previously stated about personas. Looking back to 1997, you would never  be able to guess that Mankind and Kane were avid readers.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Mick  was definitely a huge part of WWE in 1997 as he is in this feature. He  had rather interesting stories and takes and he just added to the  natural feeling this interview gave off. None of the guys at the table  were uncomfortable and I think Mick played a big part in that.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;">Ron Simmons:&nbsp;</i>Simmons  gives us information on how he arrived in WWE. Vince would ask him a  question, he'd answer bluntly with no beating around the bush. He said  whenever he'd have an issue with race he'd tell the truth. Mick turns  this into a light hearted joke asking if Ron asked Vince what was on his  mind when Vince gave him The Sultan's helmet. This attitude of Ron's  lead to the Nation of Domination's Farooq.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Ron  made his presence felt for sure. I was unsure about Ron being in this,  heading in but by the end I was glad he was. He definitely contributed  to discussions well.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;">The Godfather:&nbsp;</i>The  first thing The Godfather talks about was being in the background of  the Nation of Domination as The Rock was being built up to become the  megastar he is today. "Me and D'Lo were just there to take stunners and  that's when I knew something had to change". Mick and Godfather recall  the creation of his character and tell the story of how it came to be.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Oh  The Godfather is great in this. I've always found Charles Wright an  interesting man to read about/listen to. Everyone frequently talks about  the three faces of Foley but no one really talks about the four faces  of Mr Charles Wright. I felt the same about Charles as I did about Ron  coming in and once again, I'm glad he was in it.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;">Kane:</i>&nbsp;1997  was a good year for Kane. He mentions how the fact that the wrestling  aspect of WWE in 1997 took a backdrop to the character aspect was a big  help to his career. Kane is such a down to earth guy and this DVD made  it apparent.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Kane  didn't really talk much throughout this feature which is made evident  by my lack of notes on him. This is probably to do with the fact that  Kane debuted in October of 1997 and may not have had as much to say as  the other guys did. He was still a very welcome addition to the panel  and I don't think he was out of place whatsoever.</span></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><b style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><i style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); outline: transparent solid 0px;">Disc 2:</i></b></div><div style="-webkit-touch-callout: none; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 0px; outline: transparent solid 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Disc  2 is focused on matches and segments from the first half of 1997.

He's a  former two-time NCAA All American. He's a grand-slam champion in both  TNA and WWE, not to mention holding the WWE heavyweight championship on 4  separate occasions.  He was the 2000 King of the Ring winner and even voted #1 Wrestler of  the Year in the 2001 PWI 500. And to top it all of - he's the only  Olympic gold medalist in WWE history. This legend is truly one of the  best of all time, and this DVD set proves it.<br /><br />The  first disc of this set covers the first 18 months of Kurt's WWE career  and really reminds you of just how good he has been from the very start.  From his debut at Survivor Series 1999 against Shawn Stasiak to winning  the European Championship from Val Venus  just 3 months later and then defeating Chris Jericho for the  Intercontinental Championship at No Way Out 2000 and unifying both  titles. His beginning in WWE is second to no one. His KOTR victory over  Rikishi is also on here and reminds you just how good a  match this was. Then comes his first WWE championship victory over The  Rock at No Mercy 2000 and successful defences against Undertaker and  Triple H. The first disc ends with the amazing match against Shane  McMahon at KOTR 2001. One of the most entertaining  matches from around that time and definitely helped show just how tough  Shane-o-Mac is.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tVjRFpVWDhg/WYIDTAZAP2I/AAAAAAAAE9M/ui1VusRAay8SSL9cUaHPU9YY_Bmb9jnRgCLcBGAs/s1600/vs%2BShane.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="390" data-original-width="590" height="211" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tVjRFpVWDhg/WYIDTAZAP2I/AAAAAAAAE9M/ui1VusRAay8SSL9cUaHPU9YY_Bmb9jnRgCLcBGAs/s320/vs%2BShane.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Here is Angle vs Shane McMahon from King Of The Ring 1998</td></tr></tbody></table>The second disc has more great matches against the  likes of Stone Cold in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Edge, the WWE debuts  of John Cena and Rey Mysterio; and even a hidden  gem against Hulk Hogan from KOTR 2002. Watching this DVD helps show  just how good Kurt is at changing his style against opponents with such  unique styles over the years. But, this disc ends with a fantastic match  between Kurt and Brock Lesnar at Summerslam  2003 in a rematch from their Wrestlemania 19 classic. This, once again,  was an instant classic. The third and final discs has another match  against John Cena, also showing the classic footage of the infamous  battle rap between the pair. It also shows a match  between he and Eddie from Summerslam 2004 which is good, however I  would've much rather preferred this to be their match from WrestleMania  20 earlier in the year. Then, we get the match which was match of the  year 2005 in PWI against Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania  21. This match is nothing short of phenomenal, just like their Iron Man  rematch which follows. We are then treated to a fantastic triple threat  match involving the pair and John Cena. All 3 men were at the top of  their game here.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eKHFdrtzjcc/WYIFNwRsFjI/AAAAAAAAE9c/wcGWPfj0YHs6c1dZNZOWYRJw0nZyDuWawCLcBGAs/s1600/vs%2BHBK.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="722" data-original-width="642" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eKHFdrtzjcc/WYIFNwRsFjI/AAAAAAAAE9c/wcGWPfj0YHs6c1dZNZOWYRJw0nZyDuWawCLcBGAs/s320/vs%2BHBK.jpg" width="284" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Classic Wrestle Mania 21 match against Shawn Michaels</td></tr></tbody></table>The final match on this disc  is an entertaining bout for the ECW Title against Rob Van Dam. But the  true ending on this set is how Kurt Angle has finally came home to the  WWE after 11 years. He is a different man to the one who left back in  the Summer of 2006. He's overcome his demons,  started a beautiful new family and is now the best man he can possibly  be. Inside the ring, he lived a legendary career and will go down as one  of the best of all time. And it's fantastic to see Kurt back on our  screens again each week as the General Manager  of RAW. But it's outside the ring that means most to Kurt. These days  he lives his life the way he lived his Wrestling career - with the 3  I's: Intensity, intelligence and integrity. He truly is an Olympic hero,  inside and outside of the ring; and this DVD  set truly shows it. It's true, it's DAMN true!!!<br /><br />You can purchase this DVD set from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwedvd.co.uk/kurt-angle-essential-collection-p-12373.html?osCsid=4ac9a9946a055fa5517c51a3b81733ae" target="_blank">WWE DVD UK</a> for £19.99 ";s:12:"link_replies";s:184:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/2742707576006159708/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/08/kurt-angle-essential-collection-review.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/2742707576006159708";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/2742707576006159708";s:4:"link";s:90:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/08/kurt-angle-essential-collection-review.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:8;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-8968317028649634140";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-07-02T09:21:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-07-02T09:31:08.562-07:00";s:5:"title";s:55:"WWE 'The Kevin Owens Story' DVD Review By James Russell";s:12:"atom_content";s:22907:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcphwQyedcA/WVkfwVu3KdI/AAAAAAAAE8s/UW3cQAtms98ix8nK5ORW6_ykXAb8lB2QwCLcBGAs/s1600/cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="520" data-original-width="520" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcphwQyedcA/WVkfwVu3KdI/AAAAAAAAE8s/UW3cQAtms98ix8nK5ORW6_ykXAb8lB2QwCLcBGAs/s320/cover.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>It never ceases to amaze me how down to earth this  man is. As much as he loves the wrestling business, nothing means more  to him than his family and that is apparent from the very beginning of  his story. Kevin  Yannick Steen was born May 7 1984 and raised in Marieville, Quebec. We  don't learn much of his childhood other than one day, for some reason,  his dad decided to rent a wrestling tape. It was Wrestlemania 11. Shawn  Michaels vs Diesel in the main event. Being  a scrawny 11 year old that looked more like he was around 8 years old,  he immediately looked up to the heartbreak kid because he was the  smaller guy battling the giant. He became obsessed. From that day on it  was "wrestling, wrestling, wrestling", according  to his father. Then eventually the day came - he wanted to train. Kevin  admits that when he got in the ring he wasn't particularly good at it  and his elbows were hurting a lot and his head was pounding from it. He  immediately started to doubt himself. His  mom worked nights and when she called to ask him how training went, he  admits he told her he wasn't sure it was for him and he was already  thinking of quitting. She was blown away because she knew how much  wrestling meant to him. Lucky for us fans, the next  day he put a mattress outside, carried on practising and working hard  and stuck at it. The following day he went back to the gym and thought  "let's do this". We then hear a story from his old friend, Neil  Felzenstein. He says he showed up to this wrestling  school in the middle of a flea market and there's this kid doing 450  splashes and blowing everyone away. Kevin was definitely the star pupil.  He had his first match at just 16 and made his parents proud and  immediately began to make some waves. Sami Zayn then  talks about how he'd heard about this Kevin Steen guy from his friend  and asked if he was any good. His friend responded, "he's really good,  but he knows it, he's kind of a jerk too". So even from such an early  age, Kevin has never had a problem with self  confidence or rubbing a few people the wrong way. Steve Corino talks  about Kevin's confidence in himself at just 18. He immediately thought  he was amazing and the future of the wrestling. We see early footage  from his career from the IWS (International Wrestling  Syndicate) promotion against guys like El Generico (Sami Zayn) and his  friend Neil. He used moves from everybody. Rock Bottoms, Stunners, even  split legged moonsaults were in his arsenal! But the biggest moment of  his (and Sami's) career came when one of the  IWS guys, SeXXXy Eddie, went down to Philadelphia based promotion CZW  (Combat Zone Wrestling), for their death match tournaments. He severed  an artery in his arm and began to drink the blood from his arm.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XIxuD3Uw-Yo/WVkYj7SxsEI/AAAAAAAAE8c/9_aW_Jw_N9UrKMdU5qOBBEvbaSBfr2cpQCLcBGAs/s1600/steenzayn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="300" data-original-width="450" height="213" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XIxuD3Uw-Yo/WVkYj7SxsEI/AAAAAAAAE8c/9_aW_Jw_N9UrKMdU5qOBBEvbaSBfr2cpQCLcBGAs/s320/steenzayn.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Steen with good friend and sometime rival El Generico</td></tr></tbody></table>This  made people take notice and made them think, "hey,  these Quebec guys are nuts", according to his friend Neil. They then  brought a couple of guys to a CZW show for a match. Kevin vs Generico vs  SeXXXy Eddie vs eXceSs 69 in a fatal 4 way match. They stole the show  and immediately opened up doors, not just to  Philadelphia and the east coast but to America. This opened to door for  PWG which led to ROH which led to wrestling around Europe. We then see  some footage from Kevin's early days in Ring of Honor. 'Mr Wrestling'  was his nickname back then because of how good  he was. Johnny Gargano, Neville and AJ Styles talk about how amazing he  was and there was nothing he couldn't do. He was untouchable, even back  then. Neville then talks about as impressive as his in ring work was,  it was his trash talk that separated him from  everyone else. There was nobody better. However, growing up in Quebec  he couldn't speak English, so he learned how to speak English from  wrestling - specifically Jim Ross. Sami even talks about how back then  there was a lot of 'Good God Almighty' coming out  of his mouth! Kevin tells a great story about meeting Steve Austin in  an airport in 2005 and asking him for any advice. Austins advice was  never stop trash talking - which was fine to Kevin because he loves to  talk! We then see footage from the ROH Driven  show back in 2008 in Boston, where Tyler Black (Seth Rollins) and Jimmy  Jacobs (Chris Scobille, who now writes for the WWE) lost their ROH Tag  Team Championships to Steen and Generico. Rollins and Jacobs both say it  was the biggest pop they had ever heard  up to that point when the referees hand hit the mat for 3 and they won  the titles. Steen and Generico definitely had something special and were  well and truly made men with the ROH fans. They were only second to  Bryan Danielson. Sami talks about driving back  after a show and talking with Kevin. He says Kevin has always been a  'hands on kinda guy', especially when it comes to his career and he just  felt like something needed changing. Kevin says he felt like they had  run their course as a tag team and needed something  fresh. He decided they needed to split. They mapped out a year long  storyline and took it to ROH. Steve Corino talks about how he showed  this sort of creativity at such a young age and knew he needed a change  and took the risk. And it was definitely worth  the risk. Final Battle 2009. Kevin spoke after the match to Generico  about how much he loved him and they hugged in the centre of the ring.  2000 people applauding. Some crying. Goosebumps all over the building.  And then Kevin turns and says..."I hate your  fucking guts!" And puts Generico down. This is the moment, not just in  Kevin's career but Generico too, where they both took the next step and  became something special. They both had a year long feud and constantly  stole the show. It was the hottest feud on  the indies, according to Neville. And it was exactly what ROH needed at  that time according to Corino. 12 months had gone by. Final Battle  2010. The match was made a loser leaves town match. New management had  come in to ROH, specifically Jim Cornette, who  clearly didn't believe in Kevin as much as everybody else did. So he  gave Kevin some time off, however from Sami's POV, Kevin was basically  told to leave. This left a sour taste in his mouth. This was his job,  his livelihood. He made a family, had recently  gotten married and now he has to sit and watch for god knows how long.  So he basically abandoned wrestling, in his own words. So he made his  family his number 1 priority over wrestling and essentially walked away  from it for 6 months. He did a podcast with  a buddy and was asked "what's next?" And he had no answer. He  considered quitting. Sami says he and Kevin's father spoke to him and  tried to remind him to take this seriously and not walk away from what  he's wanted his whole life. Then Kevin wrestled at a  PWG show and that helped turn it around for him. He decided to change  things up a bit. At ROH Best in the World 2011, he returned to the  promotion after Steve Corino announced 'Mr Wrestling has returned to  Ring of Honor'. He stood on the balcony, in street  clothes and the entire building shook. Jimmy Jacobs says he had never  felt anything like that. He was carried out of the building by security  and says he 'felt like Jesus on a cross'. He became the ROH version of  Stone Cold in Steve Corinos opinion. No matter  what he did, they loved him because he was the Everyman. Almost a year  later at ROH Border Wars 2012, he won the ROH World Championship. But in  his opinion it was too late.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AbPpuFAijxU/WVkZG8KqK0I/AAAAAAAAE8g/JQqN4TZOXPAZXmiScGTMq8EORBDc6CinQCLcBGAs/s1600/SteenROH.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="503" data-original-width="403" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AbPpuFAijxU/WVkZG8KqK0I/AAAAAAAAE8g/JQqN4TZOXPAZXmiScGTMq8EORBDc6CinQCLcBGAs/s320/SteenROH.jpeg" width="256" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Steen as ROH champion</td></tr></tbody></table>They were giving him the title because  they had no choice. In Jimmy Jacobs' own words  it had to be him. There was nobody else. Kevin admits it wasn't as  special as he'd imagined it would be. Then not long after Sami had his  tryout with WWE and even signed his contract in front of Kevin. He  didn't do this to rub it in his face, but because they'd  been through everything together and he wanted to share it with his  best friend. However, to Kevin, this stung. Knowing Generico is going to  WWE and he's nobody near that. He still had 2 years left on his deal  with ROH. And times were tough for Kevin. Sami  admits he wanted him to join but was worried he wouldn't get his  chance. Seth Rollins holds his hands up and admits "right here, I'm one  of his best friends, but I never thought Kevin Owens would be a WWE  wrestler because he just doesn't look like a WWE wrestler".  Then we see Triple H and William Regal talking about how they changed  the direction they were going in and started watching more independent  guys. William Regal was backstage at a PWG show and was there  specifically to watch Kevin. Triple H says he remembers  Kevin telling him the story about Regal watching him and he told Kevin,  "Who do you think sent Regal there to watch you?" Kevin had a great  match with Johnny Gargano but was only wrestling for one person that  night. He took that as maybe the only chance he  has to get his foot in the door at WWE. And he more than impressed  Regal. He got his tryout. Kevin admits the tryout was the hardest thing  he'd ever done and even started crying when he went into the bathroom  because of how much pain he was in. Then he was  asked to cut a promo. Standing there in a PWG t shirt, he cut a promo  on his best friend, Sami Zayn. He talked about when "Sami signed the  contract in front of him. And how much he hated that because he's the  best in the world. And now Kevin Steen has arrived".  He says he immediately knew he was signed after that promo. But, he  asked Sami if they had told him this when he was signed - "Don't expect  anything..." No they hadn't said that to Sami. But they had told Kevin  that he "shouldn't get his hopes up for Raw and  Smackdown because he's not someone Vince is looking at right now. He  should concentrate on NXT and just see how it goes". Sami says it best -  "look how that turned out". Kevin talks about how he got goosebumps  before his first NxT match when the WWE then now  forever promo video was playing whilst he stood backstage. He thought  about his family at home. His dad in the crowd. Then the promo video  started and he saw his face on the screen and realised "Holy Shit. This  is real. It was perfect". At the end of that  same show, his best friend Sami Zayn finally won the NxT championship  and was congratulated by Kevin - before being turned on and attacked.  Immediately he was in the main event picture, and with his longtime best  friend too. He captured the title from Sami  not long after in February. A month later he was at Wrestlemania as a  fan and promised himself this would be the last time he'd be there as a  fan. We see some great backstage footage of him talking to Hulk Hogan  and The Rock and both greatly complimenting  him. Triple H admits Kevin Owens probably had the shortest term in NxT.  Then not long after, John Cena hand picked Kevin for the US Title open  challenge and went to Vince with the idea. It was approved. Elimination  Chamber. US Champion vs NXT Champion. We  see amazing, touching footage of his son at home reacting to his Dad  fighting John Cena. It truly puts into perspective what I said at the  beginning of this - his family mean more to him than anything in his  world. The reason he chose the surname Owens when  it was to be changed from Steen in NxT is because his sons name is  Owen. So to be that little boy watching his Dad on TV defeating John  Cena at Elimination Chamber in May in his first WWE PPV match, I can't  imagine how great that felt.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DacyfWqFpBg/WVkan64zwqI/AAAAAAAAE8k/MTX2RD2NrPc4nS1RzJDfYnO-yIkIIQfLwCLcBGAs/s1600/owenscena.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="444" data-original-width="800" height="177" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DacyfWqFpBg/WVkan64zwqI/AAAAAAAAE8k/MTX2RD2NrPc4nS1RzJDfYnO-yIkIIQfLwCLcBGAs/s320/owenscena.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Owens confronting Cena on the WWE main roster</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;We then see footage  of him talking after the match about how it doesn't get better than  that - before saying he's going to call his son. It was only a couple of  months before he was a major player in the game. He won the  intercontinental championship at Night of Champions in  September. That started a long feud between him and Dean Ambrose over  the championship. A few months go by, and it's Wrestlemania time again.  We see footage of him standing in the ring before the show and reminding  us what he said the year earlier - "that  would be the last time ever as a fan". He was right. We see him talking  backstage with some of his peers, guys he admits he looked up to as a  child - Scott Hall and X Pac. And then he bumps into Stone Cold at the  Gorilla position. From when he gave him advice  in an airport in 2005, to giving him advice before his first ever  Wrestlemania match, his career had well and truly come full circle. Sami  admits standing in the middle of the ring at Wrestlemania watching his  best friend walk down the ramp was unbelievable  and still gets goosebumps thinking about it now. Kevin admits after  that match if that would've been his last, he would've been a happy man.  We then see Jimmy Jacobs talking about how his career had come full  circle when he took a writing job with WWE and  now works with his good friend Kevin once again. He says one reason  he's as good as he is - is because nothing is ever good enough. He's  always pushing for more and more and more. He wants to the best. Neville  repeats the same statement, before saying he's  a bit of a prick. But, outside of the ring, he's far from a prick. He's  the best father and husband his family could ask for. Without them, he  would be nothing. Payback 2016. Kevin Owens vs Sami Zayn. One of the  best matches of the year. Jimmy Jacobs admits  it's one of the best matches he's ever seen live. They well and truly  stole the show and both felt on top of the world. But then Summerslam  was around the corner - and he was teaming with Chris Jericho against  Enzo and Cass. He admits its no disrespect against  them but that wasn't where he wanted to be. He felt like he deserved  better and was better than that position on the card. He was right. But,  as luck would prevail, Finn Balor won the first ever WWE Universal  Championship pinning Seth Rollins. However he got  injured during the match and had to relinquish the title. Enter Kevin  Owens. It was a fatal 4 way Elimination match on Raw to determine the  new champion. Roman Reigns vs Seth Rollins vs Big Cass vs Kevin Owens.  After Cass was eliminated, Triple H entered the  ring and delivered a pedigree to Reigns, allowing Rollins to get the  pin. Then, after entering the ring, he turned on Seth and delivered a  pedigree to him before he and Kevin stared at one another. 1...2...3.  Kevin Owens is the new champion. Kevin Owens is  the chosen one. He admits that he owes literally everything to Triple  H. From sending Regal to PWG to watch him. To the tryout. To giving him  the opportunity in NxT. And now this. He literally handed Kevin the  championship. We see footage backstage of them  both embracing, before he hugs Vince McMahon, the man who at one time  wasn't looking for someone like Kevin Owens.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tOk_FSlaeMw/WVkbNHqz0AI/AAAAAAAAE8o/3sbvEX7nxyMuKlLEqyqjBcsCmAE-fvdZACLcBGAs/s1600/owens%2Buniversal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="540" data-original-width="850" height="203" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tOk_FSlaeMw/WVkbNHqz0AI/AAAAAAAAE8o/3sbvEX7nxyMuKlLEqyqjBcsCmAE-fvdZACLcBGAs/s320/owens%2Buniversal.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Triple H raises Owens' hand after helping him win the Universal title</td></tr></tbody></table>We see Sami taking about  how he couldn't believe what he was seeing and had no emotion, it was  only when Kevin walked through the curtain and  they hugged. We see an emotional moment with Kevin's father talking  about how proud he is of his son. Then we see footage of his son  watching his dad win the championship and getting emotional. His dad is  literally the man. Daniel Bryan talks about how he  believes he's as good as he is because he never stops. He never thinks  good is enough. Johnny Gargano reiterates this statement and mentions  how he was 'never a WWE guy', well look at where he is now. He's the  man. Neville admits if you'd have told him 10  years ago that Kevin would be WWE champion he'd have told you to go  away. Triple H believes talent rises and Kevin has all the talent in the  world, he just needed an opportunity. Seth says what separates Kevin  from every other guy is the fans can relate to  him. He's got his finger on the button at all times and Sami reiterates  this too. He says Kevin always makes himself relevant and makes sure  he's the best he can be. But, as it comes full circle, Kevin ends the  story saying that as good as he is, he would  be nothing without his wife and his kids. And as long as he's got them,  then he will be fine. The Kevin Owens Story is one a lot of people can  relate to. He's always been the underdog in a sense, always been backed  into a corner. From being the scrawny kid  looking up to Shawn Michaels doubting himself to doing 450 splashes in  IWS. From Jim Cornette not believing in him and considering walking away  from the business, to that PWG show with William Regal watching. From  being told not to expect Raw and Smackdown  and get his hopes up because he's not what Vince is looking for, to  becoming the Universal Champion. Kevin Owens has fought to get where he  is today, it's like Triple H said - "he has all the talent in the world,  he just needed an opportunity". The match listing  for this DVD is fantastic. The only downside is there couldn't be any  ROH matches on here. Other than that, this is a stellar DVD. His debut  match in NXT is on here against CJ Parker, which is just a generic match  enabling Owens to show the NXT fans what he  can do. But then there's his title victory over Sami Zayn at NXT  Takeover: Rival and this is a great match, which should come as no  surprise. His shocking debut victory over John Cena at Elimination  Chamber is also on here, as well his his first Intercontinental  Title win against Ryback at Night of Champions. There's a brilliant  Last Man Standing match on this against Dean Ambrose from Royal Rumble  2016. However, in a match that I didn't remember but is honestly  brilliant, he goes up against Dolph Ziggler on an episode  of Main Event from April 2016. Definitely worth a watch! There's also  another hidden treasure as KO and Triple H face off against Sami Zayn  and Dean Ambrose at a house show in Paris, also from April 2016. Now,  this next match is KO vs Sami from Battleground  which is a stunning match, make no doubt about it - but, on the  documentary, Jimmy Jacobs calls the match they had at Payback one of the  best he's ever seen. And it was an unbelievable match. So to exclude it  from this DVD seems very odd indeed. Nevertheless,  next up is the entertaining fatal 4 way match where he wins the  Universal Championship which I talked about earlier. Then there is a  very good Hell in a Cell match against Seth Rollins, which I consider  highly underrated. Then, the final match on this DVD  is his Wrestlemania 34 match against Chris Jericho. This match is very  good, however I don't think they reached their potential during the in  ring aspect of that feud. Finally, I have to say this is a fantastic DVD  set and definitely worth the money. It follows  him throughout his career and shows enough IWS and ROH footage during  the documentary. Nevertheless I still would've liked to see some ROH  matches on this or at least some IWS ones. Also, excluding the match at  Payback against Sami seems odd but they more  than make up for the match listings with the documentary side of  things.<br /><br />I can be contacted on twitter&nbsp;@jamesrussell137 with any feedback. <br /><br />The DVD/Blu-Ray is available in the UK from July 3rd from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwedvd.co.uk/fight-owens-fight-kevin-owens-story-p-12371.html?osCsid=0a2ed63f04ce266393e2806e422ca7ba" target="_blank">WWE DVD UK</a> ";s:12:"link_replies";s:181:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/8968317028649634140/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/07/wwe-kevin-owens-story-dvd-review-by.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/8968317028649634140";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/8968317028649634140";s:4:"link";s:87:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/07/wwe-kevin-owens-story-dvd-review-by.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:9;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-5873213293360012563";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-04-28T06:38:00.001-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-04-28T06:38:19.606-07:00";s:5:"title";s:72:"WWE 'Diamond Dallas Page - Positively Living' DVD Review By Tim Ricketts";s:12:"atom_content";s:8157:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gXCmKO2FUog/WQNAxDLaRQI/AAAAAAAAE8A/ec-Z9Mkh59Mv32FMUNfFx6xA7yQJ5VFMACEw/s1600/DDP.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gXCmKO2FUog/WQNAxDLaRQI/AAAAAAAAE8A/ec-Z9Mkh59Mv32FMUNfFx6xA7yQJ5VFMACEw/s320/DDP.jpg" width="215" /></a></div>As a 90's teen, slightly WCW obsessed to boot, Diamond Dallas Page holds a very special place in my wrestling memories: alongside Sting, he stood out as a shining beacon of hope for the good guys against the depredations of the burgeoning NWO. So with that in mind, I approached this DVD with a mixture of excitement and reticence ? is this going to be a festival of my boyhood hero, or another opportunity for WWE to wave the victor's flag over The Monday Night Wars?<br /><br />This three-DVD set follows the usual WWE biography format, comprising of a documentary disc and two of supporting clips and matches. Dallas himself introduces and presents his own journey from the off, immediately giving the documentary an original autobiographical feel, particularly as he describes his less-than-perfect childhood, and the traffic accident that stole his early sporting potential.<br /><br />The novelty is amplified by the topsy-turvy route he took into wrestling. From owning a bar frequented by wrestlers, he ended up cutting a managerial audition tape that was picked up by the diminishing AWA, before joining 'The Dean' Gordon Solie on commentary for the Florida territory. Back into management, he represented the Freebirds in WCW; traditionally, these sort of roles went to ex-wrestlers or those in the twilight of their careers, but DDP's was only just beginning. At the age of 35, he headed to WCW's Power Plant training facility to begin his in-ring career. The vox-pops from Page's peers, present throughout the film, convey the incredulity well at this stage.<br /><br />Obviously, the documentary's focus continues on Dallas's outings for WCW, which include all of that promotion's major titles as well as the European title in WWE, but with the match selections on the other discs representing this period well, I'll just make a couple of quick points. As I've already mentioned, Dallas was one of the notable few who made any significant heroic stands against the villainously anarchic New World Order stable, and one particular moment at Souled Out. Turning on Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, after accepting their invitation to join as a decoy, he sprints through the adoring crowd in the sort of organic moment that prepends the 'Super' to the beginning of 'Star'. It also struck me how honest Page is about his unsuccessful stint in WWE, considering he tore-up a contractual guarantee from Time-Warner to go there<br /><br />Following the end to his improbably successful wrestling career, Diamond Dallas Page created a modified form of Yoga that spans physiques and abilities, DDP Yoga. Not only that, but he has used it (and his bottomless positivity) to give both Jake 'The Snake' Roberts and Scott Hall a new chance at life after they looked to have pressed their own personal self-destruct buttons. Whilst this film goes into that in a little detail, The Resurrection of Jake the Snake is recommended viewing on the subject. On that note, and the re-ignited relationship with WWE it provoked, this heart-warming tale reaches it's satisfactory conclusion with Page's sprightly appearance at the age of 59 in The Royal Rumble 2015 and a phone-call from old buddy Triple H to inform him of his impending Hall of Fame inclusion.<br /><br />The second disc contains some more documentary clips that must have missed the cut, mostly expansions of themes from disc one, but really worth the watch. A lot of humorous stuff, but the best is saved 'til last: the full audition tape DDP sent to Verne Gagne's AWA. It really does have to be seen to be believed. <br /><br />The match selection for the remainder of disc two, and the entirety of three, ranges from the solidly good (if not in technique or psychology, then for historic perspective) to the excellent. Twenty-one bouts in all on the DVD version, with the first batch focusing on the initial in-ring development of DDP. The first four matches are all tags, with the obviously still-green Dallas mostly teaming with his former managerial charges - the Diamond Exchange or Vegas Connection stables - people to whom he would become inextricably linked throughout his career. The Diamond Studd (Scott Hall), Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash) and Scotty Flamingo (Raven) all feature against an array of early-nineties WCW luminaries.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0UahB4R-NwE/WQNBWLFgxWI/AAAAAAAAE8I/e5zEW2dj1P04AbI6OehzMAEedKZxVLEgACEw/s1600/DDPHall.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="173" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0UahB4R-NwE/WQNBWLFgxWI/AAAAAAAAE8I/e5zEW2dj1P04AbI6OehzMAEedKZxVLEgACEw/s320/DDPHall.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">DDP with good friends Scott Hall &amp; Jake The Snake Roberts</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>&nbsp;Page also had plenty of singles feuds as he rose up the card during Eric Bischoff's tenure in charge, notably against Johnny B Badd, Randy Savage and Hulk/Hollywood Hogan, as well as United States Championship rivalries with Eddie Guerrero and Curt Hennig. All have a match included on the second DVD; not necessarily the ones I would have picked personally, but stand-up examples nonetheless. <br /><br />Disc three is a library of DDP at his zenith, opening with two of WCW's most infamous 'celebrity' bouts: with 'Mailman' Malone against Dennis Rodman and Hulk, and with chat-show host Jay Leno versus Hogan again, this time with Bischoff. Unsurprisingly the match involving the sportsmen rather than the TV personalities is the better of the two.<br /><br />The next pair have their own place in the tapestry of wrestling's past too. As thousands of paying customers missed DDP's Halloween Havoc '98 main event defeat to Goldberg when it over-ran the PPV time, it was repeated the following day on Nitro. At the end of the same episode, DDP got the US title from Bret Hart instead. The championships keep rolling on this DVD set, as this is followed with Page's first World Heavyweight win in an excellent four-corners fight featuring WCW's marquee talent Hollywood Hogan, Ric Flair, Sting and Special Guest Referee, Macho Man Randy Savage.<br /><br />Another pair from the same night again, as Dallas firstly lost the Big Gold Belt to Sting before a No-DQ four-way (also involving Nash and Goldberg) saw him regain it. DDP's Tag Title victory with Jersey Triad partner Bam Bam Bigelow against Raven and Perry Saturn is the penultimate match, whilst the quite frankly brilliant WrestleMania X8 bout versus 'protégé' Christian represents his post-WCW 'cup of coffee' in the WWE and rounds out the collection.<br /><br />There were a few matches I was a bit surprised <i>not</i> to see included, but they would bring the tone down somewhat. For better or worse, I expected to see DDP lose his third World title (won the previous night from Jeff Jarrett) to his own tag partner, David Arquette, in one of the greatest farces in history. I thought I might see Dallas's first major [TV] title win against WCW's ill-fated Warrior clone, the Renegade. Maybe the turn on the NWO at Souled Out. Mercifully enough, there was no source material on the Undertaker versus 'Stalker' DDP storyline.<br /><br />Just like the subject, this DVD set is an uplifting, relentlessly positive thing of joy.

as Enzo Amore calls it in the WWE 24 documentary  that forms the hub of this set.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">With  the documentary taking place in 2016, we get interviews with a cast of  superstars, many of them relatively new to the main roster and the  events directly after Wrestlemania 32, whilst established stars talk  about their experiences. &nbsp;Everyone speaks positively about the  post-Mania Raw, with emphasis on how raucous the crowd are and how big  an event that episode of Raw is.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">We  see big debuts, huge moments and it really does reinforce how important  the day after Mania is. &nbsp;It?s occasionally emotional (especially the  speeches) and there are certainly moments where longtime WWE fans will  get goosebumps (mostly for the returns).</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">JBL  says it best when he says that, for many fans, this is the last show  that the fans will do on the Wrestlemania weekend. &nbsp;It?s almost like a  final blow out for the fans and they want to go out with a bang. &nbsp;?It?s  almost like the Bizarro-world night,? says Sami Zayn, about the audience  interaction, and it?s pretty much true.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">Watching  the NXT guys as they step up to the main roster is a great moment, they  all speak highly of their experience and it?s by far the most  interesting bit of the documentary. &nbsp;When Amore and Cass speak about  their journey from developmental, the criticisms they received and the  work they put in, along with the faith that WWE have in their elevation  to Raw, it?s an emotional story and reflection at its finest, especially  when it's combined with historical footage of how they looked and  performed in the past.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">In  addition to Amore and Cass, we see Apollo Cruz and Baron Corbin move to  the main roster, and the arrival of Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson,  reunited with AJ Styles, as they begin their WWE journey and Cesaro as  he prepares to return to WWE Raw. &nbsp;All speak eloquently and openly about  their experiences.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">Whilst  it?s great hearing from the WWE Superstars and experiencing the  behind-the-scenes work that goes into making Raw happen as we wait to  see new guys debut, there?s very little from the creative aspect as to  what makes it the ?new year? for the WWE. &nbsp;Stories aside, it?s a great  documentary if you want to experience the fans getting rowdy and watch  WWE praise WWE for being WWE. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">Clearly, this one documentary - running at 55 minutes - doesn?t fill all three DVDs.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">The  other two DVDs are full of Raw-After-Wrestlemania moments and, with  over thirty years of shows to choose from, there?s some truly great  stuff here.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">The  two discs benefit from being full matches and segments, instead of  highlights, but offer no more insight than the commentary - there?s no  comments from current day stars, nor is there any context really offered  to what we?re watching.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">We  do see Bull Nakano vs Alundra Blaze from 1995 showing how great women?s  wrestling used to be before it descended into titillation before  talent. &nbsp;Thankfully, the other women?s match chosen for this collection  is AJ Lee vs Paige from 2014.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">From there, it?s a mixed bag of history, with only a couple of years missing.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">There?s  a handful of championship matches, a few matches and moments that WWE  fans may have forgotten about and plenty of stuff that reminds fans just  why they continue to watch the product - Amongst others, we see Stone  Cold Steve Austin, Vince McMahon, Triple H and Shawn Michaels at their  finest on the microphone (and, in Michael?s case, Psycho Sid being?  well, Sid), Rick Flair?s retirement speech, Vince McMahon failing to  convince Steve Austin, Rock and Cena, Ultimate Warrior?s final  appearance, the return of the former 123 Kid, Goldberg, Brock Lesnar,  Hogan and the nWo, the ten team battle royale which saw British legend  Dave Taylor and William Regal in action, Eddie Guerrero vs Jericho and  much, much more.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">Hopefully,  for more recent fans, they?ll want to revisit moments past to discover  the story of some of these classic (and not so classic) moments,  especially with the likes of Guerrero, Regal, Blaze, Helms, The Sandman  and Tommy Dreamer featured, given how much footage is available on the  WWE Network.</span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">The documentary may not hold up to repeat viewings, but the two discs of matches and moments will.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 21.600000381469727px;">Order yours right now from&nbsp; <a href="http://http//wwedvd.co.uk" target="_blank">WWE DVD UK</a></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:184:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/4104058398434912050/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/04/wwe-wrestle-mania-monday-dvd-review-by.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4104058398434912050";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4104058398434912050";s:4:"link";s:90:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/04/wwe-wrestle-mania-monday-dvd-review-by.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:11;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-1851015285055145923";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-04-19T14:10:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-04-19T14:20:33.100-07:00";s:5:"title";s:50:"WWE DVD Review: Royal Rumble 2017  By Tim Ricketts";s:12:"atom_content";s:56507:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AZ2rIkkoWAg/WPfNwhnHHGI/AAAAAAAAE7M/pyx1IFQhotc-WUx0OUQ3aW9qlj4NNoEPACEw/s1600/RR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AZ2rIkkoWAg/WPfNwhnHHGI/AAAAAAAAE7M/pyx1IFQhotc-WUx0OUQ3aW9qlj4NNoEPACEw/s320/RR.jpg" width="227" /></a></span></span></div><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>  <o:AllowPNG/> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings></xml><![endif]--> <div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Royal Rumble, WWE's annual take on the Battle Royale match format, has reached it's thirtieth anniversary. So San Antonio hosts a very significant event, with a potentially great card. The titular match usually holds it's fair share of surprises, shock returns and twists with the severity of hair-pin bends on the Road to Wrestlemania. Four title matches on the under-card means that this DVD should be quality from bell to bell.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">With no 'Special Features' to consider, the show-proper started with melange of moments of significance in Rumble history, followed by a more up-to-date reel of of the significant feuds coming into this PPV, particularly Bayley/Charlotte, AJ Styles/John Cena and Brock Lesnar/Goldberg. A good little segment that segued to the first line-up of the continually rotating commentary team, who fervently started to build the importance of the Road to Wrestlemania, the significance of the 30th anniversary and, of course, the Alamo Dome, San Antonio Texas.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"><b>WWE RAW Women's Champion Charlotte vs Bayley</b> </span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Bayley looked the epitome of her ebullient self as she entered, whilst Charlotte took the Flair familial Ring-Robe gimmick into fantasy uber-villain territory with a look of supreme arrogance on her face. It was effective, as smug always winds people up.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Opening the match, and the card, Charlotte demonstrated her physical superiority over her smaller opponent. This only fired Bayley up, which culminated in a diving enziguri from the turnbuckle to Flair at the ring-side, followed up by a massive splash. She couldn't maintain the offence however, and Charlotte resumed her grinding pace and tactics. The champion became increasingly sadistic with frustration and began trash talking, which matched the arrogance of her entrance to a tee. It left room for some typical Bayley cheeky opportunism though, as always explosively high-risk, and led to a Macho-man elbow-drop that gave Charlotte a fat lip.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Despite a good showing by the fan-favourite compulsive hugger Bayley, Charlotte cemented an imperious victory to make it 16-0 on PPV, with a Natural Selection from the top turnbuckle to her recovering adversary, right onto the ring apron. It was merely a simple task to roll her in for a pin.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">A strong mix of psychology, exciting high-spots and grinding attritional power to open the show.</span></i></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Following this excellent opener, we saw the 'Shark Cage' being lowered to the ring before a highlight reel of last month's Roadblock: End of the Line PPV which Kevin Owens retain his title against Reigns thanks to 'Best Friend' Chris Jericho's disqualifying interference. The frequency of similar occurrences is enough for GM Mick Foley to stipulate the old-school cage as a means of insurance for this upcoming match.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"><b>WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens vs Roman Reigns (No DQ)</b> </span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Y2J played the fear of the cage to the hilt, then right at the last second jumped Reigns with Owens in tow. Reigns sent KO to the ring-side and quickly pummelled Jericho in to the cage to get the match started.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span> </div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">We were soon into some quality through-the-arena brawling, and it was no surprise when they hit the foreign announce tables. KO came out on top, so spent some time getting steel chairs in a stack. Avoiding taking that big-hit, Roman worked his power moves to eventually set up a table on the outside, only to take a massive Owens frog splash through it. No three count for the Canadian, so he went back to using the chairs to good effect before Jericho unstashed some brass knuckles and dropped them from his high vantage point. Still no luck for him though, as Reigns kept kicking out. A Samoan drop through a chair gave Roman a chance at a pin, but 'no dice' for him either, so he put a table in the corner of the ring. This gave KO chance to recover, try a stunner (another close pinfall) and climb up top, only for a recovering Roman Reigns to Superman-punch Owens through the pile of chairs that had been a tantalising tease all match. No pin attempt now though, as, playing the long-game, Reigns followed up with a bomb through the announce table.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Just as it looked like Reigns had the victory in sight, Braun Strowman surprised him (me, and probably a fair few others too) with an ambush, slamming the challenger through his own table set up. Owens had just enough wherewithal to roll his near-corpse over the remains of Reigns to retain.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">An incredibly well constructed Tables and Chairs brawl, with plenty of TLC-style action and pin attempts. That tall stack of chairs provided excellent anticipation before the shocking finish too.</span></i></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">More Rumble 'moments' followed, building effectively for the main event, and subsequent tombola draw of Rumble entries which featured the RAW and Smackdown management teams with Sami Zayn and Dean Ambrose picking their numbers. It seemed like a bit of a throwaway comedy skit.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"><b>WWE Cruiserweight Champion Rich Swann vs Neville </b></span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">A highlight package covered the background to this match, primarily concerned with the resurgent Neville's unapologetically single-minded quest to become 'King of the Cruiserweights'. It provided a meaty angle to this title match of the rebooted high-flying division.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Swann took to Neville with determination and athleticism to open the match, which demonstrated the fire and skill that landed him the belt, but soon Neville slowed the pace down and began his methodical grinding. Swann used the ropes well to break, given the opportunity, whilst the Geordie lad sadistically made full of every referee count. It wasn't all one-way traffic though, as Rich Swann managed a thunderous superkick as Neville flew in from the top turnbuckle, to mount a valorous comeback. He couldn't make good on it though, submitting when Neville twists his arms in to the brutal Rings of Saturn.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">I'm not normally the greatest fan of villains, but this new no-nonsense Neville could be King of the Cruiserweights for some time yet, given this showing against the internationally experienced Swann.</span></i></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"><b>WWE World Champion AJ Styles vs John Cena</b></span><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span></i></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Those of you who follow my DVD reviews may already be aware that I firmly believe Cena and Styles put on some of the best WWE matches of 2016, and this promised to be a gigantic reprise with the added 'sauce' of the title. Victory for AJ would mean leaving his First Anniversary show still as champion, but even more significantly for John would be that elusive record-tying Sixteenth world championship reign. In comparison to those epics, it did not disappoint: the stunning spiralling sequences of signature moves, counters, trips to the turn-buckles for some super-augmentation and knife-edge rallies of the previous bouts were all present, but with a different twist. To use the old Spinal Tap idiom, they 'turned it up to eleven'.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">John Cena looked to have the match in the bag with a ring-shaking super-AA that slammed AJ to the centre of the ring from many feet in the air, but Styles kicked out of the following pin attempt. He responded by locking in his eponymous 'Clash', but that couldn't keep Cena down either. It took a further two repetitions of an Attitude Adjustment to finally finish off the reign of Styles, and claim the sweetest of spots in the history book right alongside 'The Nature Boy' Ric Flair. This match really did that significance justice.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Main Event: The 30th Annual Royal Rumble match.</span></b></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The last highlight package of Royal Rumble statistics were run to lead in the match, before the commentary team took us through the rules. Essentially, 30 competitors enter with two minutes between each of them, elimination is by over-the-top-rope with both feet hitting the floor, last man wins.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Big Cass, who had the honour of the number-one draw, came out with partner Enzo Amore and delivered one of their tremendously popular promos, Pre-Rumble. 'Y2J' Chris Jericho was second, Kalisto third (who then had a good big man/little man moment with Cass) and Mojo Rawley fourth. The next music to play led to some serious excitement in my house, as Jack Gallaher entered, which meant the cruiserweights were being included, and he was utilising an umbrella to great effect. It wasn't just us British nutters who seemed to enjoy his surprise entry, the crowd in Texas were going nuts too. It was to be no fairy-tale though, Jack was eliminated first despite a Mary Poppins moment thanks to entrant six, Mark Henry. Braun Strowman was right out to cheer me back up, chucking Rawley, Cass, Kalisto and Henry over the top in short order. Sami Zayn arrived to continue his enmity with Strowman, and took two minutes of pummelling 'til Big Show entered the fray and provided a distraction. Good stare off, too. He slammed Braun, but was immediately forced out in retaliation.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">At number ten, it was the perfect point for the 'Perfect Ten' Tye Dillinger to make his main roster [re]début, which popped the crowd (and me), providing another top-notch surprise. He and Zayn stuck it to Strowman as James Ellsworth made his way, tentatively, to the ring. Ellsworth still hadn't made it in when Dean Ambrose appeared, but was easily tricked into diving in and being fodder for the elimination machine Strowman. Baron Corbin came out to make it a four-on-one on Braun who responded by adding Dillinger to his list, before he received a Helluva Kick from Zayn and a lariat from Corbin which sent him over-and-out. Kofi Kingston and The Miz entered next. Kofi continued his Rumble tradition of impressive escapes by almost impaling himself on a ring-post. Sheamus in, followed by Big E then Rusev in a protective mask and Cesaro, which made it quite a melée. Proper battle royale stuff. The commentary noted that Sheamus and Cesaro lost their Tag Titles to Gallows and Anderson on the pre-show, conspicuous by it's absence from this DVD. Xavier Woods entered to complete the New Day too.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Alamo Dome went dark and the fireflies came out as Bray Wyatt made his usual grand entrance and set to dealing some damage, although his explosiveness was one-upped by the incoming Apollo Crews. The New Day were eliminated en-masse by Cesaro and Sheamus before Jericho opportunistically tipped the squabbling pair over as well. The newest Wyatt family member, Randy Orton, rampaged at 23, Ziggler at 24 going after his recent enemies Miz, Ambrose and Crews. Another Wyatt, Luke Harper, was next, but reneged his family ties to unsuccessfully attack Bray and Orton. Brock Lesnar stormed the ring taking out Ambrose and Ziggler, and left the rest in a devastating wake of suplexes and F5's. Enzo Amore was the hapless subsequent entrant, rag-dolled straight back out by the 'Beast Incarnate'.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Goldberg made his trademark entrance as well at 28 (as if the pace hadn't increased enough), stomped down to the ring and speared Lesnar allowing him to be cast out the ring. Yet again the stadium darkened, this time for the supernatural presence of The Undertaker. Goldberg took out Rusev and Harper, whilst the 'Deadman' pitched Baron Corbin over the top before he made sure Brock's nemesis hit the deck too. Last man out to the ring, Roman Reigns, got a chorus of booing from the Texan crowd as he stared off with Undertaker. Not as much as when Roman tossed him out a few moments later, after he had taken care of Miz and Zayn. Reigns got some revenge for earlier by finally putting Jericho out, and the crowd's ire increased as another unwanted Rumble victory for the despised Samoan Superman loomed. The intense anger seemed to max-out seconds later as he took out the charismatic cult-leader Wyatt, but the pay-off came as Orton snapped off a trademark 'RKO outta nowhere' to stun Reigns enough to claim the win and his Wrestlemania Main Event slot.</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">And Finally...</span></b></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">This really does live up to my expectations of excellence from the start to finish, the under-card oozing with it's title match prestige, each one exemplary of it's genre, and a Royal Rumble that made up for a slight lack of genuine surprise entries with coherent narrative. On that note, an NXT call up and a solitary unexpected Cruiserweight competitor barely qualified as surprise, but they were timed so well that it kept the early momentum of the epically long match flowing. If moments of wrestling history that actually live up to their significance is what you want from a PPV, then this ticks every box.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="aolmailgmail-western"

You see, I like reading, have done since I was a kid, I also like wrestling, hence why I write about it so much and one of my treasured possessions is my Kindle (other e-readers are available) which is chock-a-block full of books, and most of them are about wrestling, in fact at the moment I'm alternating between two books about wrestling, and they are: A Lion's Pride a book about the history of New Japan Pro Wrestling and Power Slam Interviews: Volume One a book of interviews from the lifetime of British Wrestling Magazine Power Slam. I'm about halfway through each and thoroughly enjoying the read, Lion's Pride in particular gives a great insight into the history of a promotion many have just become acquainted with, and with the Power Slam book, I really enjoyed reading the book about the history of the magazine while I was on holiday last year and have only just got round to buying it, just in time for Volume 2's release.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, why am I talking about what I'm reading? Well, because in this article I'm going to highlight a few personal favourites and talk about them, because as with everything in wrestling, we need to encourage the writing of wrestling books for the enjoyment of fans worldwide, potential authors need encouragement after all, so for your enjoyment and to better your book collection, I attempt consumer advice. Enjoy.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u><b>The Death of WCW by R.D Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez</b></u></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">The death of WCW is all over the internet to be ridiculed by all, and quite often it is, but nothing quite covers the history and misgivings of a promotion that went so horribly wrong as this books does, written by the same men behind the website and books WrestleCrap give an informative and humorous read, I'd recommend getting the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Edition of the book as it include more content including all the 'Lessons Not Learned' after the closure of WCW, and an entire chapter dedicated to TNA, in comparison with the decisions made in the last few years of the deceased company. Also the audio-book version, read by Alvarez is worth a listen as hearing the stories read aloud somehow makes them more absurd, and more importantly, entertaining.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u><b>Mankind: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks by Mick Foley</b></u></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">Really, all four of Mick Foley's memoirs could appear on this list, but I'm trying my best to keep it to one book per author, so I'm including his first book, which is somewhat of a trailblazer in the wrestling autobiography world as he wrote it all himself, without the aid of a ghost-writer, and what's more he wrote it all in shorthand, as he was computer illiterate at the time, it's somewhat of a revelation too, as Mick comes across as the world's most likeable, charming man telling his story which took him from sleeping in his car and travelling 600 miles to training all the way to winning the WWE World Title, all the time telling his story in his own charming style, what's even more impressive is he kept this up through FOUR books, it was also a best selling phenomenon, who'd have ever though that the guy who fell off a cell would ever be a New York Times Number One Best Seller, three times in fact! A book that set the standard for all wrestling books to follow it.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u><b>A Lion's Tale by Chris Jericho</b></u></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">Again, a case of any book could have been included Jericho has written three volumes of his autobiography so far, with a fourth to be released in the summer and like Mick Foley before him, tells his story in a unique and entertaining way, dropping a lot of references as he goes, not only does it cover his wrestling career but his out of the ring exploits, including his band Fozzy, who I am a fan of also. This book covers his career up to his WWE debut, through WCW, ECW, Mexico and Japan as well as a bit of tragedy, some may prefer reading about his WWE runs, but to really get a measure of Jericho, you really need to start here. The Book of Jericho. Read It Maaaaaaaaaaaaan.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u><b>All Or Nothing by James Dixon</b></u></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">A book closer to home now, as James Dixon chronicles the turbulent life of 1PW, a British company which spent big, went through several pairs of hands, and ultimately went under into bankruptcy due to overspending and bad management, also, uniquely it's told by the wrestlers at the centre, the book is based around interviews about the events and paragraphs of exposition by the author to tell of the events behind the scenes and first hand accounts by wrestlers and personalities including the companies founder to tell it's story and as with WCW it's intriguing to read about a company self destructing, as intriguing as it is devastating for those involved.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u><b>Hitman by Bret Hart</b></u></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">This was a book that was long awaited, and one I've read many times over, Bret has had an unmatched career with many stories and title reigns, sprinkled with the bitterness that we've come to know from the Hitman in recent years, he's still a man who is clearly hurt, even almost 10 years on from Montreal at this point and possibly a man still grieving for his younger brother, taken by the industry he'd given his entire life to, in reading all the trials and tribulations of Bret, you feel many things, elation one  minute, devastation the next, it is a map of human emotion masquerading as a wrestling autobiography, and you should absolutely read it, as a wrestling fan, or as someone who is interested in the backstage stories of the late 80s and early 90s.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, there you have it, actual consumer advice, and what's more you can probably pick a few of these up for very cheap these days, especially the Mick Foley ones. Another one I'd recommend but couldn't put on due to my 'One Book Per Author' rule but deserves to be mentioned is Titan Sinking by James Dixon, it's a book about the worst year in WWE history, 1995 and it's a fascinating read.</span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="aolmail_gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">In conclusion, we should all read more, especially us wrestling fans, given how the mainstream perceive us as knuckle-dragging neanderthals, so let's prove people wrong. Also, tweet me if you think I've missed any.</span></div></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:184:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/4684197905796132564/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/04/wrestling-books-why-theyre-awesome-and.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4684197905796132564";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4684197905796132564";s:4:"link";s:90:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/04/wrestling-books-why-theyre-awesome-and.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu

font-size: 10.0pt;">This is a mammoth set for a mammoth year in the WWE, and trying to represent five hours of TV output per week, 52 weeks a year in only nine hours of DVD space is a mammoth task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In that samespirit of brevity and summary, I will get stuck into the content.</span></span> </div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The DVD opens with Jerry 'The King' Lawler introducing this archive of an important year for both brands, and the first match, with a cheap shot at the butterfly Divas belt of the women's old title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Charlotte versus Becky Lynch is a solid technical match with the champion's father, Ric Flair, heavily involved with the finish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>An appropriate pick as this would be a theme for Charlotte's matches in the first part of this year.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div

improbable victory for the US title over the recently returned Alberto Del Rio is a true underdog treat, despite being brutalised from the first moment and having his high-flying devastatingly countered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>January highlights follow, including Roman Reign's shot at 'Special [biased] Ref' Vince McMahon that set up the Royal Rumble match for the WWE Championship.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div

be an unpopular opinion, but Daniel Bryan's retirement speech - included here in full - is too long for a summary DVD of an entire year. I'm not doubting Bryan's impact on WWE and wrestling in general, but it slowed the flow of the DVD significantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully, it is followed by Chris Jericho versus AJ Styles from SmackDown. A 'dream match' that would have been fantasy booking a few years ago, although Jericho is marginally off his prime athleticism now. It doesn't suffer for that, as the beautiful clash of similar styles leads to a knife-edge match of precision technique.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Vincent J McMahon Legacy of Excellence award ceremony gets interrupted to the crowd's (and my) delight. Just as Stephanie McMahon is being presented by her father, brother Shane makes a stunning return after almost a decade. With notions of blackmail and backstabbing, this segment leads in to the upcoming battle for control over Monday Night RAW. Unsurprisingly, this subject also features in the February highlights.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WX30ZD30H-4/WMpga73O-_I/AAAAAAAAE6o/gZO2n1wuaVgKFKFHctvaku-_D3N3OuuowCLcB/s1600/Balor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WX30ZD30H-4/WMpga73O-_I/AAAAAAAAE6o/gZO2n1wuaVgKFKFHctvaku-_D3N3OuuowCLcB/s320/Balor.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">After Chris Jericho acted as WWE's gatekeeper to the incoming AJ Styles, they ended up together as a Tag team - Y2AJ. The title-match against The New Day didn't go according to plan however, leading to Jericho's turn on AJ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Triple H versus Dolph Ziggler started as a good match, but not as good as the ending: Roman Reigns interrupting and brawling with HHH throughout the entire arena, excellently invoking the spirit of the old Hardcore championship. A game of move-set one-upmanship between Kevin Owens and AJ Styles is followed by the March Highlights which continue the Roman/HHH feud on the road to Wrestlemania.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The King begins Disc Two with a preamble about the new faces of the 'New Era' beginning with RAW the night after Wrestlemania, which is immediately backed up with a serviceable bout between NXT alumni Apollo Crews and Tyler Breeze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Styles versus Zayn number one contender match puts us back on the World Class level though, an absolute throw-down. April's Highlights: a New Women's title, Zack Ryder's criminally short Intercontinental reign and AJ allying with Gallows and Anderson.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Cesaro and Zayn tag against Kevin Owens and The Miz in an astoundingly athletic tag match that is a brilliant snap-shot of the Intercontinental title scene, with the sauce of schadenfreude-inducing squabbles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This disc also has a massive change-of-pace discourse in the middle, John Cena providing the mid-ring monologue for this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Back after some time out, he sets himself up as some kind of guard or gatekeeper against the 'New Era' superstars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cue AJ Styles' entrance for a surprising bit of returned respect, interrupted by The Club threatening him. It's just a ruse to beat up John Cena though, setting up the Summer's hottest programme of matches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The May Highlight package focuses on the McMahon sibling rivalry and associated New Era brand positioning.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JA8IGGOtaxI/WMpen7KwSLI/AAAAAAAAE6U/XLxbYAyeXTcdMPsV8QzOxt8qkTEJV--GgCLcB/s1600/Owens.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JA8IGGOtaxI/WMpen7KwSLI/AAAAAAAAE6U/XLxbYAyeXTcdMPsV8QzOxt8qkTEJV--GgCLcB/s320/Owens.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">A couple of tag matches have been chosen to represent June, The New Day and Enzo &amp; Cass versus The Club and The Vaudevillains is an epic Promo battle only matched by the excellent in ring product, while Ambrose, Zayn &amp; Cesaro against Owens, Jericho &amp; Del Rio is a prelude to Money in the Bank, a 6-man tag that isn't just on here for the storyline narrative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With the Brand Extension draft looming, the highlights are densely packed: Ambrose 'the Dude' now WWE Champion, The Styles/Club versus Cena feud continues, some posturing cameos for a potential SmackDown GM and the Wyatt?s compound match against New Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shane and Daniel Bryan end up in charge of SmackDown, whilst Steph and Mick Foley get Monday nights.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Draft Day itself gets an introduction from Lawler as well as its own highlights, throwing up all of the seismic changes that this kind of structural shift brings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, we have four decisive matches to put the top-order of each brand into some kind of perspective.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Firstly, there's the Ambrose/Rollins WWE Championship match in which Ambrose needs to retain to go to into the Battleground Main event, with RAW's Rollins plus Roman Reigns confirmed, and keep Smackdown's hopes alive of holding the historic title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that he does in both instances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then comes Charlotte versus Sasha Banks for the (RAW) Women's Championship where Banks finally gets the gold, ending Flair's interminable run.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Balor makes a huge impact on RAW after the former NXT champion drafted highly, and gives himself a huge birthday treat by beating the big-dog Roman Reigns. This sets up the Summerslam finale crowning a new 'Universal' heavyweight champion, against #1 draft pick Seth Rollins, to headline the red brand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over on the blue side, AJ Styles wins an action-packed 6-Pack Challenge against Cena, Ziggler, Crews, Corbin and Bray Wyatt for contendership to the traditional title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Stylistically, these go to demonstrate the initial general differences between the brands; RAW with the traditional in-ring storytelling psychology but Smackdown high-paced and heavy on spectacular spots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>July's highlights mostly cover what we've just seen.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wW4DO6i1Pv8/WMpgLgPZcuI/AAAAAAAAE6k/BPmVYzES6fEcSAajdrngwbpahHOBUaLvwCLcB/s1600/Styles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="185" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wW4DO6i1Pv8/WMpgLgPZcuI/AAAAAAAAE6k/BPmVYzES6fEcSAajdrngwbpahHOBUaLvwCLcB/s320/Styles.jpg" width="320" /></a><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">The King's back again at the start of Disc Three, seemingly to put in a good word for NXT's American Alpha (Chad Gable &amp; Jason Jordan) before the segment segues into a Charlotte Flair in-ring promo. She regained the title at the previous night's PPV so wants the night off, but Foley has other ideas. After mentioning Finn Balor's relinquishment of the Universal Title due to injury, he introduces Bayley for her RAW début. Charlotte refuses her challenge, so she gives Dana Brooke a solid striking fight, and defeat, instead.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Lawler's mention of American Alpha makes sense as they take on Breezango (Tyler Breeze &amp; Fandango) in a 1st round tournament match. It demonstrates the potency and agility of the patriotic Alpha as they progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Next up is the Roman Reigns vs Kevin Owens vs Seth Rollins vs Big Cass (w/Enzo) fatal four way for the Universal Title after Balor's injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A gruelling visceral match is concluded with a screw-job and swerve of legendary proportions. Triple H turns on his former chosen one, Seth Rollins, to surprisingly set up Owens for the win.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Another fatal four-way follows. This time a fast-paced submission victory for Kendrick as he makes Alexander tap to become number-one contender, in RAW's first cruiserweight division match, also including Rich Swann and Gran Metalik.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A Miz TV segment begins with a retrospective of the Intercontinental champion's career, but after The Miz starts running down Dolph Ziggler he comes out to put his WWE career on the line for one last shot at the title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Subtle as a sledge-hammer in my opinion, but it goes over well with the crowd. The month's highlights follow.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Goldberg, the former WCW star, makes his return to WWE on Monday Night RAW after a 12-year absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Tying in with the 2K17 video game release, he challenges Brock Lesnar (his last opponent) to one more fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't a big fan of the former World Heavyweight champion the first time around, and less so a good stride into middle age, especially when there's so much fresh talent coming through from NXT.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DIt430RVAU/WMpe91Ccc8I/AAAAAAAAE6Y/gk-QeARU4kwIZDLX9kONeDJ7xwKqjm7OwCLcB/s1600/goldbergreturn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DIt430RVAU/WMpe91Ccc8I/AAAAAAAAE6Y/gk-QeARU4kwIZDLX9kONeDJ7xwKqjm7OwCLcB/s320/goldbergreturn.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">James Ellsworth, the sympathetically engaging recipient of a Braun Strowman squash on RAW, has become embroiled in the feud between Ambrose and Styles for the SmackDown World Championship in the next match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some quality comedy antics and classic JBL commentary are mixed with deceptively crisp in-ring action, making it a bit of an unexpected hit for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It's followed by yet more monthly highlights.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">Two Women's matches finish this set off incredibly nicely. Becky Lynch defends the newly-minted SmackDown Women's title against the diminutive but highly aggressive Alexa Bliss, and Sasha Banks nearly breaks Charlotte in half to regain the RAW championship during their Falls-count-anywhere match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Both of these only go to highlight the strides that female WWE competitors have taken in the past few years. A final load of November highlights round out the DVD set.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></b><b><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">And Finally...</span></b> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">These 'Best of RAW and Smackdown' DVD sets have a superbly unique point to them: ease of access to the most significant TV matches of the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even on the Network, it can be a major pain in the posterior to track down one match in an odd episode for reference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you combine it with the recent Best of PPV Matches collection too, then you get a sum greater than its parts, a chronicle of the WWE year.</span> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 10.0pt;">What a year it has been too!

to another DVD-packaged PPV review on Wrestling's Last Hope, this time December 2016's Roadblock: End of the Line, a RAW exclusive event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The main story-lines from the Monday night brand coming into this event involve a mess of nepotism behind Universal champion Kevin Owens' reign, a see-saw battle for the RAW Women's title between Charlotte's PPV dominance and Sasha Banks' TV glory, and The New Day's record tag-title run.  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The DVD 'Special Feature' is the pre-show match, so I shall tackle that first, as it makes chronological sense. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">&nbsp;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Big Cass (w/Enzo Amore) vs Rusev (w/Lana) - Special Feature</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">An unfortunate recent clothing and communication mix-up between Enzo Amore and Lana in a hotel has led to this match, where Big Cass and Rusev are essentially fighting as seconds for their partners' honour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A typically long entrance promo speech from Enzo and Cass, with plenty of audience participation, preceded the lock-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The fight quickly spilled over the barrier and into the crowd with Big Cass in the ascendancy, but as the Referee's count approached double-digits Lana shoved Enzo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cass showed his inexperience by checking on his team-mate, allowing the Bulgarian brute to roll in the ring with a second to go and claim the count-out victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Good ruse to claim a spurious victory, however the pre-match promo was longer than the fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was a good promo though.  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">RAW Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston &amp; Big E w/Xavier Woods) vs Sheamus &amp; Cesaro</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">After recently surpassing the record for longest tag team title reign, which now stands at 483 days, The New Day come to the ring crowing and dismissive of their squabbling odd-couple opponents. "Pride comes before a fall," as the saying goes, and New Day's complacency is evident by their reliance on the usual numbers-game tactics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The extra man is neutralised by the ingenious tactics of the European team though, as Sheamus patrols the ringside area in an enforcer role while Cesaro makes long imperious stands in the ring, more often than not against Kofi Kingston.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The New Day are successful in distracting the ref from a Kofi tap-out, but that is just a portent of the result. In one last blast of tactical genius, the Swiss Superman feigned a tag and allowed himself to be taken down by the resurgent Kingston.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A beautiful move that leaves the surprised Kofi susceptible to Sheamus' roll-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This match had everything, action, pace, tactics, psychology... except a particularly surprising result. How they got there was slick though. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">10 Minute Survival Match - Sami Zayn vs Braun Strowman</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Whilst I accept the might and prowess of Strowman, I don't entirely understand how Sami Zayn has gone from a hair's-breadth rivalry with the now Universal Champion Kevin Owens to being a squash-match whipping-boy in the space of six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Rather than engendering my sympathy, it made me feel rather more pitiful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Whether this conveys a genuine sense of "David and Goliath" or not, Zayn must fulfil the stipulation and survive ten minutes to win.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The first six and a half minutes is pretty much filled with Braun beating down and grandstanding above the hapless Zayn, turning down multiple pin opportunities before GM Mick Foley intercedes carrying a towel - the corner-man?s traditional method of signifying submission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sami rejects this token of weakness and dodges Strowman's charge, sending the giant into the corner-post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With only a couple of minutes left, we get what this match should have been from the get-go: Sami using his speed, skill and experience as an effective foil to Strowman's size and strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Unsurprisingly, Zayn sees out the 10 minutes to claim 'victory'.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Seth Rollins vs Chris Jericho</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The usual highlight reel conveys the basis of this grudge: Rollins jilted as the 'favoured face' of WWE by Triple H in favour of Jericho's friend Owens Universal Champion, Jericho's interference in their follow-up bouts, and Seth's subsequent parking lot ambush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some good, old-school, alliance-based feuding.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The match opens with some good mat work and striking from Rollins, but as soon as Jericho gains a foothold he begins to take control. When Rollins starts to look bright again, Jericho drops down to ringside to slow him back down. Rollins uses one of his favourite barricade attacks, so Jericho rolls back in and utilises a traditionally nefarious thumb in the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Quite literally, he uses his current low morals and canny knowledge to stop any Rollins' momentum in classic Y2J style.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Seth recovers only to be kicked off the ring apron, but beats the Ref's count out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Chris continues grinding work on the mat and ropes, Rollins only making his comeback when he painfully foils Jericho's Bulldog, and starts building toward a finish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That's when the inevitable Kevin Owens appearance and interference occurs, despite 'BFF' Jericho's previous pleading, but spectacularly backfires. The disoriented Jericho succumbs to a pedigree and a pin-fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I suspect that this breach of trust will have an effect on the Main Event.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Cruiserweight TJP vs The Brian Kendrick vs Rich Swann (c)</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">A triple threat is the classic match format for the high-kicking and high-flying cruiser-weights, their fast pace and spectacular counter moves always underlines the 'threat'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is a superb example of that, the opening minutes flowing excellently between the current and two former title holders demonstrating their pedigree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The exhausting pace quickly takes it's toll, as first Kendrick, then Perkins, attempt to force a submission from the champ.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Swann battles back and takes advantage of his momentary alliance with TJP, dual-kicking a recovering Brian Kendrick to the floor, to quickly roll the CWC winner into a successful pin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is a solid, action-packed match that establishes Swann's dominance of the division and over his predecessors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The '205-live' colour-commentators provide a quality soundtrack, their lively banter contrasting with the often stayed and steady flow of their Raw counterparts on the other matches.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Neville, Swann's tag-partner of yore, makes a surprise appearance, kicking and beating the living hell out of TJP and Rich, who's face is a picture of pain and betrayal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A shocking about-face from the former fan-favourite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With that mention of betrayal, there's a little back-stage segment involving Kevin Owens ranting at Chris Jericho's locker-room door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It seems like it's a case of 'Sorry, not sorry' from the Universal champion, about the involvement in his friend's match.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">30-min Iron-man match - Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks vs Charlotte Flair</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">These two have feuded, and traded the title, consistently over the previous few months, with Flair's unbeaten streak at Pay-per-Views always seeing the championship return to her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These often brutal matches have established the women at the top of the card, and following October's record-making Hell-in-a-Cell fight, this Iron-man match looks to continue the rivalry.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The first ten minutes are an absolute grapple-fest, trading and chaining holds, strikes, locks and pin attempts, before the match descends into ringside brutality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sasha can't regain a foothold after she gets bounced, headfirst, off the ring-steps, eventually leading to the first pin-fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Charlotte nails the 'Natural Selection' from the top turn-buckle to break the deadlock with a third of the match left, and immediately presses her advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Banks is dynamite though, with an acrobatic detonation she takes a feint at a rana and comes down in control of Flair's arm, rolling her up to level at eight minutes remaining. Two minutes later, she's in the lead, Charlotte tapping to the Bank Statement.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Flair fixates on Banks' knee, softening it up effectively for a Figure-four leg-lock, pummelling it and laying in her wrenching submission. With seconds to go, Sasha taps, levelling the score.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ref Chad Patton sanctions sudden-death overtime, playing into the hands of the fresher Flair, but it's The Boss who makes a couple of quick pin attempts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That's as far as her rally gets, as she taps, blood streaming from a facial wound, to the bridged Figure-Eight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Flair's PPV run continues, as does the resurgence of female wrestling in the WWE. Bravo to these athletes on such a gruelling rivalry.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">WWE US Champion Roman Reigns vs Universal Champion Kevin Owens</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Following his earlier appearance and backstage rant, Owens looks to be dealing with this fight without his former 'Best Friend Forever'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He launches into it, and it spills quickly to ringside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Owens seems determined to Frog-Splash the imposing Reigns wherever possible, off the barricade, through an announce table or even in the ring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">As he starts to lose dominance, Kevin becomes increasingly desperate; he grabs the title belt, only to be speared by Roman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It's at this point Jericho runs-in and puts the Code-breaker to his ex-BFF in an apparent attack of spite, handing him the DQ victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Seconds later the ruse is revealed, Y2J handing Owens the belt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A good twist to keep the narrative going, but one that was far too easy to telegraph.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">The action doesn't finish there though, as Seth Rollins follows his earlier opponent out and forms a mini-reunion with former SHIELD team-mate Roman Reigns to dish-out double-power-bombs to Jeri-KO through the remaining announce-tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This adds a little more intrigue to the mix, and satisfaction for the ending.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And Finally...</b> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">This is a very worthy PPV offering from WWE, with the landmark Tag Title and Women's matches living up to their historic significance and the main-event narrative thread providing plenty of amusement, however predictable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Cruiserweight effort is good support too, though the Zayn-Strowman and Pre-show matches left me distinctly uninspired.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Available now from www.WWEDVD.co.uk</div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:185:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/5946274895099213322/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/03/wwe-roadblock-end-of-line-dvd-review-by.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/5946274895099213322";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/5946274895099213322";s:4:"link";s:91:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/03/wwe-roadblock-end-of-line-dvd-review-by.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:15;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-6016911107427156018";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-03-02T01:06:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-03-02T01:06:31.165-08:00";s:5:"title";s:47:"My Top 10 matches of ALL Time By Nathan K Major";s:12:"atom_content";s:23440:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Well, I'm about to tell you, but before I do, a few points of things you won't see on my list: Any Hulk Hogan matches, I've only ever had the luxury of looking back at Hogan's career, but in my humble opinion, as much as I respect his drawing power, I really don't like his matches, sorry. You also won't see Bret Hart matches, his matches are good, they just don't rank among my favourites, even though I enjoy them. You'll also notice that I have very varied tastes in wrestling, enough talk let's list. </span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Honourable Mentions:</b></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Triple H vs The Undertaker (WWE Wrestlemania 28)</b></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Most people tend to only remember Undertaker's matches against Shawn Michaels a few years previous, what people tend to forget is how solid his matches with Triple H at 'Mania 27 and 28, their match at Wrestlemania 27 was a No Holds Barred match, with a great finish, but the Wrestlemania 28 match was a great story in itself, Billed as 'The End of An Era' and had Shawn Michaels as the special guest ref, the match itself was great, and the end visual, 'Taker, Triple H and Shawn Michaels supporting each other at the top of the ramp.

Ishii was already one of my favourite current wrestlers  going into this match in London, and even more so afterwards, this  was, I make no exaggeration, bloody brutal. Two guys seeing how hard  they can elbow each other before one of them dies, or passes out,  that sounds less violent. Throughout the match, a story was built  that Ishii wouldn't stay down, Hero would give him his most vicious  elbows, and Ishii would spring straight back up, shaken but not out,  it took a spinning forearm and a Gotch-style pile-driver to put away  the angry Japanese pit-bull. Also, an elbow Hero gave Ishii gave him  a massive purple bruise, I saw it in person, believe me it looked  horrible, Ishii's HEAD did that. Unbelievable.</span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><ol start="9"><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Cactus Jack vs Triple H (WWE  Royal Rumble 2000)</b></span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><ol start="10"><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </div></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><ol start="9"><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I told you Mick Foley would  appear again. So let's take you back to the start of 2000, Mick  Foley was burnt out, and ready to retire, but not without one last  main event run, bringing back his deranged Cactus Jack character to  face Triple H in this street fight at the Rumble. First off the  finish was Jolly old Saint Mick taking a pedigree onto thumb tacks,  that's FACE FIRST onto sharp tacks. Prior to that, was a good 20  minutes of mental brutality and story telling, run ins from the  Rock, a flaming barbed wire bat and blood, and at the end of the  match, Mick had made Triple H look like an even bigger star, as  Foley had a habit of doing.</span></span></div></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><ol start="8"><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>CM Punk vs Austin Aries (ROH  Death Before Dishonor III)</b></span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 1.19cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The match that kicked off the first (and best) 'Summer of Punk' storyline. The story goes that Punk was going to WWE and leaving his home of Ring of Honor and the fans were ready to give him a great send off, he was competing in a ROH World Title match on his way out, so Punk was gonna lose right? Ha. No. This is Gabe Spolsky era ROH, he had a better idea. The two had a great match, and to the surprise of pretty much everyone, Punk pinned Aries with a Pepsi Plunge and the crowd lost their damn minds, after that Punk cut a promo that turned him heel and started, and I'm serious, the best story any wrestling company outside WWE has told, and this was the catalyst for that, also the match itself was great.</span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><ol start="7"><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>John Cena vs AJ Styles  (Royal Rumble 2017)</b></span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">After a career of wowing people  wherever he went 'The Phenomenal One' finally arrived in WWE, and  had one of the best first years in the company and on his one year  anniversary he put on this stormer with John Cena. Prior to this,  Styles owned two pin-fall victories over Cena, albeit with one  screwy one. I was going to put their Summerslam 2016 match on here,  but to me this one topped it, it's not very often that Cena comes in  as somewhat of an underdog, and the story was hot, Cena hadn't  beaten Styles, and he was chasing a record tying 16<sup>th</sup> World Title, and they had impossible levels of chemistry, no matter  how much you criticise Cena, there's no denying that he pulls out  the best main event matches of the last decade, and having Styles in  the ring certainly doesn't hurt, it was in a word, amazing. And even  though Styles lost. He looked damn strong doing it and Cena cemented  his status as one of the greatest of all time.</span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <b>&nbsp;</b></span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>6.

Three teams that had revolutionised  tag team wrestling with the Triangle ladder match and the first TLC  match, The Dudley's, Edge and Christian and the Hardy's walked into  Wrestlemania X-7 with the goal of stealing the show, and walked out  having contested a Wrestlemania classic, featuring death defying  leaps and bumps, including Edge's now iconic spear on the dangling  Jeff Hardy, creating an image that will live on in video packages  for years to come.</span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><ol start="5"><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Kenny Omega vs Kazuchika  Okada (Wrestle Kingdom 11)</b></span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 1.22cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Everything that can be said about this match has already been said, within two days of it's occurrence it was being heralded as one of, if not the, greatest matches of all time. And it's a testament to these two men's work-rate to keep an entire world of wrestling fans on the edge of their seats. I like to think I've seen the bulk of things that can happen in wrestling and therefore, can be seen as a bit jaded, however, this match was the first time in a long time to have me on the edge of my seat through pretty much the entire match, not only did it tell an outstanding story over close to 50 minutes, and included things previously not usually seen in New Japan, like a table spot and a dive into the commentary area. Just when you thought this match was coming to an end, they hit the acceleration pedal again only to masterfully slow it down to a thrilling conclusion, maybe after further viewings it might make it's way further up the rankings.</span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><ol start="4"><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Tomohiro Ishii vs Katsoyuri  Shibata (Wrestle Kingdom 10)</b></span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> &nbsp;</span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Probably my most 'hipster'  entrant in this list, however, strong style is just what I like, and  it was not personified better in years than in this match, two of  the biggest hitters in Japan not standing down from the fight at  all, at one point head-butting each other head to head, and knowing  how hard Ishii's head is, it's either really brave or really stupid  of Shibata, also at one point both men took turns sitting down and  kicking each other as hard as they can. This match is exactly the  style of 'something different' that I love, in the same way I loved  Hero vs Ishii, except multiplied by 1000 given who Ishii was in  there with this time. Two of my favourites right now, making the  most of the big stage, great stuff.</span></span></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </div><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>3.

It was Wrestlemania weekend and one of Japan's biggest stars was  landing in NXT, and standing across the way was one of NXT's mister  reliable s, someone who'd help take NXT to where it was, Sami Zayn,  what followed was an absolute wrestling clinic. The pace was  blistering from the opening bell, Nakamura brought both his out of  the world charisma and outstanding in-ring ability and mixed it with  Zayn's considerable talents to create something truly special.  Seeing the Boma Ye (now Kinshasa) in WWE was special for those who  had seen Nakamura in Japan, as was seeing him bring his personality,  unchanged and wholesale over to America and not losing his step for  a second, he mesmerised the audience from the second he stepped in  the arena, and built a five star classic that levels any match in  wrestling history, and it was ALMOST my number one, but only one  match could be number one for me...</span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><ol><li><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>CM Punk vs John Cena (WWE  Money in the Bank 2011)</b></span></span></div></li></ol><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><div align="LEFT" class="gmail-western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 1.22cm;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I could only, in my heart of hearts, pick one match to rank at number one here. Sometimes a hot crowd can make a good match great, and in this matches case it took a great match and made it a legitimate 5-star classic. Coupled with the white hot story of Punk's contract being up, in front of Punk's home-town crowd giving the best atmosphere for a match in not just recent memory but possibly ever. CM Punk and John Cena had a special chemistry, in that, they seemed like they couldn't possibly have a bad match, but they both hit their peak here, with Cena in particular going out of his way to make Punk look every inch the star that he is, everything about this match was perfect, the story telling in the match, the big moments, the finish and Punk blowing that kiss goodbye to McMahon, it was all as close to perfect as it's possible to get it seems. This is truly a match that will live in wrestling memory, and also as my favourite match of all time.</span></span></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:185:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/6016911107427156018/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/03/my-top-10-matches-of-all-time-by-nathan.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/6016911107427156018";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/6016911107427156018";s:4:"link";s:91:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/03/my-top-10-matches-of-all-time-by-nathan.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:16;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-3438513029432103781";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-02-18T03:11:00.001-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-02-18T03:11:38.422-08:00";s:5:"title";s:55:"WWE 'Best PPV Matches 2016' DVD Review By Tim Ricketts.";s:12:"atom_content";s:62304:"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>  <o:AllowPNG/> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings></xml><![endif]--><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x9OQ08mTq90/WKgobsmQoFI/AAAAAAAAE44/79od_1Wf_94i1g8SpcDwNPeB5ri-yM-8QCEw/s1600/PPV%2BDVD.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x9OQ08mTq90/WKgobsmQoFI/AAAAAAAAE44/79od_1Wf_94i1g8SpcDwNPeB5ri-yM-8QCEw/s320/PPV%2BDVD.jpg" width="242" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Best Pay-per-View Matches compilation is often one of</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u> </u>the most worth-while DVD sets to pick up, offering up an interesting selection</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> that chronicles the year, barring Survivor series onwards presumably for</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> production reasons.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This year's iteration is presented by Lita, and whilst I normally enjoy her role as a talking head on the WWE Network, this one did not suit her talents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her reading of an autocue was obvious, with noticeable micro-pauses that left her sounding (and often looking) slightly uncomfortable.

</span>Shane-o-Mac rolled back the years to take one of those ultra-high dives that made him so famous, but other than that, these two competitors past their prime proved they can still put on a brutal bout in the WWE's famous steel structure.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

</span>For those not familiar with Steen versus Generico, thankfully WWE brings Owens versus Zayn with a barnstorming encounter from Payback in May.<span>&nbsp; </span>Highlights follow, with a subsequent rematch of the Payback main event, this time an Extreme Rules bout from the Extreme Rules event.<span>&nbsp; </span>Roman retained his championship against the on-fire AJ Styles; but with both having a point to prove about being on the top of the card, what started as a promising anything-goes brawl ended up interference-laden as first The Club, then The Usos appear.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

</span>Ladder Matches with this many competitors are often fast-paced frenetic things and this captured that to a tee, with plenty of early ringside action. The zenith of this match came when all six men were battling atop two ladders, dropping one by one until only Ambrose and Owens were left, the former SHIELD man grabbing the Canadian through the top rungs and smashing him unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taking the briefcase and the opportunity, Dean Ambrose also adds a new potential threat to the main event, conveniently next on this DVD.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgMNhXmYX7w/WKgrJ9uUc0I/AAAAAAAAE5Q/OkET9pTiMWEoUjZ5mEJnOpoju4nwc-55ACLcB/s1600/MITB.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="177" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgMNhXmYX7w/WKgrJ9uUc0I/AAAAAAAAE5Q/OkET9pTiMWEoUjZ5mEJnOpoju4nwc-55ACLcB/s320/MITB.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Action from The Crazy MITB Match</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Seth Rollins, back from injury and determined to regain the belt he was stripped of, had Reigns firmly in his sights. Roman had other ideas; even if he had given up trying to win over the still largely hostile WWE Universe, he needed to prove that he actually is 'the Guy' by putting away this particular personal demon.<span>&nbsp; </span>He started the match with methodical control, making every strike, kick and manoeuvre as hard as possible, Rollins only retaliating occasionally on the counter.<span>&nbsp; </span>The brutalised Architect finally established himself on to the match with some high-flying action from the turnbuckle to remind his former SHIELD team-mate why he had been champ too. Back in the ring, after some ringside brawling, Roman went for the Spear. Mid-air, the staggered Seth reacted instinctively to turn it into a Pedigree. One repetition on Roman was enough to get the pin, vindication and the Title.<span>&nbsp; </span>This story wasn't over yet though.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dean Ambrose's music hit, as did the MitB briefcase with Rollins' head, and all it took for us to have our third WWE Champion of the evening was one sweetly struck Dirty Deeds!</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Brand Split between RAW and SmackDown changed the layout of WWE before the next PPV, Battleground, and so the drafting of Superstars and titles came to the forefront.<br /><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The overwhelming sense of anticipation for the next bout lay in Sasha Banks' unknown teammate to face Charlotte and Dana Brooke, so when the music of the un-drafted, former NXT Women's Champion Bayley hit, the pop from the crowd was enormous.<span>&nbsp; </span>The match itself was an opportunity to advance Charlotte and Banks' feud and introduce Bayley to the wider WWE Universe rather than any great technical exposition, compared to other Women's matches in this set.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Following up on the WWE Championship storyline, we have a No-DQ Triple-Threat match.<span>&nbsp; </span>If either challenger dethrones SmackDown's Dean Ambrose, the historic title will be heading to RAW instead. The match was fast-paced and balanced, Ambrose brawling well, Rollins stunning with his high-flying athleticism and Reigns, back from a 30-day 'Wellness' suspension, taking out his obvious frustration with explosive power; all demonstrating the complementary styles that made them such a great team.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was Ambrose however, biding his time whilst recovering ringside, that took advantage of Reigns wiping out Seth with a Spear to employ his own Dirty Deeds and get the 3-count.<span>&nbsp; </span>Fantastically well executed Triple-threat that delivered a lot of uncertainty and suspense with the fast and brutal action.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">'Big Match John' versus AJ Styles at SummerSlam is probably my main-roster match of the year, so an excellent choice to start Disc three. Both athletes pulled out their extensive arsenals immediately, although each was countered into another then back into yet more.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can't crack out the big guns early without it taking its toll, but these two kept picking themselves up and increasing the calibre. A springboard Frankensteiner from Styles couldn't keep Cena's shoulders down, but neither could the return Super-AA floor Styles.<span>&nbsp; </span>It finally took a combination of finishers, a Clash followed by the Phenomenal Forearm to put pay to John Cena, a fair and square pinfall.<span>&nbsp; </span>Distraught and despondent, Cena left his 'Never Give Up' sweatband on the canvas before following the victorious Styles up the ramp.<span>&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the spiralling knife-edge one-upmanship makes this match a modern classic.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Next up we get to see WWE's inaugural Universal title holder. With the necessity of crowning the champion buy either pinfall or submission, it effectively makes the match no disqualification. Finn Balor, the demon king who battled his way past the cream of the RAW roster to earn his opportunity, started aggressively. Seth Rollins, the number one draft pick and automatic Challenger, responded with athletic resilience and powerful offence. A sickening blow to Balor's shoulder from Seth Rollins' bomb to the Barricades slowed him momentarily, and would prove to be significant in the coming days.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2yJBMjulng/WKgrq0saacI/AAAAAAAAE5Y/kRjMpOjgUo4oFRhyemKIqfhTBKoeMNnDACLcB/s1600/Balor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2yJBMjulng/WKgrq0saacI/AAAAAAAAE5Y/kRjMpOjgUo4oFRhyemKIqfhTBKoeMNnDACLcB/s320/Balor.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Finn Balor vs Seth Rollins From Summer Slam</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They traded increasingly powerful manoeuvres, frustration and exhaustion building, until Finn unleashed another volley of feet which culminated in his <i>coup de gras</i> double-foot stomp.

Say what you want about the current product lacking a certain something, but I think we're spoiled when it comes to in-ring talent. The mid-card is filled with talented wrestlers, while others wait in the wings in NXT. The main glaring difference from the Attitude Era to now however, is this: The treatment of women.<br /><br />Now, I may not be the best qualified person to speak of the injustices women face each day for daring to be different and in charge of themselves, but I am a big believer in Equality for all, and if that means I'm called a feminist then so be it, as if such a thing would be an insult. Besides, I don't tread on this sensitive topic alone, as I'm assisted on this look through history by Christy from @wrestlingsexism who is the fountain of knowledge and wisdom one needs in these situations (you can also check out Christy's blog here: www.wrestlingsexism.blogspot.nl)<br /><br />Way back when, your only exposure to women in the wrestling world was WWE, and it's questionable, at best, portrayal of women, yes they had a title, but it seemed like they couldn't be on screen without Jerry Lawler (don't get me started) yelling: ?Puppies!? or something along those lines, and matches would consist of slapping, hair-pulling or spanking, because women, am I right lads? The women would be paraded around in various costumes like dress your own love dolls and not one of them was treat like you know, a human being with thoughts and emotions, no, to the WWE they were just bimbo's, in the tightest costume their seamstress could make.<br /><br />And then there was the piece de resistance, the Bra and Panties match, can you imagine any other workplace where this would happen? Imagine for a moment you work in an office and your boss tells Sandra from accounts that she has to work in her underwear the next day, there'd be uproar! Recently Sasha Banks came out and mentioned this on RAW, and how women had evolved, this caused former writer Vince Russo to critisise Banks' as according to Russo they 'drew money' was this justification for having these matches? Christy thinks not: ?No, absolutely not. That shows you consider money more important than respecting women and treating them like human beings.?<br /><br />You're probably now thinking: ?It wasn't all bad, what about Trish Stratus and Lita?? Ah yes, Lita, let's explore her background shall we? The first thing that springs to mind is her story with Kane and Gene Snitsky, anyone remember that little chestnut? Of course you do, it was that time that WWE thought that a miscarriage was a great story. Long story short, Kane forcibly marries Lita, oh did I forget to mention that he WON Lita's marriage? Yes, won as if she was a prize, anyhow, Lita eventually comes round to married life and they conceive a Demon baby, until one fateful night Snitsky hits Kane with a chair and he falls on his pregnant wife. Ugh. This makes me uncomfortable just typing about it. Snitsky would go on to say: ?It wasn't his fault? and punt a baby doll into the crowd, Lita however would go without getting comeuppance, I assume because WWE just saw her as a prop that can be used and then forgotten about.<br /><br />That wasn't all that poor Lita had to put up with though. In 2005 Lita had an affair with Edge, while she was in a relationship with Matt Hardy, an affair that went public online and got Matt fired for airing his dirty laundry in public. Obviously to cheat on someone is an awful thing to do, but she wasn't the first person to do it, and why for the rest of her run was she seen as somewhat of a 'whore' while Edge's 'Rated R Superstar' gimmick was supposed to be positive, he went on to be an 11 time World Champion and his retirement was met with emotion and a celebration of his career. Lita? Not so much. ?When she retired from WWE, after years of putting her body on the line and being disrespected by fans and WWE alike, her send-off was being mocked and abused by Cryme Tyme. This was WWE's way of thanking one of their best and most popular women's wrestlers ever. With abuse and disrespect. And that just solidified my belief that WWE doesn't respect women. It had me in tears.? says Christy. The WWE thought it appropriate to send Lita off, by having Cryme Time (don't even mention the racial undertones of THAT gimmick) sell her panties to the audience. Yikes WWE, way to have tact, you afforded Trish a great send-off less than a year earlier, why do this to Lita?<br /><br />It isn't even the more modern crowd that can land on the wrong side of offensive when it comes to women wrestling, the older guys, with their old school views unsurprisingly land themselves on the wrong side of internet debate, for instance, the always controversial Jim Cornette recently stated that it was 'unconvincing' for women to wrestle men as well as insinuating that women were weaker than men and this would be why, what does our sexism consultant Christy have to say about this? ?I find it silly. Mostly because wrestling is, sorry to say, 'fake' and we're happy to accept smaller guys beating huge, big, tough guys, yet women beating men is a bridge too far? If it's written well, anything can be believable. If you start judging on what you think is believable, then you need to do this for all wrestlers and limit interaction between those in different weight classes, etc. Not just the women. You need to write it well, but that's the case for everything.?<br /><br />It seems someone else disagrees with you there Corny. Even if you think about it though we shouldn't need to be told this, there are certain people who could beat the crap out of you no matter whether they were a man or a woman, would you say that Ronda Rousey or Amanda Nunes couldn't beat up say someone like, Kofi Kingston? Even in the wrestling world, would you tell Awesome Kong that she was weaker than you because she's a woman, if you would you're braver, or stupider than I. <br />Cornette however, doesn't take issue with Women's Wrestling, there are some old guys who are, take for instance, Greg Valentine, who a few years back said that women should be, and I quote: ?Women should be at home, cooking, barefoot and pregnant.? Wow Greg wait to enter the 21st Century. What does Christy think? ?He clearly doesn't belong in this century and I refuse to give his ancient, ridiculous opinions any serious thought. I don't have the energy to deal with men like that, really.? Not an entirely surprising response, but in all honesty what did he expect people to think? Did he expect society to see the ill of it's ways and set itself back another century or two? At what point does a wrestler, and not a very interesting one at that, think that it';s justifiable to say stuff like that?<br /><br />Anyway, at least we're through the woods now right? Right? Well, not quite. While presentation of women has come on leaps and bounds in recent years, we still have some ways to go, take for example the recent Enzo Amore/Big Cass feud with Rusev and Lana. Don't get me wrong I like Enzo, he's a charismatic guy, I don't like what he's had written for him, the sort of half-sexual misogynistic comments that somehow make him a face, yet make Lana and Rusev heels because they're 'foreign'. ?I have much more of an issue with the way Lana was treated there than Rusev. WWE seems to like writing their faces attack the heel's wife/girlfriend while feuding with the heel and it's so unnecessary. And almost all of these women only went through this for the sake of a man's storyline. It's not even their story. They don't come out the hero, or the victor. They facilitate a man's evolution. As if they're props. Just as Lana was the prop used for Enzo to feud with Rusev. Just as Eve was used for Kane and Cena to feud. To make Cena a bigger hero who could 'save the damsel'. That whole Enzo/Lana/Rusev angle still makes me angry.? More strong comments there from Christy, There's much to think about in this feud, and it just seems like women are given these sort of storylines by a writing staff and upper management made up of: ?Mostly white, straight, middle-aged yes-men.? As Christy put it to me, this seems to be a problem widespread in all media that women aren't well written because they're frequently not written by women either.<br /><br />Still, no-one can deny the progress made in-ring in the last few years, we've seen women headline PPVs, and weekly TV broadcasts, participate in matches that were previously for the men only, we've seen the hideously outdated term 'diva' phased out and the Women's Championship reinstated. ?I'm not sure how much of it is willing and what is forced by society, but they treat their women so, so much better. Fewer degrading matches, more time given, more distinct characters and better chances to have excellent matches.? Says Christy of recent developments, but where do we go from here? Well I'd say the first big step should be more women in positions of power and creative (who don't have the surname McMahon) and the lessening of use of degrading relationship stories, I'd say that'd be the first step in a bold new direction.<br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:182:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/1767461553722194054/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/02/a-womans-world-evolution-of-womens_8.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/1767461553722194054";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/1767461553722194054";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2017/02/a-womans-world-evolution-of-womens_8.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:18;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-5465225162786187088";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-01-10T14:53:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-01-10T14:53:57.417-08:00";s:5:"title";s:61:"The Top 5 Rematches That Need To Happen in 2017 By Tony Quant";s:12:"atom_content";s:9417:"<div id="AOLMsgPart_2_0ebdb283-2404-47c5-8c08-96cb56523f3f"><div class="aolReplacedBody" style="-webkit-line-break: after-white-space; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; word-wrap: break-word;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZxeEFEkIiTc/WHVkzKfTlJI/AAAAAAAAE38/Y4GtIG4cD64WdKzWKqWoYw53P8zzYTCqgCEw/s1600/DIY.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZxeEFEkIiTc/WHVkzKfTlJI/AAAAAAAAE38/Y4GtIG4cD64WdKzWKqWoYw53P8zzYTCqgCEw/s320/DIY.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;Rematches  in any sport are always tricky to predict. Inside the squared circle  the outcome is not so much the issue, more the quality that the fans can  expect from the bout. After all, there is a reason that the original  contest is considered a classic match leaving fans desperate for more.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">That  first match took the fans on an emotional roller coaster that allowed  them to fully commit and invest themselves into that match. The rematch  therefore is often looked upon with cautious eyes, fearful that the  second installment will not be able to live up to its original self.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">Looking  at the history books, the reality is that rematches in wrestling don't  usually live up to the hype and expectations that were set by the  original. Whether that is down to the ageing of the performers, the  pressure on duplicating an excellent first encounter or just the  performers not caring as much is all open to interpretation.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">But  whilst the history doesn't defend rematches, there are some golden  nuggets which were most certainly better second time around. Bret Hart vs Mr Perfect at the 1993 King of the Ring, Bret Hart vs Steve Austin at  WrestleMania 13 and John Cena vs The Rock from WrestleMania 29 to name  just a few.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">Whilst  2016 will largely be remembered for one particular rematch, Lesnar vs  Goldberg, fans across the globe were treated to a number of incredible  matches and here are five of them that we want/need to see duplicated as  we head into 2017.</span></div><div class=""><b><span class=""><br class="" /></span></b></div><div class=""><b><span class="">5. The Revival vs DIY</span></b></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">The  Revival and DIY (Sorry but this name just doesn?t do anything for me)  tore the roof down when they competed in a two out of three falls match  at NXT Takeover Toronto. It was without a doubt the true highlight of  the weekend for many wrestling fans across the globe and whilst The  Revival dropped the Tag Titles in the match, argument could be had that  their contribution to the match took it up a few notches. Dawson and  Wilder desperately forcing each other not to tap out at the end of the  bout is an image that will stay with wrestling fans for a long time.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">But  why should we care for a rematch that we have seen on numerous  occasions? Well because every time the four have come together we have  been treated to something quite spectacular. Both teams could slot right  in on the main roster and with a lack of depth in strong tag teams 2017  could be a great opportunity for both teams. The Revival in particular  stand a great chance of making the main roster due to the lack of top  heel tag teams and a run with DIY later on in 2017 is all that the  promotion would need to push forward the Tag Team division under either  brand.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><b><span class="">4. Young Bucks vs The Hardy Boys</span></b></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">The  Young Bucks vs The Hardy Boyz initial match may not go down in history  as one of the best tag matches ever, however, there is a method to this  madness which means that we truly must see these four go at it again in  2017. The initial match was littered with the expected array of  Superkicks, Twist of Fates and Indytaker?s but the phenomenal character  of ?Broken? Matt Hardy was very much absent from this ?Dream Tag Match.?</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">Fast  forward to 2017 and the ground work has already been laid for the  foursome to put on a true wrestling spectacle. That is everything we  wish for, a spectacle. We know that it won?t be the most technically  sound match we could see but the air of mystery makes it an even more  attractive proposal. Matt Hardy?s character is one of the hottest things  on the independent scene and having called out ?The Bucks of Youth? on  numerous occasions it surely has to be just a matter of time before  these four are back within a squared circle/eight sided ring giving the  fans just what they need.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><b><span class="">3. Nakamura vs AJ Styles</span></b></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">Nakamura vs AJ Styles from Wrestle Kingdom 10 was simply phenomenal (That?s  once). The co-main event of the biggest NJPW show of the year and these  two men left absolutely everything in ring, lets not forget Styles had a  back injury going into this one. This match had absolutely everything  from drama, to near counts to the classic heel vs face tactics that left  us begging for more.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">Moving  onto 2017 and we simply must be treated to this phenomenal (That?s  twice) encounter again, this time on the grandest stage of them all. Ok  right I get we won?t see it at Mania but stay with me. It simply has to  be a matter of time before Nakamura joins the main WWE roster and if  they truly intend to carry on with his mysterious, charismatic ways then  they need to put him in there with the right dance partner. No dance  partner is better suited to him that AJ Styles on the main roster which  is why we have to see these two get at it again, hopefully in 2017.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><b><span class="">2. Chris Hero vs Ishii</span></b></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">The  initial match which took place during the Revolution Pro Global Wars  shows was such beautiful, unadulterated violence that truly needs to be  seen to be believed. Chris Hero and Tomohiro Ishii literally tore the  roof off of York Hall en route to four and a half of Dave Meltzer?s  finest stars. Without the need for a gimmick or Title belt to add to the  hype of this match, the hard hitting duo proved that pure talent will  always shine through and capture a crowd.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">The  sheer brilliance of seeing a match like this take place again is more  than enough justification for seeing these two go at it again. But with  the rumours of Hero signing with the WWE it may be too little too late  for us to witness such an intense battle between two veterans of the  independent wrestling scene. But what better swan song than a rematch  with Ishii anywhere in the World to give Chris a Hero?s (C?mon you got  to give me that one) send off on his way to pastures new.</span></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><b><span class="">1. Ospreay vs Ricochet</span></b></div><div class=""><span class=""><br class="" /></span></div><div class=""><span class="">If  there is one thing that 2016 taught us, it?s that ?Flippy poop? is just  like marmite and you either love it or hate it. It takes something  special to get the Korakuen Hall audience chanting ?This is awesome? and  ?One more match?, something Will Ospreay and Ricochet achieved back in  May.

Whilst Raven may  have won the belt on more occasions than anyone else, it was Steve  Blackman who was the longest holder of the belt with a total reign of  172 days.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">This  series will focus purely on the Title matches of the WWF/WWE Hardcore  Championship and will start back on November 2nd. On a weekly basis we  will review the following Title change and give you a complete overview  of the Championship match. We hope that you will enjoy reading it as  much as we have enjoyed reviewing the WWE Vault (OK we don?t have a  vault we just have the network like you guys)!</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">So  without further ado here is the first entry in the Hardcore Diaries  which start with Vince McMahon presenting Mankind with the belt.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><b>November 2nd, 1998 - Raw Is War Houston, Texas</b></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">We  move over to a backstage segment which includes Vince McMahon, The Big  Boss Man and Mankind. Vince is in a wheelchair and is sitting opposite  Mankind. Vince pleads with Mankind not to interfere in the next match  which is between Ken Shamrock and The Rock. Vince tells Mankind he has a  present for Mankind but will only give it to him if he promises not to  get involved.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Mankind  duly agrees to Vince?s request and Vince presents Mankind with the new  WWF Hardcore Championship Belt. Mankind tells Vince that he ?loves it?  and Vince says to Mankind ?in some respects I feel like I have lost a  son tonight. But maybe I have gained another.? As Vince starts to wheel  himself out of the room, Mankind replies ?Jeez, thanks Dad.? Vince  leaves the room with a bewildered look on his face.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Conclusion  - No action to report but it is definitely fitting that the first ever  WWF Hardcore Champion is Mankind. His history in hardcore matches speaks  for itself and I can see the WWF thinking that his willingness to take  bumps in these kind of matches will bring something extra to Raw and  create a niche. Its definitely interesting to see them going the  ?Hardcore? route but having just overtaken Nitro in the head to head  ratings the needed to keep momentum and viewership on their side.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><b>Part 2&nbsp;</b></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><b>November 2nd, 1998 - Raw Is War Baltimore, Maryland</b></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">The Hardcore Championship is on the line under Ladder match rules between the Champion Mankind and The Big Boss Man.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">The  challenger the Big Boss Man comes to the ring accompanied by the WWF  Commissioner Shawn Michaels. Mankind comes out with the J.O.B squad who  are quickly sent backstage which seems bizarre? Bossman attacks with a  night stick on the outside of the ring and Shawn joins Jim Ross and  Jerry Lawler on commentary.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Mankind  slams the Boss Man head first into the steel steps then fetches a  ladder and throws it directly in Boss Man?s face. Shawn on commentary  slams Mankind saying he has ?been there and done that. He can?t wrestle  for 45 minutes like me.? Mankind continues to beat Boss Man with the  ladder outside the ring. Mankind finally gets into the ring and  sandwiches Boss Man in the ladder and drops an elbow on him.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">In  one of his only offensive moves since the start of the match Boss Man  tries a sloppy Irish whip but ends up getting double DDT?d for his  efforts. Shawn tells Mankind to ?drag that fat butt up that ladder? this  is vintage Shawn on the commentary.&nbsp; Boss Man pulls Mankind off the  ladder and sets it up in the corner, follows it up by tossing Mankind  into it.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Both  men finally made their way to the top of ladder and Bossman gets his  finger tips on the Title. Mankind hits him a few times and gives him a  mandible claw on the ladder. Bossman falls down but is able to get back  up to stop Mankind getting the gold. Out of nowhere The Rock appears and  pushes Mankind off the ladder onto the ropes. The crowd go absolutely  wild for The Rock?s interference which really is the highlight of the  match so far.</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Mankind  is able to get back up and after kicking The Rock in the nuts repeats  the same on the Boss Man. After getting back up the ladder The Rock  pulls Mankind down and gives him a Rock Bottom. Boss Man lays some boots  on Mankind before climbing the ladder and grabbing the belt to become  the new WWF Hardcore Champion.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">After  the match Boss Man hits Mankind with the night stick and Michaels and  The Rock lay some boots on him. The Corporation stand supreme.</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Conclusion  - Definitely not one of the finest Hardcore matches of all time,  largely in part due to Boss Man?s work which was lacklustre to say the  best. Mankind is more than at home in these hardcore matches and was  carrying the match throughout. The Corporation angle got over big and  the crowd where hot when The Rock got involved. Michaels was brilliant  on commentary playing off of the King?s set-ups.</div></div></div></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:183:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/2622907677486133318/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-wwf-hardcore-diaries-parts-1-2-by.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/2622907677486133318";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/2622907677486133318";s:4:"link";s:89:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-wwf-hardcore-diaries-parts-1-2-by.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:20;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444.post-8053776268157150745";s:9:"published";s:29:"2016-12-05T14:43:00.001-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2016-12-05T14:43:26.305-08:00";s:5:"title";s:65:"WWE The True Story Of The Royal Rumble DVD Review By Tim Ricketts";s:12:"atom_content";s:15627:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pEfHiL5qyjw/WEXqB9mIeAI/AAAAAAAAE3M/ebJUJVXO6j0Ip2BbF5LSX-U7YginMqHnwCLcB/s1600/RR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pEfHiL5qyjw/WEXqB9mIeAI/AAAAAAAAE3M/ebJUJVXO6j0Ip2BbF5LSX-U7YginMqHnwCLcB/s320/RR.jpg" width="292" /></a></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  True Story of The Royal Rumble takes the fan favourite Pay-per-view  event, and gives it the same historical documentary treatment as WWE did  with their WrestleMania and Starrcade DVDs. &nbsp;Now approaching it's  thirtieth iteration, The Rumble's unique structure means that never  fails to be entertaining or controversial. Either way, every year it is  must see Wrestling.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">This  look into the traditional start of the Road to Wrestlemania, consisting  of a traditional documentary DVD - with plenty of clips, highlights and  vox pops of Legends and SuperStars - and two discs of 'Special  Features' and Featured Matches, also delves into the setup and  surroundings of Royal Rumble 2016. To start the whole thing in context,  the progenitor of the concept - first Intercontinental Champion Pat  Patterson - describes how his refinement of the traditional  Over-the-top-rope Battle Royale to include timed entrances was presented  to NBC TV. &nbsp;At a time when a star's entrance was a relatively new and  effective addition to his gimmick, TV executive Dick Ebersol saw this as  the perfect feature for a (then) WWF special for his network. &nbsp;The  concept was refined at House Shows, and the first Televised version was  such a success that it became a permanent addition to the 'Big Four' of  Pay-per-Views.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">With  the first few years being treated as their own self-contained  tournament in the era of only a handful of annual PPVs, and the majority  of subsequent matches rewarding a main-event at Wrestlemania, winning  the Royal Rumble has always held a high level of prestige. &nbsp;More  talking-head segments of notable competitors relate this, as well as the  challenge and honour of either starting as number 1, 2, or 30 in  particular. &nbsp;All further tweaks and touches that has kept this as quite  probably the most popular annual show outside of Wrestlemania.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  Rumble has had it's own fair share of controversies over the years,  which is only to be expected from such a long-running concept, and this  DVD does not shy away. &nbsp;The only time the Rumble has settled the  Championship prior to this year, Ric Flair's win in '93, came about as  the result of contentious matches between Hogan and Undertaker. &nbsp;Bret  Hart and Lex Luger having to share the 'victory' in '94, Shawn Michaels'  single foot on the floor prior to his win in 1995, BOTH of The Rock's  feet touching in 2000, and the Quad-busting mutual elimination of Cena  and Batista, all dally with iffy eliminations. &nbsp;The fans' reactions to  the 2014 &amp; 15 events, and their Daniel Bryan-related  disappointments, are covered with revealing backstage footage which  paints Reigns in a very sympathetic light.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">If  there is one single thing in the anticipation of a rumble that builds  fan interest, it is the surprise entrants, the Superstars that you don't  expect to see. &nbsp;This year's event has AJ Styles making his debut and  the backstage secrecy this involves, whilst seeing the Legends of days  gone making a cameo - from The Honky Tonk Man to DDP - gets a great pop  from 'the Universe'. &nbsp;Add to this the stealthy returns from injury over  the years, of the likes of Edge or John Cena, and there is always a  shock or two amongst the 30 men selected. Although the documentary has a  chapter dedicated to this phenomenon, the number of significant  inclusions over the years could have seen it expanded somewhat.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  Royal Rumble match itself isn't the only reason to pay attention to  this PPV, the Undercard has it's historic gems too. In particular, the  Rumble 2000 gets it's due recognition with the first Tag-team Tables  match in WWE between the Dudley Boyz and Hardy Boyz, Tazz's début suplex  battle with Kurt Angle and Cactus Jack &amp; HHH in hardcore heaven. &nbsp;A  look at Rowdy Roddy Piper's Intercontinental reign that began at the  Rumble kicks off a look at that title's storied history at this event,  leading right up to this year's brutal slug-fest between Kevin Owens and  Dean Ambrose. &nbsp;In a moment of candid remorse, Scott Hall (Razor Ramon)  talks regretfully about his reaction to the homoeroticism in his match  with Goldust, 20 years ago.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  format of the Royal Rumble lends itself to the notion of statistical  Records, all there to be admired or beaten: from the Shortest time in  the ring (Santino Marella, 1sec) to the Longest (Rey Mysterio, entered  first &amp; won, 62mins+), Stone Cold holds the record for most wins  (with three). &nbsp;One man stands tall in the record books however, Kane  with Most Eliminations (42), Most Rumbles, and had held most  eliminations in a single match until he was beaten in 2015 (11-12) by  Roman Reigns. Reigns becomes the First to defend the WWE title in the  Rumble Match itself, as number one entrant no less. &nbsp;This segues nicely  into the 'Moments' chapter of the DVD as we see the start of the 2016  bout, and Styles vaunted debut at number three.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">Dedicating  itself to the more esoteric highlights of history, this chapter covers  such diverse topics as Too Cool &amp; Rikishi dancing mid match, Tough  Enough rookie Maven eliminating Undertaker, Demolition Fighting each  other and Andre the Giant being scared of Jake's snake. Chyna, as the  first female Royal Rumble entrant gets a significant mention, as does  Kofi Kingston's regular rumble acrobatic escapology act. As Shawn  Michaels and the Undertaker fight out their huge ending in '07, we get  taken forward in time to the ending of this year's as Reign's valiant  defence ends and Triple-H eliminates Ambrose to become 14-time Champion  at the same time as looking after his boardroom duties.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">At  only an hour and five minutes long, the Royal Rumble has had plenty of  history to provide more flesh to the bones of this documentary, but for  it's length it does cover all the important events, even if only  briefly. Still a worthy addition to any completists, collectors or fans  of the format like I am. &nbsp;Let's see how the other discs support or  complement the documentary.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  'Special Features' section of disc two would have been a lot of the  missing 'flesh' I mentioned. &nbsp;From interesting anecdotes, the star power  of Pamela Anderson in the mid-nineties, to Mae Young winning 'Miss  Rumble 2000' and a featurette on significantly less puerile female  appearances at the Rumble, this adds some value to the set. &nbsp;The  'Matches' section starts with the première Royal Rumble match from 1988,  which holds up very well for it's age and shows excellent construction  and progression throughout. &nbsp;The Rockers vs The Orient Express is a good  tag match and better technically, but Ultimate Warrior vs Sgt.  Slaughter - also from 1991 - feels the stronger historic inclusion.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s2" style="line-height: 13.199999809265137px;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">The  1994 'draw' between Bret Hart and Lex Luger is included in it's  entirety, whilst the 1997 Championship Match between Sycho Sid and Shawn  Michaels, as well as the aforementioned Tazz/Angle match from 2000,  round out the disc. &nbsp;The 2001 Rumble match, notable for the first  Celebrity entrant in comedian Drew Carey, the Hardy Boyz fighting each  other, the Return of the Honky Tonk Man and as Stone Cold's record  breaking third win, starts disc 3. The 2007 iteration ended with an  all-out bloody battle between Michaels and Undertaker and is the last  full rumble match on the set. &nbsp;The final two matches are the  surprisingly technical bout between The Rock and CM Punk from 2013 that  ended Punk's 434 day reign as Champion, and the fiery and contentious  Divas' Championship match from this year between Becky Lynch and  Charlotte.</span></span></div><div style="line-height: 21.600000381469727px;

font-size: 11.0pt;">Whether you know him as 'the Viper', 'the Apex Predator' or 'the Legend Killer', Randy Orton has been at the top of the wrestling food-chain for well over a decade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His uniquely capricious character and subtle charisma have established him as a man not to be reckoned with, or particularly trusted either, but it has kept him in the main event picture all those years; even if only as a dark horse for a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am utterly certain that I am talking about a future Hall-of-Famer here, and a definite Legend.</span> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">It has been five years since WWE released their last Orton DVD, and like a lot of the past releases of their more enduring Superstars it is due for an update.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cue 'Randy Orton: RKO Outta Nowhere' to fill this void.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>WWE's other updated biographies, like the recent Brock Lesnar one, have shied away from any repetition of matches from previous offerings, but with over a dozen WWE/World Championships behind Orton this should contain some quality viewing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A quick check through the contents of the three discs confirm that WWE are sticking by their current format of a chronological match compilation, interspersed with highlight packages and short interview-style segues, rather than a documentary followed by a match compilation.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">The set begins with Randy ruminating on his start in the business at WWE developmental territory OVW, being thankful for it being easier than most due to his family background as a third-generation wrestler. It quickly <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>moves on to his first 'dark' (or un-televised) match against Flash Flanagan which has no commentary for obvious reasons, but shows Orton's immense power and potential.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">Orton's career has paralleled that of John Cena in so many ways, and we slip back to OVW to see one of their first (of very many) encounters, after The Viper gives his early impressions of the then 'Prototype'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Orton also discusses how he was treated by senior figures whilst establishing himself on the main Roster, with highlights of his TV debut vs Hardcore Holly, and in particular how the Undertaker dealt with the (included) early championship match he was given.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Triple-H's run-in at the end leads us neatly to the formation of Evolution, the alliance of Orton, HHH, Ric Flair and Batista.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A 6-man elimination tag match against the Dudley Boyz provides a fantastic example of this most excellent faction.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">The next two matches highlight the beginnings of the 'Legend Killer' gimmick and Orton's substantial run as Intercontinental Champion, the longest for seven years, with a defence against 'Legend' Chris Jericho, and his championship rematch against Edge after finally losing the title at Vengeance. Despite this title run and the ascension to his first World Heavyweight Championship bringing prestige to Evolution, its permanent dissolution was inevitable once Triple-H revealed his jealousy of Orton's title. An un-televised match from their subsequent feud rounds out disc one, and adds some substantial rarity value as well as Randy's insights into working with the now WWE Chief.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">After talking about working against Edge earlier, Orton focuses on their tag-team, Rated-RKO, at the start of disc two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Their brief title-run is demonstrated with a match against the Hardys, before attention is switched to Randy's next WWE Championship reign with an absolute humdinger of a stipulation match with Shaun Michaels at Survivor Series '07.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is followed by the Champion vs Champion match against Jeff Hardy at the following Royal Rumble and then an incongruous four-year jump in time to 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was mildly disappointed that The Legacy, the faction that formed the bulk of his work during this time, has seemingly been airbrushed from Orton's history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Though, this may have more to do with Cody Rhodes' recent departure from the company than anything.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">Ignoring that gap, the Last Man Standing match with CM Punk at Extreme Rules is a beautiful example of pacing and psychology over spectacular 'spots'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Another Champion versus Champion match, this time against US title holder Dolph Ziggler who Orton refers to as a 'top three' talent, rounds out the second disc.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">If a four year jump is a bit much, then the third disc commences in contrast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The next match occurs only a day after the previous one against Ziggler, a feud-ending Steel Cage match<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>against Christian to retain his World Championship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Another jump, this time of just under two years, brings us into another period of dominance for the Apex Predator and a brief discussion about ladder matches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Money in the Bank Ladder Match 2013 is the platform from which this success launched, and is filled with the athletes that he has spent the intervening time feuding with.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">After using his MITB contract to win the WWE Championship, we get to the point of most historic significance on the entire set: The Unification Match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>WWE Champion Randy Orton met World Champion John Cena in a TLC match to become the final World, and new WWE World Heavyweight Champion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The two young titans of the 2000s give a showing worthy of the occasion, which is just as well with the establishment of the new Universal Championship virtually ruling out any resurrection of the Big Gold Belt in the New Era.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">After the significance of that match, the remaining three bouts may seem a little lacklustre, but the wrestling content is still watch-worthy, and significantly we get to hear Orton's opinions on the Superstars of Today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Randy obviously likes working against Dean Ambrose, considering the compliments he gives, and the intensity of the match shown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The intensity continues for the high-profile Wrestlemania XXXI fight with Seth Rollins, on his own steamroller course for the title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Probably the highest praise is reserved for Cesaro and his strength, and a spectacularly explosive triple threat between him, Orton and Kevin Owens concludes the DVD set.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt;">Whilst the gaps and total resistance to any repetition from any other sets makes this collection a little disjointed in terms of chronology, it is, quite appropriately, a beautifully coherent record of Randy's evolution, and well worth owning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>From The Legend Killer to Legend, from Rookie to Ring General, this set successfully documents Orton's legacy and The Viper's place as WWE's Apex Predator.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;droid sans&quot;;

</span>Once you get your head around the anachronistic cognitive dissonance of a 2015 set packaged as 'Annual 2016' when it's nearly 2017, then this is a potentially good time-capsule of an interesting transitional year for WWE.</span> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Droid Sans&quot;;">The TV show and PPV sets are presented by Byron Saxton and Corey Graves respectively, providing the necessary talking-head and segue sections to link the chronology of the highlight packages and matches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Talking of highlight packages, the match selections are heavily enhanced by them, with each Pay-per-View getting it's own, and the month's major happenings and débuts on TV are similarly summarised too.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Droid Sans&quot;;">To minimise any jumping backward and forward in time, I've viewed and reviewed the DVDs in pairs, starting with the first Best of RAW and SmackDown disc then The Best PPV Matches disc 1, and so forth alternating between the sets.

This match spawned the 'Suplex City' catchphrase with Lesnar's opening ringside threats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Seth Rollins finally cashes in his 'Money in the Bank' contract to interject himself late in the match to opportunistically steal the title with his 'fresh legs'.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white;"><span style="background-color: black;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Despite running wild on the following RAW when Rollins refused his re-match request, Brock finally gets his wish at Battleground in July, taking Rollins to the, now legendary, Suplex City (13 this time) before Undertaker gets some slight revenge for his Streak loss by costing The Beast the championship in interfering. It sets up one last match between the two historical foes, and this time it is Hell in a Cell. Notably, all three discs finish with Brock beating the Dead-man; however the fact that it is the Undertaker's own 'back yard' of The Cell that gives this a finality that the feud needed, and really underlines the dominance of Lesnar over an athlete that has consistently maintained his position at the top of the WWE Roster.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt;

SummerSlam 2016 from Brooklyn, New York ? in the wake of the company's second Brand Split.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>RAW has seen SmackDown Live draft both the WWE (World) Championship and Intercontinental, leaving it with only the US Title for male singles competition, so will be crowning the first WWE Universal Champion here in addition to the usual title bouts.</span> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Main Event is a showcase match however, between the returning Randy Orton versus Brock Lesnar fresh off his much-publicised UFC200 match and USADA infraction, which Orton has been using to cheekily taunt Lesnar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Notably, these Superstars of decade-plus standing have never met in a major match despite the parallels in their WWE careers.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The card also features the SmackDown ladies in 6-woman tag-team action, John Cena and AJ Styles continue their rivalry, with Enzo &amp; Big Cass tackling the burgeoning Canadian super-team of JeriKO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With 13 matches scheduled (over 2 discs) the action should come thick and fast for one of WWE's 'Big Four' events.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">After an intro filled with Big Apple iconography, and a highlight run-down through the upcoming matches, we get our first match:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Enzo Amore &amp; Big Cass vs. JeriKO (Chris Jericho &amp; Kevin Owens) [RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Enzo and Cass, being the excellent mic-men that they are, pick up on the New-York theme with a fantastic Sinatra-inspired familiar in-ring promo, the inevitable conclusion being that JeriKO are S.A.W.F.T!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I swear that the WWE haven't seen this level of catchphrase crowd interaction since the hey-day of the New Age Outlaws, superb stuff.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The match itself was showed why both teams should potentially worry the Champs, the New Day, Enzo &amp; Cass cementing their fan-favourite status with deadly double-teaming, Cass in particular a dominant threat with his size and strength, picking up his opponents and partner to use as projectile weapons over the ropes with consummate ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>JeriKO respond with guile and Machiavellian tactics, applying their nous and experience to test Enzo Amore's copious resilience by trapping him in their corner by any means necessary.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Brawls break out around the ring, leading to a devastating cannonball from Kevin Owens on Big Cass into the barricade, leaving Enzo stranded with JeriKO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>KO launches Amore air-bound, to land crashing into Chris's Codebreaker and prone for Jericho to pin. A nicely executed match to start the show and pump the viewer.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Sasha Banks (c) vs. Charlotte ? WWE Woman's Championship [RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">A quick highlight package of these athletes' heated feud, including Banks' recent championship win on RAW, is followed by some in-ring verbal sparring as the announcer is reading the billing. These aren't the only signs of how heated their rivalry has become, the opening minutes of the bout is fast ans frenetic with traded counters and pin attempts. That is right up to a nasty slip by Charlotte up high on the turnbuckles, dropping Sasha on the ropes which catapulted her to the mat head-first and uncontrolled, wrenching her back and neck in the impact.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">This noticeably changes the pace of the match, every stretch and backbreaker bringing a wince to my face as Charlotte takes advantage of the injury, grinding away at Banks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With Dana Brooke barred from ringside, this looks like a good substitute for the 'leveller' she's used to getting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It's not all one way traffic though, any opportunity Sasha Banks has she goes for the high impact, first countering a Razor's Edge from the cornerpost into a Frankensteiner, followed shortly after with flying double knees to the former champion's chest on the unforgiving ringside floor. It takes more out of her than it does Ms. Flair, Charlotte finally countering a Bank Statement submission into a pin to regain the Title and maintain her unbeaten singles PPV streak.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The legitimate looking injury added an extra layer of gruesome interest to this match, which still managed to be impressively athletic despite its sometimes necessarily stilted nature.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The followers of Japanese and independent wrestling are treated to a little inside joke vignette. AJ is having a chat with The Club 'doctors' backstage, when fellow former Bullet Club member Finn Balor stops by then walks away without acknowledging the teased 'Too Sweet' hand-gestures. Sure to raise as many eyebrows as it does smiles.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Miz (w/Maryse) (c) vs. Apollo Crews- WWE Intercontinental Championship [SD]</span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The slightly flat premise for this match is that five time and current Intercontinental champion, The Miz, is mixing up Apollo Crews for Apollo Creed, the Rocky film-franchise antagonist. Crews is understandably irked by this show of unrepentant unprofessionalism. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The Miz starts aggressively, pinning back the physically impressive Crews until he manages a pin attempt against the run of dominance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Miz tries an Axe-handle smash from the turnbuckle, but is met mid-air with a drop-kick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He counters one standing Moonsault, but succumbs to Apollo's second attempt to send him running scared for the entranceway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Crews is having none of it, drags the champ back to the ring, but gets distracted by Maryse as he enters the ropes. A fatal mistake, as one Skull-crushing Finale later, Miz has the pinfall victory to retain.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Quite frankly, a match that was as inspirational as the premise it was built on.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">John Cena vs. AJ Styles [SD]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">These two leading lights of SmackDown Live have been feuding for months, without definitive result, but the recent roster split has bereft Styles of his backup in the form of The Club, so this could be the match to put this rivalry to bed, considering they'll be tied up in the following bout.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The opening tie-up is pretty even, with Cena stronger and AJ quicker, but that isn't where the deadlock ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Both athletes pull out their extensive arsenals immediately, although each is countered into another then back into yet more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>An Attitude Adjustment is met with a Styles Clash or Suplex to the apron, while Styles' springboard attacks are countered into an STF or even an astonishing Canadian Destroyer-esque manoeuver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If that was Cena reaching deep into the weapons locker, then he did again moments later cracking out a Tornado DDT.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">You can't crack out the big guns early without it taking its toll, but these two kept picking themselves up and increasing the calibre. A springboard Frankensteiner from Styles couldn't keep Cena's shoulders down, but neither could the return Super-AA floor Styles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It finally took a combination of finishers, a Clash followed by the Phenomenal Forearm to put pay to John Cena, a fair and square pinfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Distraught and despondent, Cena leaves his 'Never Give Up' sweatband on the canvas before following the victorious Styles up the ramp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the spiralling knife-edge one-upmanship makes this match a modern classic.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The New Day (Xavier Woods &amp; Kofi Kingston w/Jon Stewart) (c) vs. The Club (Karl Anderson &amp; Luke Gallows) ? WWE Tag Team Championship [RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Before the teams come out, Jon Stewart comes to the ring and reveals himself to be standing in for Big E, due to his groinal incapacitation with 'Ringpostitis' caused by The Club, before introducing The New Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Club are still dressed as doctors when they enter, bearing specimen jars for all (now four) New Day members. Big E's jar contains two humorously over-sized spheres, whilst similarly Stewart's jar is hilariously small.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Xavier Woods gets an early pin attempt on Karl Anderson, his partner returning the favour before the match gets some double-team chaos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When semblance of order is restored, The Club keep Kofi Kingston away from a tag, before he gets a retaliatory strike against Luke Gallows to provoke a double hot-tag situation. Woods leaps three-quarters of the way across the ring to land a tightrope elbowdrop on Anderson.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">A follow-up Kingston pin attempt is broken up by Gallows to set up the Magic Killer double team move, but before the legal Club-man can get in a pin, Jon Stewart rushes the ring (despite his promises of non-interference) and draws their ire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cue a run-in from a returning Big E, to save Stewart from a bad case of Ringpostitis, and cause a DQ victory for The Club. A pretty average match, and the mix of New Day and Club antics are always likely to cause dubious finishes, as in this case.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Dean Ambrose (c) vs. Dolph Ziggler ? WWE World Championship [SD]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">A highlight video of Ziggler's notable successes and numerous frustrations lead us in to this match, but the real heat can be felt as the SmackDown management team of Daniel Bryan and Shane McMahon are needed to keep the two competitors separate before the bell.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="docs-internal-guid-b9f23e4b-a977-c42f-f5"></a><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Dolph uses the technical ability of his amateur background to good effect, whilst Ambrose resorts to his strong suit too <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and takes the match to ringside brawling. A Superplex from Ambrose gives him the space to slow the match, and grind Ziggler down on the mat. Ziggler responds with a sweet DDT and pulls off The Famouser on the second attempt to get Dean down for a two count.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Ambrose is constantly mocking Ziggler and has to drop down to ringside hard to break a retaliatory sleeper hold and gets a superkick for his troubles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With both athletes battered, they return to the ring. Ziggler performs his zig zag for a pin attempt, but another sleeper can't hold Ambrose down, and neither can a superplex, as Ambrose counters into the standing position to hit the Dirty Deeds and get the victorious pin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The match itself was definitely above average, but it didn't really feel worthy of being for this historic championship.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Becky Lynch, Naomi &amp; Carmella vs. Alexa Bliss, Natalya &amp; Nikki Bella [SD]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The 6 Woman tag team match featuring the SmackDown Live female roster starts with a few interesting entrances, including Naomi's excellent, rave-style Glow entrance, the billed Eva Marie being announced as on holiday in the British Isles (despite being laid off with a wellness suspension) and instead we're treated to Nikki Bella's comeback from a career-threatening neck injury.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The match itself is filled with the ladies cracking out their signature moves, to demonstrate their excellent skills, and quick tags.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Alexa Bliss is by far the smallest athlete but makes up for it by having the biggest aggressive attitude, whilst Nikki Bella seems determined to take out her pent up aggression on Carmella. Not even Becky Lynch taking on all three opponents can save her from the inevitable once she finds herself back in the ring with The Bella Twin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A pin from the recovered Bella puts the icing on a fun and fast exhibition tag match.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">'The Demon King' Finn Balor vs. Seth Rollins ? WWE Universal Championship [RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Next up we get to see who is WWE's inaugural universal title holder and with the necessity of crowning the champion buy either pinfall or submission, it effectively makes the match no disqualification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The match gets under-way with the controversial new title belt and the RAW management team of Mick Foley and Stephanie McMahon ringside.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Finn Balor, the demon king who battled his way past the cream of the RAW roster to earn his opportunity, starts aggressively trying to apply stomps, drop-kicks and his <i>coup de gras</i> finisher from the outset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Seth Rollins, the number one draft pick and automatic Challenger, responds with athletic resilience and powerful offence. A sickening blow to Balor's shoulder from Seth Rollins' bomb to the Barricades slows him only momentarily, responding with his own series of slams and throws until Rollins continues his onslaught.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Nothing can keep the supernatural demon king down though, picking himself up from a pedigree or bouncing back from a buckle bomb to launch dropkick after dropkick and stomp after stomp in return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even the failure of a devastating Small Package Driver has Rollins' frustration and exhaustion building, until Finn unleashes another volley of feet culminating in his <i>coup de gras</i> double-foot stomp, giving the former NXT champion victory over the former WWE champion, to be the first Universal champion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A great match, where Seth Rollins' agile and usually effective attack was no match for the supernatural resilience and single-mindedness of Finn Balor.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Rusev (c) vs. Roman Reigns ? WWE US Championship [RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Before the ring announcer could finish his job and the timekeeper could ring the bell, Roman Reigns had launched a ringside attack on Rusev, demolishing the Bulgarian. Reigns bangs and bashes him off of every object available, leaving him with damaged ribs, unable to compete and surrounded by officials. A short, brutal, but somewhat exciting non-match.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">'The Viper' Randy Orton vs. 'The Beast Incarnate' Brock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman) [SD/RAW]</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">So here we are, the main event between two of 21<sup>st</sup>century wrestling's biggest names for the first time on a PPV event. A series of videos hyping the rivalry, finishing with a volley of verbal abuse from Brock Lesnar, plus the entourages ringside helps the big fight feel - and it certainly does feel more like an impending fight than a wrestling match.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">From the outset, Brock seems Intent on applying his MMA style offence, sending Orton to the corners with punches, forearms and elbows. Orton himself manages to get enough space to attempt an RKO, which is deflected and only provokes Lesnar to take him to suplex City with half a dozen Germans.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">The ringside area is no refuge for Randy either, Brock plucking him from the crowd to toss him through the Smackdown announce table on the second attempt, before dragging him to the ring for a 7th German suplex. The RAW announce table looks to be next, but the deadly Viper strikes with an RKO, leaving Lesnar stunned across the table instead. Back in the ring, a second RKO only serves to provoke the Beast Incarnate into an F-5.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">It is at this point, with twenty-twenty hindsight, that Orton probably should have stayed down for the three-count. Brock discarded his gloves and elbow-pads and just brutalised Orton's head with a series of sickening blows, including an elbow strike that gashed deep, causing blood to pool on the canvas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He sent the officials and doctors scattering multiple times, going back to rain down more fists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Paul Heyman's face was ashen at his client's destruction, and not even the intervention of Shane McMahon was enough to stop the psychotic Beast, taking an unexpected F-5 to lie there nursing his ribs. Lesnar wins by TKO.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">A shocking, brutal and bloody finale to this epic of an event.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">But wait! There's more on this disc, the three under-card, pre-show matches included in 'Special Features' are great value for their addition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The <b>12-Man SmackDown Tag</b> match was as fast and fun as the later 6-Woman equivalent, <b>Zayn &amp; Neville vs. The Dudley Boyz</b> was a good show of athleticism against experience, and the first of the, potentially epic, Best-of-Seven heavyweight series in <b>Sheamus vs. Cesaro.</b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Whilst not all the matches earn the distinction of being 'Great' there are plenty of classic and shocking moments on this DVD set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Styles versus Cena, the inaugural Universal Championship match and the bloody conclusion will all get looked upon as pivotal moments in WWE history, I'm sure, and with the bulk of the remaining matches being well constructed and entertaining, this set is fantastic value for money.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">Out 10/10/2016 on </span><a href="http://www.wwedvd.co.uk/"><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">www.wwedvd.co.uk</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;dejavu sans&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt;">.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:183:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/4721790106375913226/comments/defaulthttp://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2016/10/wwe-summerslam-2016-dvd-review-by-tim.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4721790106375913226";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default/4721790106375913226";s:4:"link";s:89:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/2016/10/wwe-summerslam-2016-dvd-review-by-tim.html";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}}s:7:"channel";a:13:{s:2:"id";s:45:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7798016748748074444";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-03-06T08:31:17.269-08:00";s:5:"title";s:21:"Wrestling's Last Hope";s:8:"subtitle";s:60:"LIKE us on facebook - http://facebook.com/WrestlingsLastHope";s:42:"link_http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed";s:58:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"link_self";s:62:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default";s:4:"link";s:39:"http://wrestlingslasthope.blogspot.com/";s:8:"link_hub";s:32:"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/";s:9:"link_next";s:92:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7798016748748074444/posts/default?start-index=26&max-results=25";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Stu Rodgers";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09959845838371027660";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:9:"generator";s:7:"Blogger";}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:4:"Atom";s:12:"feed_version";N;s:8:"encoding";s:10:"ISO-8859-1";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:15:"source_encoding";s:5:"UTF-8";s:4:"etag";s:70:"W/"d3c0e9444c3775ee6a27bbf4d9892c6c16d4812d67674244ce4c682afab9f8e2"
