I&#8217;m better than you.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A good friend of mine recently reopened a wonderful little spot in Tacoma, complete with tasty craft cocktails and a wonderful food menu that matches nicely with each featured drink. I decided last Sunday that I would go pay her a visit.</p>
<p>It was relatively late, and the evening crowd had died down to just a customer or two, and the friend I went to see had actually taken the day off. As it turned out, the head chef, who also happens to be a friend, was sitting at the bar and I decided to join him.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, warm summer night. I ordered a glass of Bastille 1789 Whisky over ice, and we sat and listened to a cover of the Dave Brubeck Quartet&#8217;s <em>Take Five</em> (which is titled <em>The Russians are Coming</em>) done by Jamaican reggae saxophonist Val Bennett that was playing over the sound system. It was a perfect setting to talk about music, and that is exactly what happened for the next several hours.</p>
<p>Here is the catch: Riley (the chef), was  highly trained at multiple conservatories as a classical trumpeter. I attended and played trumpet at one of the best jazz schools in the country. That might not seem all that interesting, but the reality of the joke that I started the blog post off with is something that many trumpet players find true, even in the most casual and friendly of settings and conversations.</p>
<p>The earliest settings for a young trumpet player, be it a concert band or a jazz big band,  are designed to create competition. No matter how young, there are auditions, and musicians are encouraged to challenge each other for their chair. The best gets to play the solo, the rest of the section gets to sit there and watch. Who can play higher? Who can play faster? Who has the best tone?</p>
<p>Riley and I get along magnificently, and this conversation was no exception. We have had so many conversations about other things during the course of our relationship that it had almost escaped both of our minds that the other person had a legitimate musical background.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Riley focused primarily on classical, while I focused on jazz. Riley, as he explained, was known for a beautiful tone and his ability to incorporate personal creativity to his classical performances. I, at one point, had great range, which I eventually gave less attention to in order to become a better improviser.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Riley is and was a better trumpet player and overall musician than I am, and we probably both know it. But there are rules to being a trumpet player. And once you and a fellow trumpeter start talking horn, the inevitable &#8220;trumpet measuring contest&#8221; proceeds, even in the most friendly of settings.</p>
<p>One of us would mention a venue we had been to or played at. The other one &#8220;out-venued&#8221; that first venue. There was the inevitable comparison of horns that we had used. We compared our experiences with Wynton Marsalis. There were several causal &#8220;You know who trumpeter John Doe or composer Jane Doe is, don&#8217;t you? Oh, you don&#8217;t, well let me tell you why you should.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through all of this, the conversation was interesting, friendly, and in good nature. There was not a malicious or derogatory word or tone included, and we were never tired of what the other person was saying. But just like a &#8220;friendly game of tennis&#8221;, it is instinctual,  if it is not intentional, that both players show off their chops.</p>
<p>There is always one easy, yet often uncomfortable way to end a conversation where trumpet players are talking trumpet: compare embouchure changes. An embouchure change is when a trumpet player changes the way the mouthpiece sits on his or her lips in an effort to improve tone, range or some other sound related element. It is rarely easy, takes a considerable amount of time, and is almost always frustrating. When this topic came up between Riley and I, you could see the life slowly leave our faces, as we were reminded of more painful times in our trumpet career. There was no need to continue our trumpet conversation after that, no more need to compete, and we both knew it without saying another word. We sat in silence for a minute or two, until one of us brought up bad horror movies that the other should see.</p>
<p><em>Since the first draft of this post, I made sure to ask Riley if it was OK to use his name and our discussion in this post. I informed him that I was using a trumpet player joke at the top of the post. He replied with &#8220;Oh man, I&#8217;ve got a ton of trumpet player jokes if you want to use one of mine.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Harry Connick, Jr. has built a reputation for musical and emotional honesty. Never one to rest on his ever-growing list of laurels, Connick exposes his feelings as never before on Every Man Should Know. The new CD contains twelve original songs for which Connick wrote music, lyrics and arrangements.</p>
<p>&#8220;No rules, no limits,&#8221; is how the multi-talented artist describes the songs in his liner notes for the new collection. &#8220;I don t recall ever reaching quite as deeply or confidently into my inhibition pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now in its 30th year, the Keith Jarrett Trio is widely considered, as the NY Times recently remarked, to have set the gold standard for jazz groups, and this sparkling concert recording from 2009 is issued to mark a milestone anniversary.</p>
<p>The Somewhere in which the Standards trio find themselves is Lucerne, Switzerland with a performance both exploratory and in-the-tradition. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung headlined its review of the show Kontrollierte Ekstase controlled ecstasy an apt metaphor for a set that begins in improvisational Deep Space modulates into Miles Davis Solar, soars through the standards Stars Fell On Alabama and Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea and climaxes with an extended romp through West Side Story, as Bernsteins Somewhere and Tonight are bridged by the freely associative Jarrett original Everywhere.</p>

<p>?I?ve always believed that in life, what you keep in your mind is what you draw to yourself.? That?s how trumpeter/composer Terence Blanchard explains the title of his 20th album, Magnetic, which finds a stunning variety of sounds and styles pulled together by the irresistible force of Blanchard?s vision.</p>

<p>Gary Peacock and Marilyn Crispell made outstanding music together in her trio with the late Paul Motian, the three kindred spirits recording the ECM albums Nothing ever was, anyway (1997) and Amaryllis (2001) each a modern classic. The New York Times called the pair two of the most beautiful piano-trio records in recent memory. The Peacock-Crispell duo project also has a history, albeit one undocumented on disc until now, with Azure. This extraordinary new album proves that these two musicians shared sense of lyricism, their distinctive compositional styles and their profound backgrounds in free improvisation make them exceptional musical partners in the most intimate of settings.</p>

<p>Robert Walter performs all his own stunts. For 20 years, the San Diego native has been pulling drawbars and pushing the limits of the Hammond B3 organ. As a founding member of the Greyboy Allstars, he helped usher in the funk-jazz renaissance of the early &#8217;90s and has continued to keep one hand comping chords in the instrument&#8217;s funky past, while the other explores ever-new melodic terrain. On June 25, his long-standing project, Robert Walter&#8217;s 20th Congress, returns with, Get Thy Bearings, via The Royal Potato Family. It was a recent move from New Orleans to Los Angeles that jump-started the 20th Congress who hadn&#8217;t recorded a studio album in ten years. The nine-track effort presents Walter&#8217;s organ, piano, Rhodes and synthesizer driving an all-star line-up rounded out by guitarist/bassist Elgin Park, drummer Aaron Redfield, sax players Karl Denson and Cochemea Gastelum, and percussionist Chuck Prada.</p>

<p>Based on actual conversations:</p>
<h2>WHY WE NEED THIS MOVIE #1</h2>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  I&#8217;m going to watch this movie, <em>&#8220;The Girls In The Band.&#8221;  </em>And hopefully write a review.</p>
<p><strong>Hip Old Jazz Radio Dude</strong>:  Oh, yeah?  What&#8217;s it about, chick singers?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  Um, no.  It&#8217;s about the great female instrumentalists who couldn&#8217;t get hired by the big bands, or almost any band led by a man.</p>
<p><strong>HOJRD</strong>:  Didn&#8217;t they have those all-girl bands to play in?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  Well, that&#8217;s what they had to resort to in order to make a living.  And even then, they were treated as novelty acts, not as &#8220;real&#8221; musicians.  Many of them were better players than their male counterparts, but they had to put on frilly dresses and smile all the time.  You know, I think &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>HOJRD</strong>:  (<em>eyes glazing over, attention span limit reached</em>) Oh, yeah, yeah, right.  Excuse me, I have to go dust off this turntable&#8230;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>WHY WE NEED THIS MOVIE #2</h2>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  I really enjoyed your playing tonight!</p>
<p><strong>Very Young Female Saxophonist</strong>:  Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  Are you glad you continued with your music after college?  It couldn&#8217;t have been an easy career choice.</p>
<p><strong>VYFS</strong>:  Um, what?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>:  Well, historically, female jazz instrumentalists were largely ignored, or treated with disdain by male musicians.  They&#8217;d never get called for gigs, or if they actually got into a band, they could be replaced with a male musician at any time, without any notice.  You know, I think&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>VYFS</strong>:  (<em>looking at me like I&#8217;m deranged</em>)  I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.  Excuse me, I have to go adjust my reed&#8230;</p>
<p>Alternately touching and humorous, <em>The Girls In The</em> Band is a delightful movie that can serve as a primer for the nearly forgotten story of  the talented, hard-working, dedicated musicians who just happened to be female during a time when &#8220;girls just don&#8217;t do that!&#8221;  It&#8217;s nicely paced, moving between interviews and archival film footage and photos, and filled with great music.  The older musicians tell their tales, the hurts and disappointments still fresh; the good times, the excitement and the love lingering and making it all worthwhile.  The younger musicians listen, learn and pay tribute.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thegirlsintheband.com/">The Girls in the Band</a> has won Audience Awards at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Omaha Film Festival and the Victoria Film Festival.  Director/Producer Judy Chaikin has a couple of Emmy nominations under her belt for her documentaries, as well as numerous film festival awards and a Blue Ribbon from the American Educational Film and TV Festival.  A theme running through most of Chaikin&#8217;s work is &#8220;righting a wrong,&#8221; and she spent eight years making this film so that the stories and the art of these musicians would not disappear.</p>
<p>One can forgive the hip old jazz guy for being from another era.  One can rejoice that the very young jazz girls don&#8217;t have to deal with the same issues that plagued their predecessors.  Both could still benefit from watching this entertaining slice of history.</p>

They all died before reaching the age of 40. Actually, four of the eight died before reaching the age of 30!  Seven died before 1944 and one died in 1956. The greatest jazz band in history has been playing in heaven for more than 50 years!<br />
     The film presents this band, organized in heaven, playing Stardust, ?a tune recorded in heaven.? (They each recorded Stardust individually as a leader or sideman before they died. An audio engineer has been able to take some of each of these individual recordings and produce a beautiful version that can be heard in this film for the first time.)<br />
     When these men were chosen, serendipitously, by Howard E. Fischer, the producer, director and writer, he did not realize that they actually comprised what could be a functioning band ? rhythm section (piano, drums, guitar and bass), two tenor saxes and two trumpets. Who are these men?<br />
     The rhythm section consists of Fats Waller, piano (died at 39 in 1943); Charlie Christian, guitar (died at 25 in 1942); Jimmy Blanton, bass (died at 23 in 1942); and Chick Webb, drums (died at 34 in 1939) who was not available for this recording (he never recorded this tune), so Big Sid Catlett sat in for him. The two tenors are Herschel Evans (died at 29 in 1939) and Chu Berry (died at 33 in 1941). The two trumpeters are Bunny Berigan (died at 33 in 1942) and Clifford Brown (died at 25 in 1956).<br />
     The film also presents one piece of music each artist recorded that highlights his great talents. Interspersed is biographical information, expert commentary, photos and other material related to each. The film introduces these musicians and their music in the hope that more people will explore their music and learn about their lives. In addition, as an important aspect of the film, music historians talk about how the musicians? lifestyles contributed to their deaths and how they died.  At the end of the film a scroll lists about 20 other jazz musicians who died before the age of 40.<br />
     Additional funding is needed to complete the film.<br />
     More information about the film can be found on Kickstarter, a funding platform -http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jazzfilm/they-died-before-40.<br />

<p>Seattle&#8217;s Julian Priester is one of 25 Jazz Heroes designated by the Jazz Journalists Association to celebrate those who have had a significant impact on their jazz communities.  There will be a Jazz Hero award presentation for Julian Priester at <a href="http://tulas.com/" target="_blank">Tula&#8217;s</a> at 6 PM PST on Tuesday, April 30, International Jazz Day.</p>
<p>Trombonist Julian Priester, also known as Pepo Mtoto (?Spirit Child?), has from the very beginning of his musical career demonstrated Zen-like equanimity when presented with conflicts or opposites. Growing up in a South Side of Chicago neighborhood with the hard rocking blues of Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley in his head but high school band disciplinarian Captain Walter Dyett instructing him in something very different may have had something to do with it. Or maybe it is just his calm personality, his ability to listen and absorb, and the subtlety of his expressivity, characteristics evident in his own music of the past nearly 60 years, from his first jobs in Sun Ra?s Arkestra through his retirement last year from the faculty of Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle.</p>
