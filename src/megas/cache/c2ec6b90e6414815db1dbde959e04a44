Only reason I ask is that I currently receive 8 local DAB muxs and would wonder if I may lose one for the new Manchester mux if a licence is granted.
I live in Wrexham and the 8 locals I receive are:
10B Derbyshire
10C Liverpool
10D Wrexham Chester Liverpool
11B Wolverhampton
11C Birmingham
12A Lancashire

I always enjoy reading your comments even if, as now, I have some reservations about them.
You say that my view is fixed: yes, guilty as charged. I do have a fixed view about we in the UK having to accept a method of transmission (mono)  which hasn&#039;t applied to FM radio or LP records for over 50 years or to CDs at all, at the same time being assured that DAB is the future and having been assured in the past that it would provide near CD quality.The UK was once the leader in DAB but the same cannot be said now and the question I would ask is why stations here can&#039;t afford to pay for higher bit rates when those in other countries can: is it due to the higher charges made here by the multiplex operators (who themselves may be being charged more)?
I also can&#039;t agree that Digital Radio has allowed an explosion in choice: numbers of stations yes, but choice not much. Wohnort tells that, for example, the South Yorkshire multiplex provides 11 stations of which 8 are described as  pop stations and Teeside supplies 11 of which 9 are similarly described. I wouldn&#039;t deny that there has been some broadening of choice but where are the stations for those who don&#039;t like pop music but want to hear jazz, sport, classics, drama, standards, news etc? There are practically none.
You refer to the probability of half-empty multiplexes if my fixed view carried the day: we have these already. According to Wohnort there are several with only 5 stations as well as 1 with 4 and 2 transmitting just 3.
I am quite sure that many of the big stations fear  the introduction of DAB+ because it would result in their being faced with new, competing ones and imagine they view what is happening on the Portsmouth minimux with increasing concern that this is how the situation will develop. I believe that of the major players Muxco is the most forward-looking as indeed are your own Fun Kids as well as Jazz FM and Magic chilled.
