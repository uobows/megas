Text Fields are used for a variety of data types such as entry of e-mails, phones, etc. Which is why sometimes it becomes important to have some kinf of explanatory text to clarify for the user the meaning of each text field. In its gadgets such as iPhone, Apple has been faithful to  the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words, and created text fields that allow to understand at a glance what each of them is meant for. To provide equal ease to all web developers and web enthusiasts, we have developed <strong>Light Edit</strong>, a text field that can represent a common text field or a field that can be used for entry of a telephone number, email address,  or simply to filter search.

<p>In recent years, Apple has been known as one of the leaders in innovation, in both technology and design. It is proven by such market-leading devices as iPod, iPhone and iPad. These innovations have now become trends followed by most of web developers who in their projects have incorporated visual features and controls similar to those used in Apple devices. But developing these new controls is not an easy task. We have undertaken the task of developing a set of controls that not only meets the needs of experienced web developers, but can also be used by any web enthusiast. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Smart List</strong> is a control that imitates the way listings are displayed in an iPhone. <strong>Smart List</strong> contains a list of links defined by the user, and a letters column on the right, which acts as a shortcut to move directly to the options beginning with that letter. The <strong>Smart List's</strong> visual aspect is simple and sleek, and it can be changed directly in the visual styles file. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Smart List</strong> has been developed as an extension for Adobe Dreamweaver, which simplifies its use and integration into your website.
