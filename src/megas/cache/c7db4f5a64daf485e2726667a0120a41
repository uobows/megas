Having worked as a corporate medical director for disability insurers, I can affirm your analysis. Most claims do not go for independent assessment, whether by file review or IME; they are simply paid. Of those that do go out, if they always come back critical of the treating provider, then it could be that the evaluating physicians aren&#039;t given appropriate attention, or it could be that the claims staff is being too conservative, and never sending something about which they are unsure. The independent examiner/evaluator&#039;s role isn&#039;t to be a rubber stamp, and it isn&#039;t to bend over backward to support the claimant: their job is to be fair and base opinions on evidence. Some do that better than others - teaching physicians and psychologists how to do that well is my passion.
