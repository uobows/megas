<p>	The support of our Friends is vital in keeping this wonderful legacy going. Without it future Festivals are uncertain and their programmes restricted in vision.</p>
<p>	Since its inception in 1964, the Bollington Festival has enriched the lives of so many people who live in and around Bollington, and in 2019 it will be doing so again with your help.</p>
<p>	Each festival has been a catalyst for new events and partnerships bringing new creative activities to the community. It has developed over the years with a positive impact on village life and engendered a true community spirit.</p>
<p>	Over the last 50+ years, Bollington Festival has given birth to a Community Theatre company, Choir, Light Opera Group, Children?s Music Theatre, Chamber Concert series, prize-winning Brass Band, Sci(ence) Bar evenings and regular Jazz and Comedy night sessions within a thriving Arts Centre.</p>
<p>	<strong>So please support Bollington Festival 2019. </strong>We need to ensure funding is in place before 2019 in order to implement all the wonderful ideas the vibrant community of Bollington has suggested for its next Festival.</p>
<p>	Become a Festival Friend, and not only support the Festival in 2019, but see how you can benefit too.</p>

<p>	As well as providing a 'venue' for amateur and professional events in music, drama, literature, photography, art, sport and science (to name but a few); the Bollington Festival has provided the catalyst for a variety of local activities and societies that continue to educate and entertain the community.
