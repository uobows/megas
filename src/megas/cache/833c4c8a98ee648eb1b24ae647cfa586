His opening remarks gave a nod to history: ?This is BBC Radio Stoke on Trent. We must apologise to listeners for the break in transmission which occurred at 12 o'clock midnight, on October 30th 1928. This was due to circumstances beyond our control. Normal transmission has now been resumed?.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The local authority in Stoke was a keen advocate of the local radio experiments and had secured sufficient funding for the first two years. The area had been involved in the 1961 broadcasting trials proposed by Frank Gillard and recordings of the Stoke tests had been used in the submission to the Pilkington Committee. Supposedly BBC Radio Stoke-on-Trent (it was shortened to BBC Radio Stoke in the 1980s) was set to go on-air earlier but the outbreak on foot and mouth in 1967 had prevented engineers crossing fields to access the VHF mast at Alsagers Bank near Newcastle-under-Lyme. In the event the station launched using a low-powered VHF transmitter at Hanchurch Water Tower south of Stoke. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VXA2CtnuLcI/WpmAFd2aLeI/AAAAAAAAHBk/m1xMgvDGCnMgasSgRggufNFUD-wCbyxgwCLcBGAs/s1600/Radio%2BStoke%2BNews.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="315" data-original-width="470" height="214" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VXA2CtnuLcI/WpmAFd2aLeI/AAAAAAAAHBk/m1xMgvDGCnMgasSgRggufNFUD-wCbyxgwCLcBGAs/s320/Radio%2BStoke%2BNews.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The station came on air at 5 p.m. on the 14th - complete with its own ID theme, a nod to the Potteries heritage composed by the Radiophonic Workshop using the sound of tinkling fine bone china - with an announcement from manager Harold Williams and then John Snagge.

Its planned launch date was 14 February 1968 but the station had already made an impromptu appearance in December 1967 (from some old BBC regional studios at the Royal Pavilion) when snow storms brought Sussex grinding to a halt, thus immediately demonstrating the value of a local service in bad weather and the importance of a 'snow line'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A23psrnKwNE/Wn3LSmqqMhI/AAAAAAAAG_Y/GXYx3lT08akB-HxR8T7Fv84tlnX6YQ7jACLcBGAs/s1600/Marlborough%2BPlace%2Bstudios.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="858" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A23psrnKwNE/Wn3LSmqqMhI/AAAAAAAAG_Y/GXYx3lT08akB-HxR8T7Fv84tlnX6YQ7jACLcBGAs/s320/Marlborough%2BPlace%2Bstudios.jpg" width="268" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pulling together the new station was Bob Gunnell. Bob had joined the BBC engineering staff in the 1940s and by the late 50s was a producer and then later presenter working on such programmes as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Younger Generation</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Listen Awhile</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Home This Afternoon</i>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Brighton's studios were located at the old Blenheim Hotel on the corner of Marlborough Place (pictured above). Helping to kit it out was station engineer Ted Castle who'd previously worked for the OB unit in London and second engineer George Orchard. Bob's deputy, was programme organiser David Waine. David had been at TV reporter for the BBC in Southampton and would go on to manage BBC Radio Bristol, then as regional Television manger in Plymouth and finally as head of Network Production Centre and then Head of Broadcasting BBC Midlands at Pebble Mill. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Bob Gunnell famously made two quirky managerial decisions when the station launched. First he was very much against playing any pop announcing that "we aim to be a sweet station rather than a hard pop music station." More controversially was the insistence on time checks being given in 24-hour clock much to the confusion of presenters, contributors and listeners alike, though this directive was soon dropped. Bob remained in charge of the station for 15 years and following his retirement he served on the local council, was a magistrate and helped create the Brighton and Hove Arts Council. He died in 2014 aged 87.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7fXIjwpB7c/Wn3KYjM485I/AAAAAAAAG_A/NXuijH6R38YvEKyuZSz7agtJHlUGT0fZwCLcBGAs/s1600/John%2BHenty.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="500" height="256" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7fXIjwpB7c/Wn3KYjM485I/AAAAAAAAG_A/NXuijH6R38YvEKyuZSz7agtJHlUGT0fZwCLcBGAs/s320/John%2BHenty.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Other staff appointed were John Henty (pictured above), Keith Slade, Mike Matthews, Chris Jones, Hilda Bamber and Carole Stone. Mike had gained his broadcasting experience in New Zealand at NZBC and would later be part of the launch team at Radio 210. Hilda Bamber had started broadcasting with the BFBS and had for some commercial station experience in New Zealand. She would later join Radio 4 as a continuity announcer before becoming an IRN newsreader. Carole Stone had started at <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the BBC in 1963 as a news copy-taker. She remained with Radio Brighton until 1970 when she joined Radio 4 as a talks producer and then to BBC Bristol where she produced <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Down Your Way</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Any Questions?</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The station officially went on air at 6 p.m. on Wednesday 14 February 1968 with the Mayor of Brighton, Councillor Ronald Bates, cutting a piece of recording tape across the station entrance. A star-studded cast told the story of the town; Laurence Olivier, Flora Robson, John Clements and Dora Bryan all lived locally. Other guests, introduced by Mike Matthews included Elsie and Doris Waters, perhaps suggesting that the station wasn't too interested in pulling in a young audience. The opening programme also included an OB with John Henty positioned on Sussex Heights, then the tallest building in the area, where he was to describe the view. Unfortunately, a heavy sea mist came down and he had to explain his predicament and rely on his memory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is how the Radio Brighton's programme schedule looked for the week commencing 16 October 1971. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vaRCxobJ_14/Wn3KMynv3tI/AAAAAAAAG-4/bAOqo_pLvjwfRT8iaQgpS8D2Tau2Wx1MACLcBGAs/s1600/Brighton_RT%2B161071.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1251" height="640" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vaRCxobJ_14/Wn3KMynv3tI/AAAAAAAAG-4/bAOqo_pLvjwfRT8iaQgpS8D2Tau2Wx1MACLcBGAs/s640/Brighton_RT%2B161071.jpg" width="500" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">One of the best known voices in the early days of BBC Radio Brighton was that of John Henty. Born and educated in Surrey John started his working life as a clerk for Shell before joining the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Croydon Advertiser </i>as a junior reporter. He lists his first broadcast as reading the news on KIST in Santa Barbara in March 1960, although I've no idea what he was doing over in California at that time. He spent five years with BEA as an airline public relations officer and was also volunteering for a local hospital radio station where he eventually started to provide football commentary. It was that commentating experience that swung him the job at Radio Brighton, nominally in charge of their sports programmes. He presented local radio's first travel show, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Travel Bag</i>&nbsp;('produced in collaboration with local travel agents' per the programme billing) and in the mid-70s had the distinction of broadcasting on the breakfast show, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Coastwise</i>, a feature called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">My Early Bird Club</i> that was introduced by a worm called Wurley. John went on to work at Blue Danube Radio and in the late 80s made programmes for hospital radio sponsored by British Telecom under the title <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nice 'n' Easy</i>. He also a leading authority on the British illustrator Mabel Lucie Atwell and founded and ran a museum dedicated to her. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wQcmXbMVrfE/Wn3KTEIhz8I/AAAAAAAAG-8/YyHdPD8zGRUvQp3NEOJOv_YboNU2zlj1gCLcBGAs/s1600/Keith%2BSlade.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="588" data-original-width="388" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wQcmXbMVrfE/Wn3KTEIhz8I/AAAAAAAAG-8/YyHdPD8zGRUvQp3NEOJOv_YboNU2zlj1gCLcBGAs/s320/Keith%2BSlade.jpg" width="211" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keith Slade (above) was brought into the station having had no broadcasting experience and in time became a regular arts programme producer. Born in Brighton he'd studied drama and worked for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Argus</i> for a short time before going into teaching at the Florence Moore Theatre School in Hove. His knowledge of the local arts scene gave him the opportunity to contribute to many Radio Brighton programmes until his retirement in 1988.

Leaving the station in 1998 he returned to programme making, principally for Radio 4 with series such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Making History</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Rare Books, Rare People </i>and a number of editions of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Archive Hour</i>.

He moved over to commercial radio when that started in 1974 at Swansea Sound. Later he worked at KNET in Texas, Radio Orwell, Radio 210, Blue Danube Radio and was programme controller at Chiltern Radio when that launched in 1981. By the end of the eighties Phil moved over to television as a continuity announcer and then promotions director at Anglia TV. He was a production manager at QVC and set up his own production company TVUK.

Paul had returned to his home town after been given the boot by his Radio 2 bosses as one of the hosts of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Breakfast Special</i>. He freelanced for a while and that included a spell at Radio Brighton. By 1976 he was up in Reading as the launch DJ on Radio 210. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal">You'll also spot as one of the contributors on <i>Trend</i> the name of Jeremy Pascall. Jeremy was an NME reporter and first appeared on BBC Radio Brighton in 1969 as part of <i>Pop Inside</i> team alongside Anne Nightingale and Tony Baker to discuss the Brighton music scene. He'd go on to join Capital Radio where he is perhaps best known for <i>The Uncyclopedia of Rock</i> and being part of the <i>Brunch</i> team. For the BBC he and Phil Swern were the question setters on a number of TV and radio quizzes. He died in 2001.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">One of Radio Brighton's best-known alumni is Desmond Lynam. Appearing on the station a few weeks after it had gone on air Des was working in banking and then insurance. He'd dabbled in writing the odd sports article for local papers and football magazines. In 1968 the station had advertised that it was looking for volunteers and Des was invited in by David Waine and given an audition. He soon found himself reading the Saturday afternoon football results and other sports news. "In no time at all, under the experienced eye of an amiable chap called John Henty, I was presenting the Saturday night sports desk. Soon I was writing a weekly review of the local press, which involved arriving at the studio at 6.30 in the morning; reading through the three local weekly papers and writing, by hand, a three-minute piece to be voiced live just before the 8 a.m. news bulletins". </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Des remembers an early attempt at radio comedy: "Together with Ivan Howlett, John Henty, Peter Vincent (who went on to be a top comedy writer for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Two Ronnies</i>and others), and a girl singer called Amaryllis, I began putting together and performing in a Sunday half-hour show called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">How Lunchtime It Is </i>- there was a TV series called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">How Late It Is</i> that had prompted the idea for the title". Apparently Des's contribution included passable imitations of Harold Wilson and Ted Heath.

The post-war Home Service also had an East Midlands Representative housed in the Bentinck Buildings in Wheeler Gate, later Wilson House on Derby Road, who was expected to contribute reports and programmes for the Midlands Region. Throughout the 50s and 60s that representative was Gerald Nethercot, and so he was ideally placed to be appointed as the first Station Manager for Radio Nottingham.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The new station was housed in studios at the back of York House on Mansfield Road transmitting&nbsp; a VHF only service on 94.8Mhz. Gerald Nethercot had gathered together a dozen staff to run the station and after some test transmission it was formally opened on the evening, at 6.00 pm, rather an odd time for a station launch. Programme organiser Robert McLeish introduced the chimes of Little John from the Council House, Nethercot outlined the plans for the new station and there were short speeches from the Lord Mayor and the Postmaster General Edward Short.&nbsp; That evening's entertainment consisted of <i>Wednesday Club</i>, which was an early fixture in the schedules billed as "of special interest to the blind" and presented by George Miller. This was followed by the documentary, <i>Snot's Estate</i>, a light-hearted look at the history of the city written by Emrys Bryson of the <i>Evening Post</i> and produced by Tony Church. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HWMf7pDsdZU/WmYZJoc1f9I/AAAAAAAAGts/UwbA8l033nMoDzhVx9aU9XPHr_2TW5CiACLcBGAs/s1600/Nottingham_RT%2B110169.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="803" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HWMf7pDsdZU/WmYZJoc1f9I/AAAAAAAAGts/UwbA8l033nMoDzhVx9aU9XPHr_2TW5CiACLcBGAs/s640/Nottingham_RT%2B110169.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here's how the Radio Nottingham schedules looked (above) after nearly a year of operation, with the <i>Radio Times </i>listings for the week commencing 11 January 1969. Typically of the early local stations though they broadcast throughout the day, from just before 7.00 am to around 8.00 pm the actual number of hours on air totalled about seven, with various gaps during the day given over to network programmes which, according to the blurb at the top of the page, were taken from Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. So in between the local programmes you'd have a burst of the JY Prog and <i>The World at One</i>, though I'm not aware they ever switched over to Radio 3. &nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is how BBC Radio Nottingham sounded in its early days together with some later clips from the early 70s:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><audio controls="" src="http://randomradio.net/audio/LR_Nottingham.mp3" style="height: 40px; width: 300px;"><embed autoplay="false" height="150" src="https://randomradio.net/audio/LR_Nottingham.mp3" width="250"></embed></audio> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There was no breakfast show as such and the early morning schedule had the look of the old Home Service about it with short programmes billed as <i>Town Crier</i> and <i>Morning Town Ride</i> interspersed with the national news, presumably Radio 4's 10-minute bulletins. No presenters are listed but they will have been drawn from the team of presenter/producers who, when the station launched, were Tony Church, Tony Cook (ex.

One of those writing the bulletins was John Hobson (pictured above) over at Bradshaw's News Agency. "Our office was across the city, and the one who drew the short straw had a fifteen-minute walk to the studio carrying the bulletin in a big brown envelope". John had started his journalistic career at <i>Ilkeston Advertiser</i> and then the <i>Ilkeston Pioneer</i>, <i>Wolverhampton Star</i>, <i>Nottingham Evening News</i> and then the <i>Nottingham Post</i>. In 1970 he was asked to form the first BBC local radio station newsroom at Nottingham where he became the news editor.

Dennis McCarthy came from an acting family and had ended up in Nottingham when he was evacuated during World War Two. He was a movie collector and a dog breeder of some renown, and it was because of this that he got the chance to make his first broadcast with a report about Crufts within a few days of the station going on air. On the back of his performance he was offered some other freelance report work and eventually some programmes, one of the earliest I can trace is a 15-minute <i>Mapperley Hospital Show</i>. By 1969 he'd got his own show of music and interviews, <i>Date with Dennis</i> which ran for a number of years and he also presented &nbsp;<i>Take the Lead</i> billed as 'local dog news and the breed of the week'. A regular Sunday show followed - in which he managed to rope in his own family, son Owen (aka Digger) and daughter Tara - and by 1974 he'd gained what would be his regular weekday slot, <i>Afternoon Special</i>, which ran until his untimely death in 1996. &nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can read and hear more about Dennis McCarthy on <a href="http://davidlloyd-radio.blogspot.fr/2016/01/our-dennis.html" target="_blank">David Lloyd's Radio Moments blog</a>. &nbsp;</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Radio Nottingham team will be celebrating 50 years on air this Wednesday and Trevor Dann has compiled a retrospective of the station's history called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05vm6n7" target="_blank">On the Street Where You Live</a>&nbsp; Presented by Simon Mayo it was broadcast yesterday and will be availlable to listen again for 29 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:161:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/feeds/4277048886559451936/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2744024699281834535&postID=4277048886559451936";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/4277048886559451936";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/4277048886559451936";s:4:"link";s:82:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/2018/01/down-your-local-bbc-radio-nottingham.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Andy Walmsley";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13647763223166778941";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:4;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2744024699281834535.post-8916722675457547805";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-16T22:40:00.000+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-16T22:41:55.044+01:00";s:5:"title";s:9:"Ed Doolan";s:12:"atom_content";s:5250:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XvjZ35k5dj8/Wl5CPtl8boI/AAAAAAAAGtI/b6XhQK1EUtIPJF-wHua6lNgpCHWiqd2XACLcBGAs/s1600/Ed%2BDoolan%2B%2528BBC%2BWM%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="409" data-original-width="615" height="212" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XvjZ35k5dj8/Wl5CPtl8boI/AAAAAAAAGtI/b6XhQK1EUtIPJF-wHua6lNgpCHWiqd2XACLcBGAs/s320/Ed%2BDoolan%2B%2528BBC%2BWM%2529.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">For four decades Ed Doolan was one of the broadcasters that defined radio for the listening folk of the West Midlands. An intelligent interviewer, a champion of consumer affairs and with one of the biggest contact books in the business Aussie-born Ed became an honorary Brummie on BRMB and BBC WM. His death was announced today.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Born in 1941 in Sydney, Australia Ed had always wanted to be a broadcaster but his parents had other ideas and were keen for him to have a career in teaching. &nbsp;But that didn't stop him hanging around the Macquarie Broadcasting audience shows in the 50s and 60s to get his radio fix. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Like many fellow young Australians he chose to pursue his career in the UK and in 1966 he became a teacher in Edinburgh and then London. By 1970 he'd moved across to West Germany as part of an exchange programme and dipped his toe into radio at Deutsche Welle. "Some friends who had contacts in Cologne told me they needed an English voice on German Overseas Radio. Mine was near enough". &nbsp;His first broadcast was in September of that year on a 15-minute documentary called <i>Hitch-Hikers in Germany</i>. He also presented Afrika-Englisch Current Affairs for Deutsche Welle, Deutschlandfunk English transmissions to Britain and <i>Top Marks School Quiz</i> for the BFBS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ed moved back to the UK and joined the newly launched BRMB station in Birmingham. Initially presenting the weekday afternoon show he later moved into mid-mornings, a timeslot that later would become his natural home for many years. He was keen to hone his craft and took to recording his own shows. "Every night when I go home I listen to every link," he said in 1975. If&nbsp; something had gone wrong "I will sit and listen to it two or three times until I have put my finger on where it went wrong". Incidentally Ed was a keen home taper and his archive of TV and radio shows have since helped fill some of the gaps left after broadcasters junked their tapes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In September 1982 he jumped over to the opposition at BBC WM presenting a show between 12 noon and 1 pm, later on the breakfast show and then a mid-morning show. As well as covering the news stories of the day he would interview many politicians and celebrities - some of those celebrity set piece interviews have enjoyed repeats on Radio 7/4 Extra. By 1988 his programme started to champion the cause of his listeners and he was adept at challenging local government and companies to sort out injustices and shoddy service. &nbsp;His broadcasting style was, albeit briefly, recognised by network radio when he sat in for Jimmy Young on Radio 2 in 1995 and 1996 but he remained loyal to his West Midlands audience. &nbsp;He was awarded an MBE for his services to broadcasting and charity, won a Gillard Award and was inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In 2011 he stepped down from his daily show, <i>Lunch with Ed Doolan</i> - at the time he was also presenting a Sunday afternoon show, <i>Ed Doolan: Other Side of</i> - and just retained the Friday show and a new 3-hour Sunday morning show. &nbsp;In 2015 he announced that he been coping with dementia for a couple of years but he continued to record introductions for a one-hour Sunday show featuring highlights from his big name interviews and radio archive, with the most recent show going out just a few days ago. </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This tribute programme aired in 2015 and is presented by Jasper Carrott.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><iframe frameborder="0" height="120" src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&amp;light=1&amp;feed=%2Fandy-walmsley2%2Fed-doolan%2F" width="100%"></iframe> <span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ed Doolan (E double D double O LAN) 1941-2018</span></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:161:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/feeds/8916722675457547805/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2744024699281834535&postID=8916722675457547805";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/8916722675457547805";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/8916722675457547805";s:4:"link";s:55:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/2018/01/ed-doolan.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Andy Walmsley";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13647763223166778941";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:5;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2744024699281834535.post-1453046267896896308";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-11T08:00:00.000+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-11T08:00:24.163+01:00";s:5:"title";s:31:"Can I Take That Again? - Part 4";s:12:"atom_content";s:5287:"<div class="MsoNormal"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QQDJpCq6Eg0/WlZH9DqIxJI/AAAAAAAAGss/b7JnxA1C6RckjnKr1ierRONr9FEk0vHbwCLcBGAs/s1600/BBC%2BWogan%2BHouse%2Bsignage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="565" data-original-width="442" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QQDJpCq6Eg0/WlZH9DqIxJI/AAAAAAAAGss/b7JnxA1C6RckjnKr1ierRONr9FEk0vHbwCLcBGAs/s200/BBC%2BWogan%2BHouse%2Bsignage.jpg" width="156" /></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This post should be subtitled <i>The Sound of Silence</i>. When this week's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09kzfdp" target="_blank">Jamie Cullum's Radio 2 show </a>was unexpectedly truncated - a beginning and an end but seemingly the middle section had dropped down a digital black hole - and the 'emergency tape' kicked in it didn't go unnoticed; social media and the fact that it's the biggest station in the UK saw to that. [The full pre-recorded version of Jamie's show is no online]&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The use of playout automation and voice-tracking have long been a feature of radio station output and, for the most part, work seamlessly so listeners shouldn't be able to spot the difference. But when Radio 2 adopted the VCS Autoplayer in September 2012 for a while it was a case of 'mind the gap'. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Radio 2 was aiming to make efficiencies and the use of automation was noticeable in the evening and weekend programming when, one assumes, technical staff were thin on the ground. Most of the early teething problems involved the junctions out of news bulletins with the next programmes fired off at exactly three minutes past the hour cutting off newsreaders in their prime.&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The network's problems were compounded when in January 2013 two programmes played out at the same time with Michael Ball and Russell Davies's show both simultaneously competing for about 15 minutes of airtime. Later that year, in October, we got<a href="http://andywalmsley.blogspot.fr/2013/10/two-for-price-of-one.html" target="_blank"> two Bob Harris's</a> for the price of one when the end of BST seemed to send the system haywire. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here are a few example I collected at the time. </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJziFPNDupM" width="420"></iframe> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Note the jokey but rather pointed comment from Richard Allinson "normal service ... well that went out the window ages ago" was made around the time in 2012 when the old team of newsreaders was phased out and the automation came in.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The news at 1:10 is very odd. This is Susan Rae, on 23 September 2012, presumably reading the 2-minute 11.00 pm Radio 4 bulletin but on Radio 2! Hence we get a full minute of silence before the trailer kicks in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">At 6:19 we get part of the infamous Bob Harris show from 27 October 2013 with two parts being played out at once. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">At 8:24 it's the Ball/Davies cock-up.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And finally at 12:49 from 22 June 2015 Jeremy Vine signing off and Steve Wright loving a technical fault.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Needless to say <i>Feedback</i>picked up on all the drop -outs. On 28 September 2012 they dealt with one minute silence the previous Sunday night which was blamed on an "internal broadcast circuit" plus other losses of lines on <i>Any Questions?</i> and <i>Today</i>. &nbsp;The 1 February 2013 edition called Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan to account who puts it down to 'human error'. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mMEACogKVU" width="420"></iframe>";s:12:"link_replies";s:161:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/feeds/1453046267896896308/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2744024699281834535&postID=1453046267896896308";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/1453046267896896308";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2744024699281834535/posts/default/1453046267896896308";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://andywalmsley.blogspot.com/2018/01/can-i-take-that-again-part-4.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Andy Walmsley";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13647763223166778941";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:6;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2744024699281834535.post-6274479794656614268";s:9:"published";s:29:"2018-01-07T15:00:00.000+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-01-07T15:00:31.459+01:00";s:5:"title";s:22:"Sports Report Turns 70";s:12:"atom_content";s:3881:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PqbKxPh31NE/WlIbJj4xynI/AAAAAAAAGrE/-tgXL-Y3lmsL1wdQZ0cIJYKGxGJU4XqAwCLcBGAs/s1600/SportsReport70.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="549" data-original-width="976" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PqbKxPh31NE/WlIbJj4xynI/AAAAAAAAGrE/-tgXL-Y3lmsL1wdQZ0cIJYKGxGJU4XqAwCLcBGAs/s320/SportsReport70.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In January 2013 I wrote about<a href="http://andywalmsley.blogspot.fr/2013/01/its-five-oclock-time-for-sports-report.html" target="_blank"> <i>Sports Report</i> and Saturday afternoon sports coverage</a>.

In 1977 Ray was coming to the end of a stint presenting the weekend late shows before moving into the early show seat vacated by his mate Colin Berry. Jean Challis was usually to be found linking families around the world on <i>Family Favourites</i>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Live from Broadcasting House the programme also included a visit to the Hilton Hotel to hear Joe Loss and his Orchestra with Ray making the dash over to the hotel to introduce proceedings. Sadly that bit of the show is missing. But there's still just over an hour's worth of audio to savour. &nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Musically speaking we're still in the period when needletime restrictions means that records - from the likes of Roger Whittaker and Peters and Lee so nothing too raucous for a party night - were interspersed with the BBC Radio Orchestra, the BBC Big Band and the Don Lusher Quartet.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Such was the rarity of overnights on Radio 2 that Jean mentions that listeners to BBC Radio Oxford have just joined and there's a hello to BBC staff working over in the Bush House newsroom. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rf-kp1kFSQ/WjLuiDocloI/AAAAAAAAGqA/ERlMkaiiUngFP_CCXi-x-RHFGfNhYMUVgCLcBGAs/s1600/Radios%2B1%25262%2BNew%2BYear%2B1977-8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="734" data-original-width="1251" height="233" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rf-kp1kFSQ/WjLuiDocloI/AAAAAAAAGqA/ERlMkaiiUngFP_CCXi-x-RHFGfNhYMUVgCLcBGAs/s400/Radios%2B1%25262%2BNew%2BYear%2B1977-8.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">John Ireland's illustration for the <i>Radio Times</i>.

Par for the course, if you'll pardon the pun, as most days the old crooner could be found hitting it 'straight down the middle'.&nbsp; After all this was the man that had invested in early tape recoding technology to allow his hugely popular radio shows to be pre-recorded so he could spend more time out on the course.&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Having played the 18th hole at Spain's La Morajela course Bing was heading back to the clubhouse when he was felled by a massive heart attack.

For five decades it's been a case of speaking without hesitation, deviation or repetition. A simple yet frustratingly difficult task that has led to some great comic moments over the 900+ editions that have been heard since <i>Just a Minute </i>first appeared on 22 December 1967.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The programme, devised by Ian Messiter, had had an earlier 1950s radio incarnation under the title <i>One Minute, Please </i>with Roy Plomley, and later Michael Jackson, chairing, though here it was a team game rather than pitting four individual players against each other. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In 1967 Nicholas Parsons was enjoying radio success in the topical satirical comedy series <i><a href="http://andywalmsley.blogspot.fr/2015/03/that-was-week-part-1.html" target="_blank">Listen to this Space</a></i>. Seeking some new challenges he spoke to Ian Messiter who suggested <i>Just a Minute</i>. Getting the green light for the pilot producer David Hatch was called in - David would guide and help shape the programme for its first decade or so - and with Nicholas as one of the panellists it was Jimmy Edwards who was lined up as chairman. In the event Edwards couldn't commit to the show so Nicholas Parsons reluctantly agreed to step in as master of ceremonies, a role he's maintained, apart from some role swapping in early editions, ever since. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The pilot episode was recorded on 16 July 1967 and eventually scheduled as the first edition of a new series to start on Radio 4 that December, thus becoming the newly re-badged network's first bona fide hit. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2L2csb2f1lM/WjKiGlDi9gI/AAAAAAAAGok/gY77zYpk8vQfRSkLGwGn7nZ1uL5vZRq5ACLcBGAs/s1600/JAM_RT%2B221267.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="712" data-original-width="989" height="230" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2L2csb2f1lM/WjKiGlDi9gI/AAAAAAAAGok/gY77zYpk8vQfRSkLGwGn7nZ1uL5vZRq5ACLcBGAs/s320/JAM_RT%2B221267.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Show producer David Hatch writes a humourous introduction<br />for the <i>Radio Times</i> of 22 December 1967</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here is that first outing of <i>Just a Minute</i>. The panel consists of two participants who would become&nbsp; regular players and two who never appeared again. Chef, restaurateur, writer and nightclub owner Clement Freud would eventually clock up 544 editions between 1967 and 2009. His game play tactics were running off lists to fill the time, no mean feat without pausing, and buzzing in with a challenge with a second or two to go, though players couldn't see the clock. With him was actor Derek Nimmo (309 editions until 1999) whose regular foreign travels gave him plenty of material to talk for a minute. The third member was actress Beryl Reid who struggled with the concept, proving that actors used to performing from a script don't always make the best exponents of <i>Just a Minute</i>. I've always wondered who exactly the fourth panellists was as I've never heard the name before. In fact it turns out that Wilma Ewart was one of Nicholas's neighbours who had no experience of performing but who he found "witty and entertaining". Wilma makes a decent job on the show but was never asked back as her and husband had to move back to the USA. </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2ceWp5ipOE" width="420"></iframe> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The game as played in the early series is not what we now know. The rules took some time to bed in; repetition was counted as repetition of an idea as well as words. For a while you couldn't even repeat the words in the subject title and there were penalty rounds such as speaking on a subject without using certain words but these proved inhibiting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The third major player of the game joined for the second series when Derek Nimmo couldn't make the recordings due to filming commitments. Producer David Hatch had been convinced of Kenneth Williams' suitability for the game after seeing him on the panel of BBC TV's <i>Call My Bluff</i> and he asked Williams to initially do six programmes. According to Kenneth's diary it seems it was a somewhat reluctant agreement: "unfortunately it means working with that Parsons fellow, but I said yes, 'cos it will be a nice fill-in". His attitude to the chairman had mellowed somewhat by the time of the recording and it also touches on the fact that Hatch would have to had to continually keep Kenneth happy and praise his contributions: "... when we came to the performance I just about managed and scraped through. But Nicholas was a great help and so was Clemet Freud. David Hatch was very nice to me before (when I was actually v. nervous) and afterwards. I like him very much - always have actually".&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dXB_-9NTVhA/WjHDdksj3AI/AAAAAAAAGnY/pdpK7I6-HCkHZmSbmNXl9lRAE3OpB70CwCLcBGAs/s1600/Just%2Ba%2BMinute_RT%2B070285.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="647" data-original-width="969" height="213" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dXB_-9NTVhA/WjHDdksj3AI/AAAAAAAAGnY/pdpK7I6-HCkHZmSbmNXl9lRAE3OpB70CwCLcBGAs/s320/Just%2Ba%2BMinute_RT%2B070285.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Parsons, Williams, Nimmo and Jones. <i>Radio Times </i>7 February 1985</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: inherit;">With Williams on board the show was increasingly played for laughs rather than just been a rules-based parlour game. His flamboyant style, his appeals to the audience, those elongated vowels and then rattling along at top speed became his game trademarks. Williams even unwittingly introduced some catchphrases that are remembered to this day and only recently were referenced by Paul Merton and Sheila Hancock: "I'm a cult figure". "I haven't come all the way from Great Portland Street...". "It's a disgrace" when, unreasonably to him, challenged or losing an appeal. And "we shouldn't have women on this show", initially aimed at the 'lovely Aimi Macdonald'. Kenny appeared on 346 radio episodes between 1968 and 1988.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In 1992 the programme celebrated its silver anniversary with a 2-part retrospective, <i>Silver Minutes</i>. This is part one from 20 July 1992 (though this is the commercially released version). </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtIVlNEY98E" width="420"></iframe> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The fourth member of what was seen for many years as the 'classic line-up' - was Peter Jones, who joined the show in 1971, again to fill a gap left by a busy Nimmo. He had a more laid back approach to the game and was often willing to sit back whilst the other fought it out only to buzz in with a very funny or acerbic comment. His talks always seemed to start with "well..." I recall. Peter made 326 appearances until 2000. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">That so-called classic line-up appeared together in just 38 episodes so there were always guest slots to fill. Some became semi-regulars and the longest-serving of these is Sheila Hancock who, like Nicholas Parsons spans the five decades, appearing on the second edition of the first series in December 1967 through to a couple of shows in the latest series, the 79th, this autumn.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is the second of the <i>Silver Minutes</i> programmes originally broadcast on 27 July 1992.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJKbEvLq7-o" width="420"></iframe> <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">With the gradual loss of Kenneth Williams in 1988 there was a vacancy for a regular player. Comedian Paul Merton had been an avid fan of the show for years and had recorded and constantly replayed episodes to himself. Convinced that he could contribute to the show he wrote to the then producer Edward Taylor. At the same time he'd appeared as a panellist on the TV game show <i>Scruples</i> on which Nick also appeared (BBC Genome would suggest this was the 30 October 1988 edition) and he mentioned how much he loved <i>Just a Minute</i>. Paul's flights of surrealist fancy and running gags opened up the show and in recent years, alongside that other semi-regular Gyles Brandreth, it has tended to be comedians on the panel. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ybgsvGXfuOM/WjHD5OjVe6I/AAAAAAAAGnc/3wiSxA_tGfIYoO5CBqKKC7B5rQV-He1pQCLcBGAs/s1600/Merton%252BParsons.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="900" height="160" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ybgsvGXfuOM/WjHD5OjVe6I/AAAAAAAAGnc/3wiSxA_tGfIYoO5CBqKKC7B5rQV-He1pQCLcBGAs/s320/Merton%252BParsons.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: inherit;">The programmes longevity can be put down to the fact that one, it is a simple concept and two, that it has slowly evolved. Nicholas Parsons, with a long history in the business has, to be fair, be very astute in recognising the fact that the show needed to change to survive. Indeed in his book on the programme he is very honest about the run-ins he had with Clement Freud who still wanted to play strictly by the rules as first laid down by Ian Messiter. Parsons recognised that much of the laughter comes from the challenges, whether valid or not. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The first series of <i>Just a Minute</i> that I committed to tape was the 14th that aired between December 1979 and March 1980. Playing alongside Williams, Nimmo, Jones and Freud were Sheila Hancock, Aimi Macdonald, Tim Rice, Patrick Moore, Lance Percival, Barry Cryer and John Junkin. Making their only appearances in the programme's history were Peter Cook, Bob Monkhouse, Rob Buckman and Kenny Everett. &nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is the first episode from series 14 from 11 December 1979.

"I enjoy the position of chairman so much", he says in next week's issue of the <i>Radio Times</i>. "It's the greatest effort of concentration of any job I have. I'm listening intently and can see the way people's minds are working when they have a subject. We, as professionals, make it look easy and sound fun, but it's an incredibly difficult game."&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">I can't do justice to the programme's 50 year history in such a short post so I can direct you to the superb <a href="http://just-a-minute.info/" target="_blank">Just a Minute website</a>.
