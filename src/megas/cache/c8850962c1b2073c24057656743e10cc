<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By <strong >Mitch Stolz</strong> for the <strong ><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/music-modernization-act-good-solution-songwriters-dont-combine-it-bad-copyright" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></strong></span></em></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">For the first time in six years, Congress is considering serious changes to copyright law. As you might imagine, those changes are a mixed bag for the public. One bill, the Music Modernization Act, would create a new system for compensating songwriters and music publishers when their songs are played on digital services. It solves a problem recognized by nearly everyone in the music space. And while the bill has some problematic text that needs fixing, it?s a good effort.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Unfortunately, the MMA has now been combined with a harmful bill, the ?CLASSICS Act,? which would create a new form of pseudo-copyright for recordings from before 1972, adding on new royalties and penalties without giving anything back to the public. And other dangerous bills could get added as amendments: the ?CASE Act? and the ?Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act.?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Music Modernization Act addresses a big problem in the music business: many songwriters and music publishers have trouble collecting royalties for the use of their songs for digital streaming. Today?s systems and organizations that administer these ?mechanical royalty? payments (for the reproduction and distribution of songs) are not up to the task. Millions of dollars in royalties go unclaimed. Several music publishers have tried to create a solution by brute force, filing lawsuits for billions of dollars under copyright?s draconian civil penalty regime.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The MMA would create a new licensing collective to gather data about who should be paid for the use of songs, and to distribute royalties, replacing the unpredictable litigation bazooka of statutory damages with a fairer system. That?s a copyright fix we can get behind.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The MMA does have some flaws. It has some language that seems to define audio streaming as a reproduction and a distribution under copyright law, even if no permanent copies are made. While that language refers only to music streaming, other copyright holders might use it to attack key court decisions that protect Internet video services and cloud computing. In addition, control of the licensing collective created by the bill is weighted rather heavily towards music publishers, not actual songwriters.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Still, these flaws are fixable. The same cannot be said for the CLASSICS Act, which creates new obstacles for users of old music. That Act would extend parts of federal copyright to cover sound recordings made before 1972, which are currently covered only by a patchwork of state laws. That means, for the first time, recordings made between 1923 and 1972 couldn?t be streamed on digital music services or Internet radio without a license, and failing to get one could leave the streamer liable for massive, unpredictable statutory damages.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Creating new barriers to the use of old creative works is not what copyright is for. Copyright is a bargain: authors and artists get limited, exclusive rights over their works as an incentive to create. In return, the public is enriched by new art and authorship and can use works in ways and times that fall outside the rightsholder?s zone of exclusivity. Creating new rights in recordings that have been around for 46 years or more doesn?t create any new incentives. It simply creates a new subsidy for rightsholders, most of whom are not the recording artists. The CLASSICS Act gives nothing back to the public. It doesn?t increase access to pre-1972 recordings, which are already played regularly on Internet radio stations. And it doesn?t let the public use these recordings without permission any sooner: state copyrights will continue until 2067, when federal law takes over fully.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The CLASSICS Act will put today?s digital music giants like Pandora and Sirius XM in a privileged position. Many of them already pay royalties for some pre-72 recordings as part of private agreements with record labels, on terms that simply won?t be available to smaller Web streamers like college and independent radio stations.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The CLASSICS Act will also make it much harder to hear significant recordings from the 1920s, ?30s, and ?40s. These recordings will still remain under copyright for as much as 144 years. But with the addition of federal rights and penalties, streaming those works would get a lot more risky. As decades follow decades, current rightsholders become ever more difficult to identify and locate. Even a conscientious streamer could face lawsuits from a musician?s distant heirs.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Copyright should not be used as a subsidy for rightsholders in old works, creating no new incentives or public access. Congress should not risk losing the benefits of the Music Modernization Act by tacking on the CLASSICS Act.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Ultimately, copyright law should benefit a broad public, including music fans. Creating more friction in copyright law inevitably leads to inconvenience and legal confusion for listeners. The further expansions of copyright law in the CLASSICS Act will bring even more frustrations for users in the form of confusion over why they can?t listen to an old favorite recording.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Nor should Congress add other bad ideas as amendments to the MMA. We?ve discussed here why the CASE Act, which would create a new ?small claims? tribunal at the Copyright Office, would supercharge the abusive business model of copyright trolling. And we?ve explained why the Register of Copyrights should remain an appointee of the Librarian of Congress, not an independent appointee. These proposals should not be combined with the valuable and widely supported Music Modernization Act.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">These days, my economist instincts tend to take a back seat to my <em >accountant</em> instincts whenever someone starts throwing sums of money around (years on the job will do that to you) and the first thing that caught my eye was that the 16.5% figure everyone?s quoting is for the <em >retail</em> amounts?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now, retail to accounting is what net is to residuals ? a fiction. What interests us isn?t what the customers are paying at the counter, but rather how much of that money winds up in our pocket. The retail figure has all sorts of third-party add-ons ? not least, the margins applied by retailers (including our favourite company: Spotify). However, the report helpfully supplies the wholesale revenue, as well.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It is this part of the equation I propose to focus on, since it is much closer to the actual money labels get to play with (including such niceties as paying royalties and promoting our music).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On the wholesale side, the picture is somewhat less rosy. Total revenue for 2017 is reported at $5.9 billion, about 13.5% up from 2016?s $5.2 billion. Not terrible, but not as good as we?re led to believe.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The other soundbite you?ll likely have heard is that the industry is back to 2008 levels. I?m not sure if that?s something to be particularly thrilled about ? that happens to be the year that I started writing this blog because I thought the industry was in the dumps with no end in sight. Ten years of doldrums sure changes ones perspective, don?t it?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Leaving that aside, I?ve a sneaky suspicion this bit of news isn?t actually true.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here?s where the economist instincts kick in again. Whenever we want to compare money amounts between two different points in time, it is imperative we do it in <em >real dollars</em> ? in other words: we have to account for inflation, because one dollar was worth more (in terms of purchasing power) in 2008 than it was last year.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Having tracked down the <a href="https://www.musicaememoria.com/docs/riaa-year-end-report-2008.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em >RIAA 2008 Year-End Shipment Statistics</em></a>, I see that the reported Total Value was $8,420.2 million ? slightly below the <em >nominal</em> value reported for last year.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But what?s that in real terms?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To the Inflation Calculator! Running the numbers, I find that 8.4 billion 2008 dollars is worth <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=8480.2&year1=200812&year2=201712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">9.94 billion 2017 dollars.</a></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So, no. We?re not back at 2008 revenues ? last year?s revenue was worth only 87% of the total for 2008.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With the aggregates out of the way, we can zoom in on some details. Eyeing the breakdown by format, we see that streaming is now the uncontested ruler at 65%. We can also readily see that this growth came about at least partly through cannibalizing unit sales ? especially in the permanent download sphere. All very much as predicted years ago. Downloads and physical sales now account for roughly the same portion of total revenue ? 15% and 17% respectively ? but since downloads are declining much faster than physical sales ? almost 25% v. not quite 4% ? its likely that physical will be with us long after downloads are a memory.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This shouldn?t come as a surprise to anyone. Streaming offers pretty much the exact same experience as listening to music files, so anyone who told you that streaming <em >wouldn?t</em> eat downloads was either clueless or telling porkies.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Physical, on the other hand, is? interesting. I have made it abundantly clear over the years that I am a fan and now I can demonstrate why.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Across the digital domain ? from subscription streaming to downloads ? we see unit sales changes track the revenue changes almost percentage point by percentage point. This is decidedly <em >not</em> the case with physical.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95c6dc4970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95c6dc4970b img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95c6dc4970b-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="3"></img></a>CD unit shipments may have declined by 10.3%, but revenue only fell 6.5%. Vinyl shipments grew 5.3%, but vinyl revenue grew 9.3%. Most notably, other physical (including such exotic formats as cassettes, vinyl singles, SACDs and DVD Audio) saw shipments decline around 5%, but revenue actually <em >grew</em> almost 20%.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">How do we explain such striking results? Elementary, My Dear Reader.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Ever since the iTunes Music Store launched, the industry had its digital pricing dictated to it by outside parties. Needless to say that neither Steve Jobs, back in the day, nor Daniel Ek these days, has our best interests at heart. With physical, the industry has a lot more to say in terms of pricing their products and this allows for revenue maximizing strategies that simply won?t be available in the streaming future everyone seems so set on.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This sets a cap on possible industry revenue, of course. As streaming accounts for an ever greater part of industry revenues, the more we are forced to accept the terms dictated to us. Also, we should always keep in mind that streaming <em >will</em> reach a saturation point. Once everyone has a subscription, there?s no more growth to be had, period. I sincerely doubt we?ll make back the post-Napster losses till then.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This future is not inevitable, no matter what anyone would have you think. Lest we forget, it is we ? the music industry in general ? that hold the keys to the kingdom. Folks like Spotify think they?ve built a valuable product, but the truth is that without our music it is worthless. We <em >can</em> set the terms ? if we so choose.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">That is, unless the streamers manage to convince legislators to enshrine their POS business model in an equally POS bit of legislation, such as the Music Modernization Act?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But that?s a story for another day.</span></p></div>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By <strong >Leonard Patterson</strong> of<strong > <a href="http://www.indiebandcoach.com/">IndieBandCoach</a></strong></span></em></span>
<div >
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It?s an interesting balance between you and your fans. They feed off of you as much as you feed off of them. And sometimes, just sometimes, if you?ve got an engaged group of people that have bought into your ?thing?, they might even know you better than you do yourself.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">All that aside, from a social media standpoint, it was never meant to be a replacement for real interaction, but a compliment. So one of the best ways to treat our glorious social media landscape isn?t as a channel to merely broadcast our thoughts and promote our next show, but more so as a place to converse with our followers and fans.</span></div>
<div > </div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >Social media is a method of conversation, </em></span></strong></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >not a replacement for it.</em></span></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So when you're having a quick conversation with someone in person, do you normally start with a broadcast? Or might it be a question? Even if it?s considered ?small talk?, a good habit to get into is asking your fans questions and giving them a chance to respond, interact, and engage.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Your challenge, should you choose to accept it: Ask your fan?s opinion to get objective feedback, spark up a conversation, and maybe even do some market research while you?re at it.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Here?s a quick list of social conversation prompts to start with?</strong></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ul >
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Where do you like to see live music?</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Which t-shirt design do you like the best??</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What?s your favorite song on our latest cd??</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Do you prefer to download music (iTunes, Amazon) or stream (Pandora, Spotify?)?</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What venue would you like to see us play??</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Which cd artwork would you pick for our new cd?</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What other bands do you like to see?</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Who?s your favorite (genre related to you) artist?</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95b55c2970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Image2-qmark" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95b55c2970b img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b7c95b55c2970b-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Image2-qmark"></img></a>What other questions have you used? And now ? what do you do with the results?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Some of the questions are just letting them into your process like if you have multiple merch designs you?re thinking about ? a new t-shirt or your iTunes cover art (see new Facebook poll options below). Yeh, you might already have a favorite, but why not give them a chance to give you some input? You never know what gems you?ll uncover and (heaven forbid), you get a negative response to the option you were originally thinking about.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em ><strong >If there?s one thing people have plenty of - it?s OPINIONS.</strong></em></span>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span></div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If someone gives you a venue recommendation, follow up with them and find out why they like it (and more importantly) if they?ve got a contact there. You never know who?s connected to gatekeepers in your area.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It?s happened on numerous occasions where we?d be in a conversation with someone and realize that we were only 1 ?warm? degree of separation away from an introduction to a talent buyer or committee chair.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the polls we would post on social media every few months was pretty simple and something we KNEW our folks would have an opinion on: ?what song(s) would you like to see us cover next??</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We obviously couldn?t fulfill all of the requests, but there were some awesome answers and we knew we had a winner when there was a song or two with multiple votes!</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59513970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Image3-checklist" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59513970c img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59513970c-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Image3-checklist"></img></a>And speaking of voting?</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Using Polls & Surveys</strong></span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you want to kick it up a notch, you could also think about creating a poll or survey. It shows your followers that you care about their opinions, which in turn helps to build trust and loyalty, which will help strengthen your brand (band) image.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are several tools that exist for you to get input and ask structured questions. Obviously, you can format them pretty easily inside a Facebook post.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you want to go a little deeper, a couple options that are easy to set up (and free) are Survey Monkey and Google Forms.</span> </div>
<div ><br ></br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Facebook has also made it suuuper easy to create polls on your music page.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e5955a970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img alt="Image4-createpoll" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e5955a970c img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e5955a970c-320wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image4-createpoll"></img></a></span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There?s even an option on your music page to create an <em >image poll</em>. Put two images side by side and have your fans vote!</span></div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59524970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img alt="Image5-imagepoll" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59524970c img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e59524970c-320wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image5-imagepoll"></img></a></span></div>
<div > </div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At the time of this being published, Facebook will only allow for two options. But regardless of what method you use, get creative and most importantly ? have fun.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Your fans want to see you succeed! They want to be a part of your success story and just need you to ask them the question (whatever that is). So don?t be afraid to get their attention by getting their input.</span></div>
<div > </div>
<div ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Conversation is the new connection. Ok, technically, it always has been, but we tend to forget stuff every now and then. Enjoy the journey!</span></div>

<h2 ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >STEP #1:</strong> Set Your Goals (Short term / Long term)</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When approaching a plan start with where you see yourself in 18 ? 24 months and work backwards</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Add goals for every 3 months 3, 6,9,12-month, etc.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">If you are a newbie at Social Media consult an expert to establish reasonable growth goals for your niche.</span></p>
<blockquote >
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >TIP:</strong> While you are at this don?t skip goals for your personal life too! As a wildly busy entrepreneur, it can be really easy to allow work to take over your life plans ? so build your life into your plan as much as possible.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >STEP #2:</strong> Identify Your Niche & Leaders in it!</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Choose 3-4 to start and get granular!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Remember ?Rock star? is not a niche but <a href="http://cyberprmusic.com/2013/08/21/case-study-darius-lux/?__hstc=185665142.f02af39b89a77036a2651459a565f5ef.1518725115544.1520543208629.1522097495768.4&__hssc=185665142.8.1522097495768&__hsfp=3357184988" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gluten-Free Rock Star</a> sure is! :-)</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Once you have identified each one, look for the thought leaders in each niche.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Look at what other thought leaders are doing and picture yourself collaborating with them (instead of competing!)</span><br ></br><br ></br></p>

<h2 ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >STEP #3:</strong> Create Your Signature Story</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >Start with: Why is the reason I want to do what I do?</strong></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Does it come to you because you saw someone in your life / family suffer and you could solve the problem?</span><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Does it come from divine inspiration?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Do you want to change the world by helping people?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">What?s your mission behind wanting to tell your story?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >TIP:</strong> Make sure you can tell your story in all formats ? short (think about a tweet), medium (think about a Facebook Post) and Long (think about your website or a talk)</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >TIP:</strong> Our Team Can Write one for you if this is not your forte. </span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >STEP #4:</strong> Create Your Customer Archetype</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Start by giving yourself at least a full hour to really think this through! Nailing this is key!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">If you get stuck or if this all feels like too much <a href="http://cyberpr.com/what-we-do/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we would be delighted to write a full marketing plan for you</a>.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">1. Use Wordpress</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">2. Don?t spend more than $1,500</span></p>

<h2 ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong >STEP #6:</strong> Attend To The 6 Rooms of Your Social Media House (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Blog, Pinterest, and Your Newsletter)</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">To help you spring into action, I have put together this bulleted attack plan so you can work your way down the list and implement!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM ONE: FACEBOOK</u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Outline your desires, angles, news, updates and content strategy (remember to diversify your content and NOT just self promote).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Optimize your Facebook Fan Page & Personal Page (if you use it for promotion) to more effectively brand, and market to your customer base and obtain deeper engagement.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Create relevant status updates for your Fan Page and interact with fans on your behalf. Cross populate blog posts and Tweets.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Monitor Insights (analytics) to make sure status updates are posted at optimal times, e.g. when followers are most active and responsive.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Strategize on special opportunities such as contests, newsletter sign up drives, E for M (email for media), or similar widgets and charity tie-ins.</span></p>
<p ><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM TWO: TWITTER </u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Think about your tweet angles, news, updates and content strategy (mix it up!).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Add hundreds of new followers each month ? find people you like and see who follows them then run down the list and follow all (don?t think!).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Tweet updates based on your personal interests, and angles (charities, politics, hobbies, etc.).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Ensure followers are engaged with you by sending @?s, RTs, and DM?s.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use Crowdbooster.com to monitor analytics to make sure tweets go out at the optimal times, e.g. when followers are most active and responsive.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Strategize special opportunities such as contests, newsletter sign- up drives and charity tie-ins.</span></p>
<p ><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM THREE: YOUTUBE </u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Go over your desires, angles, news, updates, and come up with a content strategy to create content (i.e will you need to hire a videographer etc.) and calls to action</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Drive views to your channel by cross-populating your videos onto ?your Twitter, Facebook, and blog.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Engage all of your new followers and ensure that you are following, subscribing and having two-way conversations when they leave comments</span><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Strategize special opportunities such as contests, newsletter sign- up widget and charity tie-ins.</span></p>
<p ><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM FOUR: BLOG</u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Schedule a monthly strategy session with yourself to organize and integrate your likes, interests, and unique story so that your online voice and brand gets communicated effectively on your blog.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Create ideas that you want to blog about that are relevant, consistent, and tie in with your overall brand and message.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Ask fellow peers to write guest posts to add on a biweekly or monthly basis (depending on desired strategy).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Drive views to your blog by cross posting bit.ly links onto your Twitter and Facebook pages and pin them on Pinterest.</span><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">?</span></p>
<p ><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM FIVE: PINTEREST </u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Pinterest is retaining and engaging users as much as two to three times as efficiently as Twitter.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Engage with potential fans on this addictive platform but repin what they post, repin at least 10 images a week</span></p>
<p ><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong ><u >ROOM SIX: YOUR NEWSLETTER</u></strong></span><br ></br><br ></br><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">If you don?t have one commit to starting one. Write it every month and focus on adding new people every month. Use Mail Chimp. It rocks.</span><br ></br><br ></br></p>

Walk and the Universal Music Group label ?have mutually agreed to part ways,? according to a statement from Republic obtained by Variety. </span></p> 
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Walk was accused of sexual harassment by five female employees of the label and of two Sony Music labels, former workplaces for Walk. </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">He was placed on leave by Republic Records after allegations arose. </span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">A rep from UMG declined to elaborate to Variety beyond the statement.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Accusations against Walk first appeared in January when Tristan Coopersmith, who worked with Walk at Columbia Records, wrote an open letter accusing him of sexual harassment. That was followed by allegations made by four women in a Rolling Stone article. Walk has since retained attorney Patricia Glaser, who is also representing Harvey Weinstein, Variety noted.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Coopersmith said to Variety, ?I applaud all the women who shared their truth and I am gratified that Universal created a safe process for them to do so. This behavior in the workplace will only stop when we band together, unafraid. TimesUp.?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Walk was a judge on ?The Four,? a singing contest show, but was cut from the season finale after allegations arose. A source at Republic told Variety that Walk?s office still looked the way he left it when he was placed on leave.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Walk?s career as a radio promotion executive is a long one, from the early success of New Kids on the Block to becoming president of Republic Records in 2016.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">__________________________</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >Guest post by <strong >Katie Sawyer</strong> of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/myths-perfect-ticket-price-ds00/">Eventbrite</a></em></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Bad news: there?s no one-size-fits-all way to price your event, and no secret formula for netting endless profits.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But that doesn?t mean there aren?t steps you can take to find the right price. The first of which is to question the assumptions that may be standing in your way of creating smart ticket pricing strategy that will help you drive a profit.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here are three myths about setting the perfect price that might be holding you back.</span></p>
<h2 data-nav-title="Myth #1: You can?t find out your attendees? perceived value" data-url-key="eb-nav-myth-1-you-cant-find-out-your-attendees-perceived-value"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Myth #1: You can?t find out your attendees? perceived value </span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff70d9970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff70d9970d img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff70d9970d-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="1"></img></a>The best strategy to price an event is to determine how valuable your attendees think your event is ? and deliver at that price. Luckily, there are ways you can learn if you?re providing enough value for your attendees to justify your price.</span></p>
<ul >
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Research your competition.</strong> A Google search is a great place to start your research. Use relevant search terms like ?beer festival,? ?craft brewery event? or ?beer tasting? ? or whatever equivalent is applicable to your event. Check those event?s ticket prices and see if yours are in the same range.</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Survey your audience.</strong> With feedback surveys, you can ask attendees what they want from a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/vip-package-ds00/">VIP experience</a> or why they would attend a beer festival. When you know what your attendees value, the more you?ll be able to show why your ticket price is worth it.</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Experiment with your ticket types.</strong> If you?re using a ticketing technology partner with full reporting capabilities, you?ll be able to see how different ticket types perform ? so you can quickly assess what offerings attendees find the most valuable. Low VIP sales may indicate your price is too high, while outsized early bird sales may actually indicate you need to reduce your discount.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-nav-title="Myth #2: Attendees won?t pay for higher-priced tickets" data-url-key="eb-nav-myth-2-attendees-wont-pay-for-higher-priced-tickets"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Myth #2: Attendees won?t pay for higher-priced tickets</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Ticket price tops the list of millennials? considerations when choosing to attend festivals, but that doesn?t mean they?re not willing to pay for a memorable experience. In a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/academy/food-and-drink-millennial-magnet/">recent study</a>, half of millennials reported that they were willing to spend $36-50 per ticket to a food and beverage festival.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When deciding whether to invest in an expensive ticket, your customer assesses <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/academy/pricing-your-event-value-analysis-workbook/">how much value</a> they?ll get from the VIP experience. Use these checkpoints as a gut check to see if your price is too high.</span></p>
<ul >
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your event?s value is higher than your competitors and priced higher, you have a leg up on the competition. Check your ticket sales ? if you?re selling out your event, you know you are delivering value at a price attendees are willing to pay.</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your event?s value is higher than your competitors, but priced lower, you?d be wise to raise your price. You?re leaving potential money on the table!</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your event?s value is equal to your competitors and priced lower, you could benefit from raising your prices. It?s nice to have competitive prices, but if attendees are willing to pay a higher price, don?t be shy about charging more.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-nav-title="Myth #3: You can?t increase the value your attendees perceive" data-url-key="eb-nav-myth-3-you-cant-increase-the-value-your-attendees-perceive"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Myth #3: You can?t increase the value your attendees perceive </span></h2>
<div class="tm-click-to-tweet"> </div>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you want to charge more than attendees are currently willing to pay, you have to increase the value attendees perceive from your event. Here are a few tips to help you maximize your ticket value ? and increase your profit:</span></p>
<ul >
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Offer early entry.</strong> Let?s say 100 of your attendees are willing to pay an additional $10 for early entry to your event. With minimal effort on your part, you enhance the experience for 100 of your attendees ? and add extra profit to your bottom line.</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Experiment with price.</strong> According to Nels Gilbreth, VP of Pricing & Monetization at Eventbrite, most organizers increase ticket prices three times throughout their onsale. Once one price point sells out, the perceived value of tickets rises because potential attendees understand the scarcity. For example, if you know that your target market values your event at $60, use early-bird pricing to sell slightly cheaper tickets at $55, then increase the price to $60, and finally raise the price one more time.</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Advertise discounts</strong>. Limited-time flash sales give prospective event goers a reason to buy right away when they?d otherwise be more likely to bookmark your event for later. Creating urgency around your event is a great way to boost perceived value and excite potential attendees. And ultimately, you?ll sell more tickets and increase your profit</span></li>
<li ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong >Work with your ticketing partner.</strong> Your ticketing platform works with event organizers day in and day out. They can help you identify opportunities or challenges in your current pricing strategy.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">________________________________</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >Guest post by <strong >David Lowery</strong> of <a href="https://thetrichordist.com/2018/03/26/spotify-is-deeply-integrated-with-facebook-how-safe-is-your-streaming-data/">The Trichordist</a></em></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The public has woken up to the fact that Facebook is a spying and privacy violating machine.   Governments in half a dozen countries have announced some sort of investigation into the company.  What most people don?t realize is that Facebook is not unique.  Virtually every free digital app is spying on you and sharing that data with 3rd parties.  This includes the music streaming service Spotify.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">However Spotify is unique.  More than most other services Spotify and the Facebook platform are heavily integrated. When you sign up for Spotify from a web browser, you are encouraged to sign up using your Facebook login so they can associate your account with your profile.  To illustrate just how integrated the companies are when I was offered a free premium account by Spotify (a sort of peace offering) somehow linking it to my email address reactivated my deleted Facebook account! I am not kidding.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">And over the years many other people have complained about the tight integration between Facebook and Spotify. Particularly bothersome to many folks is that they often ended up sharing playlists, or songs they didn?t really intend to share.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are probably two reasons for this.  The first is probably relatively harmless.  Major Facebook and Spotify shareholders overlap. Most notable are funds connected to Sean Parker (of Napster fame) and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bono-defends-spotify-lets-experiment-lets-see-what-works-20141107">U2?s Bono</a> (<a href="http://www.elevation.com/ep_it.asp?id=112">Elevation Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/04/bono-joins-new-3-billion-tpg-investment-fund-as-special-advisor.html">TPG</a>). But less famous names and funds share investments in the company.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But the more important reason they are so tightly integrated is to harvest data.  Folks who think Spotify is just a music platform are mistaken.  The overwhelming number of streams on Spotify are on the ad supported tier.  It is here that Spotify trades OUR songs for YOUR Data. And much of this data goes straight into the Facebook data mining machine. As far as I can tell this has been going since Spotify first launched in the US.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong ><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"in some countries </span></strong></span></p>

<article class="post-content" data-post-length="7277">
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I?m still about 300 emails behind from what I missed at SXSW.</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I completely forgot to turn on the vacation responder when I left. Only a couple people freaked out at my delay. When I'm at a music conference it's impossible to keep up with any work not pertaining directly to the conference.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is probably a good time to remind you that if someone doesn?t respond to your email right away it doesn?t mean they hate you. It means they couldn?t get to your email in this moment. Oh, and don't email anyone in the industry during big music conferences and festivals.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The key to this industry is polite persistence.</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow up! I recommend waiting a week after the first email. Then 5 days. Then 3 days. Then daily. Keep it friendly and polite. Keep going until you get a response.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This was my 4th year in a row at SXSW. I was down at the festival in 2007 playing a couple shitty unofficial showcases that did absolutely nothing for my career, but that was mostly because I didn?t know how to leverage the experience and didn?t have an artist wristband or badge.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are right ways and wrong ways to do SXSW. More on this in a minute.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The past 4 years have been different. This year, I spoke on a panel about management, interviewed VÉRITÉ at the AWAL house, performed the Boomfantasy Showcase of Dreams presented by DistroKid, did a book signing (the book store sold out of all 50 books they had on hand!) and had an Ari?s Take meet up.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">SXSW is unlike every other music festival. Because it?s not really what you think of when you think music festival. It?s nothing like Cochella, Lollapalooza, Bonoroo or any of those Camp festivals. In <a href="http://smarturl.it/aribook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the book</a> I call festivals like SXSW, Street festivals. If you?ve never been, well, it?s 1 part conference and 300 parts music.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Most bands who come down play as many possible showcases as they can in a 4-5 day span. I've seen artists bang out 10 shows in 4 days. Some showcases are official (officially sanctioned by SXSW and some are unofficial - just playing in another venue not officially sanctioned).</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Since everyone in the music industry is down there during this time, you should play as many shows as you can and invite everyone to every one and hope they get out to one. This festival isn't as much about winning new fans as it is about making connections for your career.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your goal is to get an agent or a manager or a label. Well, all these people are down there. So identify the actual people (like, their names) who you want. And make sure they get out to at least one of your shows. This is the research that goes into your preparation.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The convention center is where the conference portion of the festival happens.</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Every day from 10am - 6pm or so tons and tons of panels and speakers talking about the biz of music. This year I only had time to hit one session other than my own. It was an Instagram employee discussing how musicians can build and leverage their Instagram accounts.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I was a bit disappointed with the session because she was mostly highlighting how superstars are using Instagram and she seemed pretty clueless as to how artists actually grow their accounts within Instagram (like all the incredible Instagram musicians that <a href="http://instagram.com/@Pickup_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@Pickup_</a> and <a href="https://aristake.com/post/@pickupjazz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@pickupjazz</a> feature). I would consider myself an Instagram super user and nothing she discussed was news to me. I think she was gearing her talk towards beginning users.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img alt="" height="424" src="https://aristake.com/posts/images/instagram-sxsw.JPG" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="565"></img></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">She mentioned that all Business accounts now have the swipe up (link) feature in Stories. However, last I heard it was only for accounts that are verified or have at least 10,000 followers. So I asked the question during the Q&A. She assured me it was all business accounts. But my instagram isn?t verified and has just over 6,000 followers and I don?t have it. So I went up to her afterwards and asked her about it. She gave me her private Instagram account and told me to DM her when she was back in the office.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Boom!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is the best part about the sessions. There are tons of amazing people at the conference portion. The movers and shakers of the industry. Yes you can learn extremely valuable information from (some) of the panels and sessions, but whether you walk away with great info or not, <strong >always always always go up to the speakers after the session</strong>and get their business card or contact info. If they will take yours, give them yours.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I spoke with an artist friend of mine who went to a panel on playlisting at a different conference last year. After the session, she went up to the person who curated a few official Spotify playlists. She handed the curator a napkin with her artist name and song title listed on it and said it would fit the playlists she curated (because the curator discussed them during the panel) and<strong > the following week her song was included in the playlist with millions of followers - to date she now has 6M streams on that 1 song.</strong>All thanks to being proactive at a music conference.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is exactly <a href="http://aristake.com/post/how-to-get-your-music-on-npr">how I got</a> my song played on NPR?s All Songs Considered to 14 million people.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But SXSW (or "SouthBy") is so much more than the conference. There is music EVERYWHERE. Every bar, restaurant, cafe, bookstore, there is live music. You can?t walk down the street without hearing bands blasting out of every crevasse.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img alt="Lawrence at SXSW" height="424" src="https://aristake.com/posts/images/lawrence-sxsw.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="566"></img></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The first day there I was able to catch one of my favorite bands out today, <strong ><a href="http://lawrencetheband.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lawrence</a>.</strong> I?ve caught nearly every one of their LA performances and saw them at Bonnaroo and SXSW the past couple years. I?ve gotten to know their incredible manager <strong >BJ Olin</strong> over the past year or so. This year at Lawrence's set at the StubHub sponsored show, we were dancing, drinking and singing along. It was at a BBQ joint so there was free Brats. Major plus. A couple nights later my manager friend Andrew and I ran into him at another bar and we started talking about Lawrence?s upcoming tour. He said he just locked in an East Coast opener and I asked who he had for LA. He said he was still working on it and I told him that my new funk project would love to do it, and, of course, would pull a crowd. He told us to send him the record. So on Monday Andrew sent him the record and on Tuesday I heard that we got the opening slot! For the Teragram Ballroom - which is a 700 cap venue!</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you?re into funk/soul/R&B and in LA you?re not going to want to miss this show. And you?ll get to see my new band, <a href="http://brassrootsdistrict.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brassroots District,</a> first show! The show will sellout and tickets are pretty cheap. <a href="https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1008243087-brassroots-district-at-teragram-ballroom?came_from=267">Join us!</a></span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1008243087-brassroots-district-at-teragram-ballroom?came_from=267"><img alt="Brassroots District and Lawrence at the Teragram in Los Angeles" src="https://aristake.com/posts/images/BRD-Teragram-2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></img></a></span></p>
<br ></br>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But anyway! Back to SXSW?.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have a badge or a wristband you can get into the official venues. Some venues are ?official? and some aren?t. You wouldn?t really know by walking down the street which are which. But typically the biggest shows are in the official venues and you need a wristband or badge to get in.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Yes there are huge shows there. The name acts. Drake showed up last year. The Roots have a jam most years. Keith Urban played this year. But it?s best to avoid the gigantic shows. You most likely won?t be able to get in (even if you have a badge) and if you do, it will be uncomfortably packed in there.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">You?ll make deeper, longer lasting connections at the smaller shows. Or in line at a taco truck. Or at any random bar/party.</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">That?s the thing. So many people in the industry are in Austin during this week that nearly everyone you talk to is in the industry and is probably a good connection. Strike up conversations with EVERYONE. This is not a time to be bashful.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">RSVP to EVERY party.</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is how you eat and drink for free at SXSW. And make some of the most meaningful connections. This is a <a href="https://unofficialsxguide.com/sxsw-rsvp-list/">good list</a> to start with. And Google around for Twitter accounts to follow for parties.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">SXSW is over. But there are many more music conferences coming up like the <strong >ASCAP Expo</strong> which I will be at. It?s a great conference that I?ve been to the previous 4 years also. This is geared much more towards songwriters and producers. This year they have some big names speaking like <strong >St. Vincent, Meghan Trainor, Jason Mraz, JoJo, Dan Wilson, Betty Who</strong> and yours truly.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are lots of great masterclasses on songwriter, royalties, production, sync licensing, and the business overall. You can use the code ARISTAKE to get $30 off if you?re not an ASCAP member (if you are an ASCAP member you already get this discount). To clarify, you don?t need to be an ASCAP member to attend the Expo. Register <a href="http://smarturl.it/ascap-AT-2018">here</a></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When you?re there, come say hi.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When going to any networking event or other music conference, remember to make real connections, collect (and hand out) business cards or email addresses from everyone, always follow up the following week when the dust has settled, and remember to...wait for the cheese....have fun!</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But seriously. This is why we're doing all of this crazy shit anyways ain't it?</span></p>

<div ><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">TalentAI monitors billions of data points each day from sources such as Spotify and social networks to deliver trending intelligence on emerging artists to the A&R and talent scouting teams at labels, publishers, promoters and marketers.</span></div>

<div ><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Much like TalentAI, WMG's <a href="http://sodatone.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sodatone</a> combines streaming, social and touring data with the power of machine learning and then identifies unsigned talent by tracking early predictors of success, such as the loyalty and engagement of a growing fan-base, and the potential virality of a track or demo.</span></div>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">____________________________</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >Guest post by <strong >Patrick McGuire</strong> of the <a href="https://www.tunecore.com/blog/2018/03/consider-signing-label.html">TuneCore Blog</a></em></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[<strong >Editors Note:</strong> <em >This article was written by Patrick McGuire.</em>]</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The music industry has undergone an impressive comeback over the last two years, but that?s little consolation for artists who continue to struggle to find ways to make ends meet in a post-album world. There are plenty of bright spots to be found for new and small artists in the current music climate, but the landscape surrounding the music industry remains as volatile as ever.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With so much uncertainty accompanying serious music career today, something that?s managed not to change much is the hallowed status of the record label. Lots of artists still have it seared in their minds that all of their musical and financial problems could be solved if they could get picked up by a label.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Sadly, this unfounded reverence for record labels gets many a promising artist into big trouble. Signing with a label is great for some bands and disastrous for others. So, how do you know if it?s the right decision for you?</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Figure out what you can accomplish on your own</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A burgeoning DIY culture in music with increasingly better tools for promotion and music production ? alongside less favorable deals for artists ? might make some musicians rethink signing up with a label. When deciding whether to sign with a record label or not, you should always consider what you?re getting out of the deal. What can a label do for you that you can?t do for yourself? Once you have a good idea of what the label in question can do for your music, do your best to find out how good it is at supporting its artists and more importantly, how much it?s going to cost you.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In response to competing in a world of perpetually diminishing album sales, some labels now ink deals designed to ensure they always turn a profit at the cost of the artist. This means that going with the wrong label could leave you <a href="https://www.tunecore.com/blog/2018/01/want-record-deal-legally-ensure-artist-can-even-sign-one.html">on the hook</a> when it comes to paying for recording an album or contracting an expensive firm to facilitate a PR campaign. Even worse, though, is the fact that a bad record deal could leave you not only in debt but also in a position where a label owns the rights to your music for years.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As nice as it is to think that signing with a label can make every band?s dreams become reality, it?s just not true. But that doesn?t mean you should slam the door every time a label comes knocking. There?s plenty of examples of record labels launching and sustaining an artist?s career. But no two record labels are created equal, and discernment is the only way to tell if one is worth your time.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What exactly is a music label, anyway?</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you?re relatively new to making music, you might not realize it yet, but in theory, anyone and anything can be a music label if they call itself one.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Everything from multi-million dollar taste-making corporate machines down to your little brother?s fledgling Soundcloud roster of electronic artists are now being called labels, though what they can actually do for artists is drastically different. If you?re trying to decide whether to sign with a label, it?s important to make sure you?re working with a label that has the capitol, influence and connections to take your music where you want it to go.</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">How to spot a thriving label</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The difference between faux-labels from real ones is the value they provide to their artists. The best way to gauge a label?s legitimacy is to see what the artists on their roster are up to. If bands on a prospective label aren?t touring and releasing new music, then chances are the label in question isn?t doing much to help their artists succeed. Another metric of a label?s reach and effectiveness is how many plays their artists are consistently getting over music platforms.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In short, if the bands on a label?s roster aren?t at a level you want to get to, what?s the point in signing with them?</span></p>
<h3 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Why artists need to ask, ?What?s in it for me??</span></h3>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e67c4f970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e67c4f970c img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201b8d2e67c4f970c-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="2"></img></a>Again, you should only consider signing with a label if there?s something they can do for you that can?t already do yourself. Your music might be amazing, but people who run labels are most interested in turning a profit and making a living. This means that in return for help releasing and promoting your music, most any label you work with is going to expect a lot from you in terms of money, exclusive rights to your music and so on. When artists sign over the rights to their music, they should be getting something incredibly valuable in return.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you come to the conclusion that it?s just not the right time for you to team up with a label, try not to get too disappointed. Finding real success in music is still a notably tough gig, but tools designed to help artists record and promote their own music are getting better and better. There?s a huge sense of empowerment and creative freedom for bands who find success in music by going it alone.</span></p>

<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em >Guest post by <strong >Hugh McIntyre</strong> of the <a href="https://www.tunecore.com/blog/2018/03/5-tips-for-making-your-email-newsletter-more-visually-appealing.html">TuneCore Blog</a></em></span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[<strong >Editors Note:</strong> <em >This article was written by Hugh McIntyre. Read the first installment in <a href="https://www.tunecore.com/blog/2018/03/5-reasons-email-newsletter-still-good-idea.html">this two-part series here.</a></em>]</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Many people have all but given up entirely on email newsletters, and that?s a mistake <a href="https://www.tunecore.com/blog/2018/03/5-reasons-email-newsletter-still-good-idea.html">for many reasons.</a> They are still read by millions of people, and they can be a fantastic way to reach out to every kind of fan and let them know everything that?s going on in your career, from upcoming tour dates to new releases to simply what you?ve been up to.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the best ways to stay in people?s inboxes and to keep them from clicking that unsubscribe button is to make your email as visually appealing as possible.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If your newsletter is just a plain white background and black text with nothing else, you?re in some serious trouble. There are many services that will help you put together an awesome newsletter, and while you?re messing around with some of them (a quick Google search will present you with tons of options), keep these tips in mind if you want your message to be easy on the eye.</span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1. Color Rules</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is the most obvious way to make your email newsletter more interesting, and if you?re not already using color?what are you doing? Utilizing color in your messages is fun, but you should give it a bit of thought before you throw some shades together and hit send. What colors mix well? How many do you want to be using (hint: it?s probably fewer than you think)? Where in the email should they be featured?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Do some research about newsletter best practices and play around with color schemes before you mail anything. Stay away from too much colored text, unless in special instances, and don?t start thinking that just because something is colorful it will capture people?s attention and they?ll click or read on. Too much of a good thing might actually do the opposite.</span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2. Images</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Maybe I should have listed this item first, because what says ?visually appealing? more than an actual picture? Adding images helps break up the text, illustrates better than any words can, and they can make the entire message much more enjoyable to scroll through. These images can be of anything, and you should think outside the box here.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Posting pics of you and your band, both staged and live, are great, but what else can you use? Maybe something from the studio, or behind the scenes at a video shoot? Adding in content people can?t get anywhere else is a great way to keep people sign up?and you should make sure they know they?ll be seeing things nobody else will if they keep receiving your messages. It might not convince everyone to hand over their email addresses, but every little added benefit helps!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">While photos do certainly make for a better newsletter, don?t think all you need to do is throw a bunch of pics into an email and send it out. Email was still made for words, and you?ll want to intelligently employ both in a way that keeps people scrolling down the page and which conveys the info you need to get across.</span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3. White Space</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I can?t believe I have to include this, but I have seen so many artists go another, less visually-appealing route, I feel the need to call this out. In an email filled with text, links, and photos, choosing a white background is best.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I can understand the temptation to pick a color or go with black in order to stand out, but take a look at examples online of those who have tried this before, and you?ll see that for the most part, it just doesn?t work.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are ways to include some lightly tinted backgrounds here and there, and if you think long and hard about the design choices you?re making, colorful backings can be a fun way to separate different sections of your newsletter?but I warn you, be careful. I personally am immediately turned off when I see color combinations that don?t work, especially when one of them is taking up most of the page I?m looking at.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Many of the same rules that apply to creating and designing a web page people want to look at work for emails as well, so before you send something particularly jarring and ugly into people?s inboxes, think twice and maybe read some blogs about what shades are the best.</span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">4. Use Images As Links</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the biggest reasons you?ll be composing and mailing a newsletter at all is because you want people to click out of the email you spent so much time putting together to consume something of yours. That something could be a new song or video, or perhaps you want them to purchase a new t-shirt you?ve released or buy tickets to an upcoming show. You?ll likely push all of these things, and you?ll want them to click a link to find their way to another page.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead of simply turning a piece of text into a link, why not ask people to click on an image?</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have a new music video, take a screenshot and include that.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">More merch coming into your store? Don?t just tell people, show them!</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">People will spend more time looking at an interesting, bright, colorful image, and chances are they?ll be more likely to click it as well. You can also hyperlink some text, but don?t make that your only option!</span></p>
<h2 ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">5. Create A Header</span></h2>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff4fe8970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff4fe8970d img-responsive" src="http://www.hypebot.com/.a/6a00d83451b36c69e201bb09ff4fe8970d-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="2"></img></a>A quick look at almost any worthwhile email newsletter (or website, for that matter) will immediately show you that a header is necessary. They can pull the whole project together, add a splash of color (and satisfy the want to color in the background), and they immediately set the reader up to know what they are getting into.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is a marketing message, and while that may turn some people off, it?s best to be upfront about what you?re sending. Don?t trick people into scrolling through your entire email, just make it visually appealing and ensure that the content is worthwhile and you?ll see some fair results.</span></p>
<p ><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Many people don?t think of a header because they don?t exist in most emails. You don?t include them when replying to messages or when sending missives to friends, family, or colleagues, but newsletters are different, and you?ll be wise to include one.</span></p></div>
