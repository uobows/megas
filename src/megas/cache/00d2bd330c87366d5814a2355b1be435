<p>Mardas arrived after McCartney had left. He pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. In an attempt to silence his criticism, according to Mardas, the Maharishi offered Mardas money to build a high-powered radio station. Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi had, in her words, "too much interest in public recognition, celebrities and money" for a spiritual man. Cynthia Lennon, Cooke de Herrera and authors such as Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi; in a statement published in The New York Times in 2010, Mardas denied that this was the case.

The contract was negotiated by Horn and John Farrow was scheduled to direct the film. Horn expected that Donovan, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Mia Farrow would appear in it.

<p>Paul McCartney, Jane Asher and Neil Aspinall left Rishikesh on this day for England, having spent more than a month studying meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.</p>
<p>I came back after four or five weeks knowing that was like my allotted period, thinking, No, well, no, I won't go out and become a monk but it was really very interesting and I will continue to meditate and certainly feel it was a very rewarding experience.</p>
<p>They touched down back in the UK the following morning, arriving at London Airport. Paul and Jane spoke briefly to reporters at the airport.</p>
<p>Q: Well you look very happy. Do you feel better after five weeks of meditation?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yes, yes, I feel a lot better, except for the flight, you know. That's quite long. I'm a bit shattered, but the meditation is great!</p>
<p>You sit down, you relax, and then you repeat a sound to yourself. It sounds daft, but it's just a system of relaxation, and that's all it is. There's nothing more to it. We meditated for about five hours a day in all. Two hours in the morning and maybe three hours in the evening, and then, for the rest of the time, we slept, ate, sunbathed and had fun.</p>
<p>Q: One Indian MP accused the camp where you stayed as being an espionage centre, and you, in fact, as being a spy for the West.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yes, it's true. Yes, we are spies. The four of us are spies. Actually, I'm a reporter and I joined The Beatles for that very reason. The story is out next week in a paper which shall be nameless.</p>
<p>Q: Jane, did you go for a holiday or did you go to meditate as well?</p>
<p>Jane Asher: Oh, to meditate.</p>
<p>Q: And what effect did it have on you? This, I presume, is your first big meditation experience?</p>
<p>Jane Asher: Yes. I think it calms you down. It's hard to tell because it was so different, you know, the life out there. It'd be easy to tell now that I'm back, or when we're doing ordinary things, to see just what it does.</p>
<p>Q: We've heard about the extreme poverty that exists in India. Presumably you saw some of that?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yes, oh yes. I don't equate it, you know, because it's nothing to do with it, you know. The idea is to stop poverty at its root. You see, if we just give handouts to people, it'll just stop the problems for a day, or a week, you know. But, in India, there's so many people, you really need all of America's money to pour into India to solve it, you know. So, you've got to get to the cause of it and persuade all the Indians to start working and, you know, start doing things. Their religions, it's very fatalistic, and they just sit down and think, 'God said, this is it, so it's too bad to do anything about it.' The Maharishi's trying to persuade them that they can do something about it.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A lot of people are going to say that I left because I was disillusioned by it all but that just isn't so. The Academy is a great place and I enjoyed it a lot. I still meditate every day for half an hour in the morning and half an hour every evening and I think I'm a better person for it. I'm far more relaxed than I have ever been. You know, if you're working very hard and things are a bit chaotic, you get all tensed up and screwed up inside. You feel as if you have to break something or hit someone. But if you spend a short while in the mornings and evenings meditating, it completely relaxes you, and it's easier to see your way through problems. If everyone in the world started meditating, then the world would be a much happier place.</div>

<p>Less than two weeks after their arrival, Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen left Rishikesh to return to England.</p>
<p>The couple were unhappy at having to spend time away from their children. Additionally, Ringo found the spicy food disagreed with him - an intolerance caused by a childhood bout of peritonitis.

<p>It's all a bit hard to remember now. I was only there for two weeks, then I left. I wasn't getting what I thought I would out of it.</p>
<p>The food was impossible for me because I'm allergic to so many different things. I took two suitcases with me, one of clothes and the other full of Heinz beans (there's a plug for you). Then one morning the guys who were dealing with the food said, 'Would you like some eggs?' And I said, 'Oh yeah, sure,' and the next morning they said it again. I thought, 'Oh yeah, great - things are looking up.'</p>
<p>Then I saw them burying the shells. That was the first of several incidents that made me think that it was not what I thought it would be. You weren't supposed to have eggs inside this religious and spiritual ashram. I thought: 'What do you mean, you're burying the shells? Can't God see that too?'</p>
<p>We came home because we missed the children. I wouldn't want anyone to think we didn't like it there. I said it was like Butlins holiday camp, we had learnt by then that you could say anything and they'd print it. It was a good experience - it just didn't last as long for me as it did for them.</p>

<p>The arrival of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in Delhi was quite different from the journey taken by John Lennon and George Harrison a few days earlier.</p>
<p>The world's press was now aware of The Beatles' presence in India, and cameramen and reporters were on hand as they disembarked. The flight from London had lasted 20 hours, and the group was understandably exhausted upon their arrival.</p>
<p>They were met in Delhi by their assistant Mal Evans, and Raghvendra from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh. Garlands of red and yellow flowers were placed around the visitors' necks.</p>
<p>Starr was suffering pain in his arm following inoculation injections, and the party set off for a hospital. Their driver, however, lost his way and drove down a dead end in a field, along with the press convoy. One local reporter eventually led them to the hospital.</p>
<p>Afterwards they began the 150-mile journey to Rishikesh. The Academy of Transcendental Meditation was situated 150 feet above the Ganges, and was surrounded by mountainous jungles.</p>
<p>There was an Indian driver and Raghvendra from the camp in front and me and Jane Asher in the back and it was long and it was dusty and it was not a very good car and it was one of those journeys, but great and exciting. I remember these Indian guys talking in what was obviously an Indian language and I was starting to doze off in the car in the back because once you were two hours into the journey the tourism had worn off a little. It was fascinating seeing naked holy men and the kind of thing you just don't see unless it's late-night Soho, and the ones you tend to see in Soho tend to be covered in shit and very drunk. I slipped into sleep, a fitful back-of-the-car sort of sleep. It was quite bumpy, and the guys were chattering away, but in my twilight zone of sleeping it sounded like they were talking Liverpool. If you listened closely, it so nearly slid into it. There was like a little segue into very fast colloquial Liverpool. And I was thinking, Uh, where the fuck am I? What? Oh, it's Bengali, and I would just drop off again. 'Yabba yabba, are yer comin' oot then, lad?' It was a strange little twilight experience. It was a long journey. (Paul McCartney)</p>

<p>Just days before they were due to fly to India to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, The Beatles recorded Hey Bulldog, a brand new John Lennon song, during the filming of a promotional clip for Lady Madonna.</p>
<p>The group gathered in Abbey Road's Studio Three at 4pm to be filmed by NEMS employee Tony Bramwell. While there, The Beatles decided to put their time to good use, and recorded the new song.</p>
<p>On February 11, they recorded Hey Bulldog at Abbey Road, while I filmed the entire process. We didn't need any promo material for Bulldog, but Paul had also recorded Lady Madonna, the song he had written in memory of his mother, which did need some promotional film. I cut the Bulldog shoot, using the bits of the lads playing and sitting about in the studio, and we used that. Then it vanished, completely disappeared. We thought it had been stolen, as things often were if not nailed down. (Over thirty years later, in August 1999, my original film was rediscovered and used with a reissue of Bulldog to go with the revamped digital version of Yellow Submarine.)</p>
<p>Tony Bramwell<br />Magical Mystery Tours</p>
<p>In fact, three separate clips were edited from the footage, and variously included effects such as filters, double exposures, and extra material filmed at the session for Cilla Black's song Step Inside Love, written by Paul McCartney and recorded in November 1967.</p>
<p>The most common Lady Madonna clip begins with an overhead shot of Ringo Starr on drums, and ends with footage of McCartney from the Step Inside Love session, picking up his coat and guitar and leaving the studio. A lesser-seen variation begins with Starr in a coat and tie and features George Harrison eating a plate of beans.</p>
<p>A third version was created for Anthology in the 1990s, combining elements from both clips plus footage from the 30 July 1968 session for Hey Jude.</p>
<p>Hey Bulldog was recorded in 10 takes, with Lennon on piano, McCartney shaking a tambourine, Harrison on rhythm guitar and Starr on drums. McCartney then overdubbed a bass guitar part onto track two of take 10, accompanied by Harrison playing the main riff on a distorted guitar and additional off-beat snare drum from Starr.</p>
<p>Lennon and McCartney then shared a single microphone to record the vocals, reading from Lennon's handwritten lyrics. This included banter and howling during the song's ending.</p>
<p>I remember Hey Bulldog as being one of John's songs and I helped him finish it off in the studio, but it's mainly his vibe. There's a little rap at the end between John and I, we went into a crazy little thing at the end.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney<br />Many Years From Now, Barry Miles</p>
<p>After Bramwell had finished filming, final overdubs were added. These included the lead guitar solo, performed on George Harrison's Gibson SG Standard, although the identity of the player is uncertain.</p>
<p>Once recording was complete, two mono mixes of Hey Bulldog were made. The second of these was then given to King Features, who made an animated sequence for the Yellow Submarine film to accompany the song.</p>
<p>The mixes were made with the tape machine running slightly faster - 51 cycles per second rather than the usual 50 - which raised the pitch and tempo of the song slightly. Artificial double tracking (ADT) was also used.</p>
<p>That was a really fun song. We were all into sound texture in those days and during the mixing we put ADT on one of the 'What did he say? Woof woof' bits near the end of the song. It came out really well.</p>

<p>Studio Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br />Producer: George Martin<br />Engineers: Geoff Emerick, Ken Scott</p>
<p>There were two scheduled recording sessions on this day. The first took place from 2.30-9pm and saw the completion of The Inner Light and further work on Across The Universe, while the second was a mixing session from 10pm to 12.15am.</p>
<p>The Inner Light was the first to be completed. George Harrison double-tracked his vocals for the final "arrive without traveling" line, and was joined by John Lennon and Paul McCartney on "do all without doing". Three mono mixes, numbered 2-4, were then created and work on the song was complete.</p>
<p>The Beatles then turned their attentions to Lennon's song Across The Universe. A track containing backwards bass and drums was erased and replaced with wordless three-part harmonies from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. An organ part by George Martin and Mellotron by Lennon were also taped and discarded, and the final overdub was electric guitar played through a volume pedal, plus maracas and piano.</p>
<p>Comedian Spike Milligan was present at the session; he and Ringo Starr had appeared in an edition of Cilla Black's television show Cilla two days previously on 6 February 1968. Since Lady Madonna and The Inner Light had both been selected for The Beatles' next single, Milligan asked if it could be used for a charity album to benefit the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p>Two mono mixes created on this night were never issued, but they did include the wildlife effects that can be heard on the Past Masters collection.</p>
<p>The effects were most likely added on this day, and were taken from the Abbey Road library; they included the sounds of children playing and birds twittering and flying. One of this day's mixes was played by The Beatles at the end of the 7 January 1969 Get Back/Let It Be session, to remind themselves of the song's structure.</p>
<p>The World Wildlife Fund album was eventually released on 12 December 1969 as No One's Gonna Change Our World, with Across The Universe as the opening song. The mix which was used was created on 2 October that year.</p>

<p>This was the second edition of Cilla, a variety show with a number of guests each week. Rehearsals took place on this day from 10.30am-1pm, and 2-6.30pm, and the 50-minute show was broadcast live from 8pm. The guests were comedian Spike Milligan and ventriloquist Peter Brough.</p>
<p>Starr appeared during the opening credits and in a number of skits. In the first, he assisted Black in sorting through her fan mail and introduced one of her singing performances, I'm Playing Second Fiddle To A Football Team. A second sketch saw him interact with Peter Brough and performing with his own 'dummy', introduced as Ariadne but actually Black in a school uniform.</p>
<p>Starr and Black duetted unaccompanied on the 1905 song Nellie Dean while he drank from a pint of beer, and finally they sang and danced to a 1917 song entitled Do You Like Me?</p>
<p>The Beatles' two sessions on this day were scheduled to allow an hour's break in between, and it is likely that they watched their bandmate's televised appearance.</p>

<p>John's offering for the new single was the philosophical "Across the Universe", begun this day and completed on the 8th. Six takes were recorded (there was no take three so these were numbered one to seven) with John considering himself best pleased with take seven - the Beatles began an 8:00 pm to 2:00 am session over-dubbing on to this.</p>
<p>But after John had taped his vocal contribution, recorded with the machine running slow to play back fast, he and Paul realized that the song lacked falsetto harmonies. Finding two female singers on a Sunday evening without prior arrangement would usually have been impossible, but for the Beatles all they had to do was step outside the front of EMI Studios and invite inside two of the many fans who congregated there whenever the Beatles were recording. Paul did just this, selecting Lizzie Bravo, a 16 year old from Brazil temporarily living close to Abbey Road, and Gayleen Pease, 17, a Londoner, who were naturally thrilled at being the only fans ever invited to contribute to a Beatles recording.</p>
<p>Once the girl's had taped their "Nothing's gonna change our world" high harmonies they left the studio so that the Beatles could record more overdubs. These included three unusual effects: the first was "Hums Wild"- a 15 second take of humming, recorded and overdubbed three more times to fill the four-track tape, the second was a guitar piece, the third a harp-like sound, the tape box denoting that these latter two were "to be played backwards". At least two of these, "Hums Wild" and the guitar played backwards, were temporarily inserted into "Across the Universe" long enough for John to make a 7 1/2 ips copy for taking home.</p>

<p>The sessions began on 9 January in Bombay (Mumbai), and the soundtrack was mostly complete by 12 January.</p>
<p>On this day Harrison invited camera crews in to film proceedings. Reuters filmed around 45 seconds of colour footage, and BBC News shot slightly less. In the silent footage the musicians are believed to have been working on the track Fantasy Sequins.</p>
<p>The musicians included Ashish Khan (sarod), ahapurush Misra (tabla and pakavaj), Sharad Jadev and Hanuman Jadev (shanhais), Shambu-Das, Indril Bhattacharya and Shankar Ghosh (sitar), Chandra Shakher (sur-bahar), Shiv Kumar Sharmar (santorr), SR Kenkare and Hari Prasad Chaurasia (flute), Vinayak Vohra (taar shehnai) and Rijram Desad (dholak, harmonium and tabla-tarang).</p>
<p>The Bombay sessions took place at EMI Recording Studios, based at the Universal Insurance Building, Sir Pherozeshah Mehta Rd, Fort, Bombay 400001.</p>

<p>Generally perceived to be The Beatles' first artistic failure, the Magical Mystery Tour film was disliked by critics and viewers alike. In an effort to explain the group's creation, Paul McCartney gave an television interview to David Frost.</p>
<p>The interview took place on The Frost Programme, filmed before a studio audience at Associated-Rediffusion's Wembley Studios between 6pm and 7pm, and was broadcast later that evening from 10.30-11.15pm. Frost's conversation with McCartney took up the first half of the show.</p>
<p>David Frost: The Beatles' music brings unanimous enthusiasm and approval pretty well. Last night their television show did not bring unanimous enthusiasm and approval, and everyone seems to be discussing it today. Here is the man most responsible, Mr Paul McCartney.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Good evening, Mr Frost.</p>
<p>David Frost: Good evening, Mr McCartney. Why don't you think that the critics liked this film?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: I don't know, you know. They just didn't seem to like it. I quite liked it myself.</p>
<p>David Frost: Well, I liked it. I didn't see it last night because I was busy, but I saw it today, and I liked it... I mean, with reservations and so on. But why were people so puzzled by it?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: I think they thought it was 'bitty,' which it was a bit. You know, but it was supposed to be like that. I think a lot of people were looking for a plot, and there wasn't one.</p>
<p>David Frost: I saw it in color. That sort of helped, too.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: We thought we could just do a thing... See, we've been waiting for a couple of years now to make another feature film. And we've been asking people to write stories and write plots. But nobody's come up with one, you know. So we thought, 'We'll do something which isn't like that,' which isn't like a real film in as much as it's got a story and a beginning, and we'll just do a selection of, you know... We'd put together a lot of things that we like the look of, and see what happens. I liked it.</p>
<p>David Frost: Did you have a point in mind when you, I mean, some point to get across at all when you did this?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: No. See, that's the trouble, seriously. You gotta do everything with a point or an aim, but we tried this one without anything, with no point and no aim. It's like, you know, we make a record album and all the songs don't necessarily have to fit in with each other, you know. They're just a selection of songs. But when you go to make a film, I don't know, you seem to have to have a thread to pull it all together. We thought that doing a mystery tour, you know - it's all happening on a bus to this group of people - would be enough of a thread. And then, calling it a magical mystery tour, which - like a firm advertises a magical mystery tour, and you go on it, and it really is magic - then anything might happen, and it wouldn't have a thread if it was magic.</p>
<p>David Frost: What's the difference between what you were trying to do here, and say, if you took an EP - which most people have of Magical Mystery Tour - and played that while looking at a kaleidoscope?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yeah.</p>
<p>David Frost: What's the difference between that and what you did? I mean, was that what you were trying to do?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: That's the thing, you know, that there's no real difference between that - except that we had people in the kaleidoscope, and we had things happening. But, I mean, it's not really all that disconnected. The trouble is, that, er, if you watch it a second time it does grow on you. And this is one thing we forgot, because when you make a record, a lot of people listen to our records and say, 'Well, I don't like that one,' you know. But the second time 'round they say, 'Not bad.' And after a few plays they say...</p>
<p>David Frost: Well, now the BBC are going to show it seventeen times. Just sign the thing today.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yeah!</p>
<p>David Frost: Is the fact that it didn't get across to a lot of people, does that fact alter your opinion of it? Do you say, 'Right. It seems to have failed?' Or do you still think it's precisely as good as if people had said it was very good?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yeah. I think it's as good as I always thought it was. But when we were making it, I think all of us thought, 'This has got a very thin plot. We hope this idea of doing a thing without a plot works, because the one thing we're gonna be able to say is, it hasn't got a plot.' But yeah. We thought, 'You don't need a plot. You don't always need one.' Because, like, the things you did today probably didn't have much of a plot.</p>
<p>David Frost: Oh, I was plotting all day. But no, I can see it. Would you call it a success or a failure today?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Er, it's both. You know, it's a success failure. You can't say it was a success, you know, 'cause the papers didn't like it. And that seems to be what people read to find out what's a success. But I think it's alright. I think the next one will be a lot better, and it will have a fat plot, as opposed to a thin plot.</p>
<p>David Frost: But, I mean, what is success then? How would you define that?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: I don't know. I wouldn't try. I suppose, you know, I don't know how many people liked it who saw it.</p>
<p>David Frost: How many people here liked it?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: There's a few, you know. It wasn't much of a success!</p>
<p>David Frost: They like you much more than they liked it, you see. But I mean, [to the audience] you better watch it again and again on BBC.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Seventeen times.</p>
<p>David Frost: Can it be a success when people don't like it?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: It obviously matters. If this morning, we'd awoke to find fantastic reviews then we would have all said, 'It's a success.' And I wouldn't have been on tonight, David. But it doesn't matter all that much, 'cause people said about two of our records, like Strawberry Fields and I Am The Walrus to name but two. They said, 'Those are terrible,' you know, 'You can't talk about let your knickers down on telly. You can't do it.' But you can, you know. I've just done it! And it's alright, you know. Because, in about a year or two, these things that didn't look like successes will look a bit more like successes... you know, as people get into that kind of thing.</p>

But, I mean, it's not really all that disconnected. The trouble is, that, er, if you watch it a second time it does grow on you. And this is one thing we forgot, because when you make a record, a lot of people listen to our records and say, 'Well, I don't like that one,' you know. But the second time 'round they say, 'Not bad.' And after a few plays they say...</p>
<p>David Frost: Well, now the BBC are going to show it seventeen times. Just sign the thing today.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yeah!</p>
<p>David Frost: Is the fact that it didn't get across to a lot of people, does that fact alter your opinion of it? Do you say, 'Right. It seems to have failed?' Or do you still think it's precisely as good as if people had said it was very good?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Yeah. I think it's as good as I always thought it was. But when we were making it, I think all of us thought, 'This has got a very thin plot. We hope this idea of doing a thing without a plot works, because the one thing we're gonna be able to say is, it hasn't got a plot.' But yeah. We thought, 'You don't need a plot. You don't always need one.' Because, like, the things you did today probably didn't have much of a plot.</p>
<p>David Frost: Oh, I was plotting all day. But no, I can see it. Would you call it a success or a failure today?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Er, it's both. You know, it's a success failure. You can't say it was a success, you know, 'cause the papers didn't like it. And that seems to be what people read to find out what's a success. But I think it's alright. I think the next one will be a lot better, and it will have a fat plot, as opposed to a thin plot.</p>
<p>David Frost: But, I mean, what is success then? How would you define that?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: I don't know. I wouldn't try. I suppose, you know, I don't know how many people liked it who saw it.</p>
<p>David Frost: How many people here liked it?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: There's a few, you know. It wasn't much of a success!</p>
<p>David Frost: They like you much more than they liked it, you see. But I mean, [to the audience] you better watch it again and again on BBC.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: Seventeen times.</p>
<p>David Frost: Can it be a success when people don't like it?</p>
<p>Paul McCartney: It obviously matters. If this morning, we'd awoke to find fantastic reviews then we would have all said, 'It's a success.' And I wouldn't have been on tonight, David. But it doesn't matter all that much, 'cause people said about two of our records, like Strawberry Fields and I Am The Walrus to name but two. They said, 'Those are terrible,' you know, 'You can't talk about let your knickers down on telly. You can't do it.' But you can, you know. I've just done it! And it's alright, you know. Because, in about a year or two, these things that didn't look like successes will look a bit more like successes... you know, as people get into that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Having been edited to 55 minutes from nearly 10 hours of footage, The Beatles' television film Magical Mystery Tour had its world premi&egrave;re on BBC 1 at 8.35.</p>
<p><span id="more-3050"></span>It was shown on BBC1 on Boxing Day, which is traditionally music hall and Bruce Forsyth and Jimmy Tarbuck time. Now we had this very stoned show on, just when everyone's getting over Christmas. I think a few people were surprised. The critics certainly had a field day and said, 'Oh, disaster, disaster!'</p>
<p>Although filmed in colour, Magical Mystery Tour was shown in black and white. Viewers were left baffled by many of the sequences, and television critics savaged the production.</p>
<p>Being British, we thought we'd give it to the BBC, which in those days was the biggest channel, who showed it in black and white. We were stupid and they were stupid. It was hated. They all had their chance to say, 'They've gone too far. Who do they think they are? What does it mean?' It was like the rock-opera situation: 'They're not Beethoven.' They were still looking for things that made sense, and this was pretty abstract.</p>
<div>
<p>It was a crowd of people having a lot of fun with whatever came into mind. It was really slated but, of course, when people started seeing it in colour they realised that it was a lot of fun. In a weird way, I certainly feel it stood the test of time, but I can see that somebody watching it in black and white would lose so much of it &ndash; it would make no sense (especially the aerial ballet shot). We sent a guy out filming all over Iceland, and then it was shown in black and white &ndash; I mean, what is this? Painted silly clowns and magicians. What does it mean?</p>
<p>The press coverage the following day was almost wholly hostile.</p>

<p>More than two weeks before its accompanying film received its premiere on BBC television, The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour EP was released.</p>
<p>As The Beatles had six songs for release, it was decided that they would release a double-EP set. The package came with a gatefold sleeve and a 28-page book, including lyrics. This retailed at twice the normal price of a single.</p>
<p>The EP had the catalogue number Parlophone MMT 1 (mono) and SMMT 1 (stereo). It was the first Beatles EP to be issued in both mono and stereo.</p>
<p>Magical Mystery Tour entered the charts on 13 December, and spent 12 weeks in the top 40. Its highest chart position was number two on the singles chart, the dedicated EP chart having been abandoned at the start of December 1967. It was held off the top spot by The Beatles' own Hello, Goodbye.</p>
<p>The EP retailed at 19 shillings and sixpence. It had advance orders in the UK of 400,000, and by mid January 1968 had sold 600,000.</p>
<p>The two-disc EP was reissued in 2012 as part of the deluxe Blu-ray edition of Magical Mystery Tour.</p>

And we were all muttering about, 'Well, if we're going to have to open a shop, let's open something we're interested in.' We went through all these different ideas about this, that and the other. Paul had a nice idea about opening up white houses where it would sell white china and things like that, everything white because you can never get anything white, which is pretty groovy. It didn't end up with that, it ended up with Apple, with all this junk and The Fool and all the stupid clothes and all that. (John Lennon, 1970)</p>

<p>The Beatles' fifth fan club Christmas record was recorded and mixed on this day, between 6pm and 2.45am. This was the group's final recording session in 1967.<br />[amazon template=iframe image2&amp;asin=B000034CGB]</p>
<p>The song, credited to Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey, was titled Christmas Time (Is Here Again). It featured all four Beatles on vocals, as well as producer George Martin and actor Victor Spinetti.</p>
<p>The original recording lasted 6'37". The theme song was taped in a single take, with Paul McCartney on piano, George Harrison playing an acoustic guitar, Ringo Starr on drums and John Lennon joining in on a bass drum. The Beatles then added two sets of lead vocals, singing the title phrase repeatedly, and Starr singing "O-U-T spells 'out'". The song had 10 verses, the last of which was instrumental.</p>
<p>The group then recorded 10 takes of speech and sketches, overlaid with sound effects. These included parodies of radio and television broadcasts, a tap dancing duet by Starr and Spinetti, a brief rendition of Plenty Of Jam Jars by "The Ravellers", and a spoof advert for the miraculous product Wonderlust. It ended with a nonsense poem by John Lennon, narrated on top of an organ version of Auld Lang Syne.</p>
<p>The Beatles' Christmas Fan Club single, 1967Once recording was complete, the song was mixed in mono. Four mixes were made, of take 1 (music), and takes 2, 6 and 10 (speech). The parts were edited together on the following day, and the completed version was then sent to Lyntone Records, who pressed the fan club flexi-disc.</p>
<p>The 1995 single Free As A Bird single contained a 3'03" mix of the Christmas Time (Is Here Again) song. Towards the end of this version, somewhat incongruously, some Christmas Beatle greetings from 1966 were included.</p>
<p>Christmas Time (Is Here Again) was the group's last Christmas disc to be recorded together at Abbey Road. In 1968 and 1969 their contributions were recorded separately, and edited together to give a sense of unity.</p>
<p>The Beatles' recording session for this day ended at 2.45am, but John Lennon stayed behind to compile tapes for the National Theatre production of a play he had written, Scene Three, Act One, based on a piece from his 1964 book In His Own Write.</p>

<p>In mid-November 1967, NME's Norrie Drummond had a lunchtime chat with John, Paul and Ringo during a quick break from their work at a small film studio in Soho. At the time of this interview, the Beatles were in the editing stage of their upcoming made-for-TV film 'Magical Mystery Tour.'</p>
<p>Magical Mystery Tour, a psychedelic film, unfortunately would be aired in black-and-white by the BBC. It received mixed reviews from the public, while being slammed by the professional critics. It became famous at that time as the Beatles' first critical failure, yet historically it is also regarded as an early advance into the music video age -- featuring some of the earliest examples of surreal rock videos, including 'I Am The Walrus.' The videos that appear in the 'Magical Mystery Tour' film seemed to further explore the direction that had begun with their earlier promotional video for 'Strawberry Fields Forever.'</p>
<p>The following interview, entitled 'Norrie Drummond Lunches With John, Paul And Ringo,' appeared in the November 25th 1967 issue of the New Musical Express. Topics of discussion include the process of directing and editing their own movie, and Ringo talks about his upcoming film with Richard Burton and Marlon Brando, entitled 'Candy.' Also discussed is the newly-released Beatles song 'I Am The Walrus' and its lyrics 'You let your knickers down' being criticized as too obscene for radio.</p>
<p>Albeit much too brief, an additional tidbit of interest is Drummond's first-hand account of the process as the three Beatles work on the film in the editing studio just before breaking for lunch.</p>
<p>The crudely written sign on the door read 'Magical Mystery Tour' and from within came the strains of 'She Loves You' being played on a barrel-organ. A handful of young girls waiting patiently outside eyed me up and down as I pushed open the door and entered.</p>
<p>The small room was hot and smokey. Long strips of film hung from steel coat racks and dozens of LPs lay scattered around the floor. Empty coffee cups were dotted everywhere with ashtrays spilled over with cigarette butts.</p>
<p>That was the scene last weekend in a small studio in the heart of Soho where the Beatles are at work editing their TV film.</p>
<p>John and Ringo were sitting at a table watching the film through a viewfinder, while Paul was synchronizing the sound of the barrel-organ. George was having a day off work.</p>
<p>"Ah, Drummond's here. Must be time for lunch," said Paul, switching off the music.</p>
<p>The three Beatles pulled on their jackets, and with road manager bodyguard-friend Mal Evans and Peter Brown (the late Brian Epstein's personal assistant), we left for a small restaurant about two blocks away.</p>
<p>Anyone walking through Soho following us with a film camera could have made a wonderful short just by filming the expressions of passers-by. Some looked and recognized. Others looked and puzzled. But most just stared. And as we entered the restaurant one middle-aged lady almost choked over her spaghetti.</p>
<p>"You know, it's just great to be back at work again," declared Paul as we settled down at our table. "For the past eight weeks we've been working regularly -- just like people! We start at about eleven every morning. Have an hour for lunch, and finish about seven in the evening. What's more, we work seven days a week."</p>
<p>Just last week Peter Brown called George at home and his wife Patti declared quite proudly, "Oh no, George isn't here. He's out at work."</p>
<p>Magical Mystery Tour was the Beatles first attempt at editing and directing their own film. Had it been as successful as they hoped?</p>
<p>"Well, we probably won't be finished for another couple of weeks," John replied, "but we're happy with what we've done so far."</p>
<p>"Film-making isn't as difficult as many people imagine," added Paul. "It's a matter of common sense more than anything. We'd never directed anything before and we didn't know about editing, but we're learning. Magical Mystery Tour was an experiment and so far it's been successful."</p>
<p>Did this mean that in future the Beatles would write, produce and direct their own full-length films?</p>
<p>"Mystery Tour is almost a full-length movie," said Ringo, looking up from his plate. "I imagine that we could make a film for cinema showing sometime. We'd like to make our next film that way."</p>
<p>"We learned so much from working on our own," continued Paul. "When we were making 'Help!' with director Dick Lester, he used to ask us to do the same scene over and over again, and at that time we thought it was just because our acting wasn't up to much. But now we realize that it wasn't necessarily so. When a film is being made you generally shoot about ten times as much film as is used in the finished product. Then of course it has to be edited down."</p>
<p>As the main course arrived, conversation changed to Ringo's forthcoming film role in 'Candy' in which he plays the part of a Mexican gardener.</p>
<p>"Yes that's me alright,' he declared in a mock-American accent. "I'll be starring with Burton and Brando. Ringo Starr they call me with the emphasis on Starr." And then more seriously, "Candy is a young girl who goes around making love to lots of men, and I'm the first. We'll be filming in Italy for about two weeks from the beginning of next month. I'm looking forward to it. Although it's only a small part, I'm pleased. It's what they call a cameo role and of course the other names in the film should help it a lot."</p>
<p>This led to the subject of John's appearance in 'How I Won The War.' Was he happy with the rather mixed reception the film had received? "I think the reviews were fair. I was happy with my part. It was an experience."</p>
<p>All three of them were completely knocked out by 'Bonnie And Clyde' when they went to see it. "One of the best films I've ever seen," declared John.</p>
<p>They also went to see 'The Oldest Profession' recently. That's the film which was billed as a 'lusty lustful luscious eyeful,' the star of which is Racquel Welch. "We sneaked in there the other week," said Ringo, "thinking that no one would see us. But when the lights went up we found we were sitting next to a bloke who used to work on Radio Caroline!"</p>
<p>What about the criticism that the group had received regarding the lyrics of 'I Am The Walrus,' the b-side of their new single. "It always seems to happen now, that people misinterpret what we write or say. We're happy with the words and I don't see how they can offend anyone. Do you think they're obscene?" Also to be released shortly is a special presentations pack containing the six recordings from 'Magical Mystery Tour,' along with a 32-page color booklet. Paul stated, "We wanted to do this because when we were young we couldn't think of anything to buy people for presents at that price. The only things you could get were either ties or soap and talcum powder. But we think that the pack is a good present."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a lovely gift for someone," added Ringo.</p>
<p>"And that's what you're getting," replied John.</p>
<p>"Well, it's about time we got back to work, men," declared Paul, draining his coffee cup. "Lunch break's over."</p>
<p>As we walked back through Soho, Paul suddenly spotted Billy, an old friend of the boys. Billy is about sixty and wanders around Soho with a bottle on his head and a carnation behind each ear. "We'd have loved him for the film," whispered Paul as he, John, Ringo and Billy broke into a chorus of 'Singing The Blues.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"summary";s:7848:"<p><span style="color: #000000;">Beatles Interview: In Soho 11/25/1967</span></p>
<p>In mid-November 1967, NME's Norrie Drummond had a lunchtime chat with John, Paul and Ringo during a quick break from their work at a small film studio in Soho. At the time of this interview, the Beatles were in the editing stage of their upcoming made-for-TV film 'Magical Mystery Tour.'</p>
<p>Magical Mystery Tour, a psychedelic film, unfortunately would be aired in black-and-white by the BBC. It received mixed reviews from the public, while being slammed by the professional critics. It became famous at that time as the Beatles' first critical failure, yet historically it is also regarded as an early advance into the music video age -- featuring some of the earliest examples of surreal rock videos, including 'I Am The Walrus.' The videos that appear in the 'Magical Mystery Tour' film seemed to further explore the direction that had begun with their earlier promotional video for 'Strawberry Fields Forever.'</p>
<p>The following interview, entitled 'Norrie Drummond Lunches With John, Paul And Ringo,' appeared in the November 25th 1967 issue of the New Musical Express. Topics of discussion include the process of directing and editing their own movie, and Ringo talks about his upcoming film with Richard Burton and Marlon Brando, entitled 'Candy.' Also discussed is the newly-released Beatles song 'I Am The Walrus' and its lyrics 'You let your knickers down' being criticized as too obscene for radio.</p>
<p>Albeit much too brief, an additional tidbit of interest is Drummond's first-hand account of the process as the three Beatles work on the film in the editing studio just before breaking for lunch.</p>
<p>The crudely written sign on the door read 'Magical Mystery Tour' and from within came the strains of 'She Loves You' being played on a barrel-organ. A handful of young girls waiting patiently outside eyed me up and down as I pushed open the door and entered.</p>

<p>On 10 November 1967, The Beatles had made a promotional film for the single Hello, Goodbye. Since no viola players featured in the clip, they risked contravening a Musicians' Union ban on miming, since it would make it obvious that the music was not all live.</p>
<p>In order to escape censure, a new mono mix was made on this day. It omitted the viola parts, and was subsequently dubbed onto the BBC's copy of the film. However, it was a wasted effort as The Beatles' own performance made it clear that they were miming, and the film was not shown in the UK.</p>
<p>The BBC had planned to show the promo on Top Of The Pops on 23 November 1967, but this was cancelled on the 20th. The official reason was that "a minor portion of the film contravened the Musicians' Union regulations concerning miming on television".</p>
<p>On 21 November, BBC cameramen attended an edition session for the Magical Mystery Tour film, to gather replacement footage, but the 23 November edition of Top Of The Pops instead ran footage from the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night. A combination of footage from the edit suite and still photographs was eventually shown on the 7 December 1967 edition of the show.</p>
<p>Also during this brief session, which ran from 10.30-11am, copies were made of the final mono mixes of It's All Too Much, All Together Now and Only A Northern Song, for the producers of the Yellow Submarine animated film.</p>

<p>Studios One and Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br />Producer: George Martin<br />Engineers: Ken Scott, Geoff Emerick</p>
<p>This busy day saw two separate sessions booked at different studios at Abbey Road, mainly for mixing of songs from the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack.</p>
<p>The first session took place in the control room of Studio Two, between 2.30pm and 5.45pm. Blue Jay Way was the first song to be tackled, and was mixed in stereo in two atttempts. These were known as remix mono 1 and 2.</p>
<p>This was followed by a single stereo mix of Flying, and edits of both songs. The balance engineer for this first session was Ken Scott.</p>
<p>Scott was not involved in the second session, which was held in Studio One from 9pm to 4.30am; the engineer was Geoff Emerick. It began with nine mono mixes of Blue Jay Way, numbered 20-28, followed by three more stereo mixes, numbered 10-12. The best of these - mono mix 27 and stereo mix 12 - were then edited, and became the master versions.</p>
<p>The third song to be mixed was <em><strong>Magical Mystery Tour</strong></em>. Two stereo mixes were made, and two overdubs were simultaneously added. During the editing of the film, John Lennon had added a spoken introduction: "Roll up, roll up for the <em><strong>Magical Mystery Tour</strong></em>! Step right this way! Hurry, hurry, hurry!" It was decided that this should be added to the record release too.</p>
<p>The fourth stereo mix made during the November 6, 1967 session was copied onto a new take, and Paul McCartney simultaneously recreated Lennon's spiel, although he left out the "Hurry, hurry, hurry!" section.</p>
<p>A tape loop of traffic noise, assembled back on April 25th, was also added. Two stereo mixes, numbered 5 and 6, were then made of Magical Mystery Tour, followed by three, numbered 8-10, in mono.</p>
<p>The session ended with copies of I Am The Walrus, Your Mother Should Know, Flying, Magical Mystery Tour, Blue Jay Way, The Fool On The Hill and Strawberry Fields Forever being made for Capitol Records' representative Voyle Gilmore, who took them back to the United States for release.</p>

<p>Studio Three (control room), EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br />Producer: George Martin<br />Engineer: Geoff Emerick</p>
<p>Stereo mixes of four Magical Mystery Tour songs were made in customarily swift fashion during this session, which lasted from 2.30-6pm.</p>
<p>The first task was the creation of two mixes of <em><strong>Hello, Goodbye,</strong></em> the second of which was used as the master version.</p>
<p>The song's b-side, <em><strong>I Am The Walrus</strong></em>, was the next to be tackled, and was mixed in seven attempts. As the King Lear radio feed had been incorporated directly into the mono mix rather than the multitrack tape, this necessitated some studio trickery. The first half of the stereo master was made of stereo mix six, and from the 2'03" onwards it switched to a fake stereo version of mono mix 22, made on 29 September 1967.</p>
<p>Fake stereo involved slashing the treble from one channel and the bass from another, and was the best that could be achieved in the circumstances. The edit was made towards the end of the session.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your Mother Should Know</strong></em> was the third song to be mixed, and took two attempts. It was followed by four of the <em><strong>Magical Mystery Tour</strong></em> title track. These were judged to be unsatisfactory, however, and further recording took place on November 7th.</p>

<p>The filming of <em><strong>Magical Mystery Tour</strong></em> was completed this day with inserts for George's <strong><em>"Blue Jay Way"</em> </strong>sequence (otherwise shot at West Malling) done at Ringo's country house in Weybridge, 19 miles south-west of London.</p>
<p>Principally, the Beatles filmed in Ringo's spacious back garden, each of them pretending to play a lovely white cello.

<p>When it was John's turn, the others rushed into the picture fooling around with a football. George was also filmed running down some garden steps, and the cello - without a player - was filmed in front of plopping and fizzing fireworks (easily obtained this time of year with Guy Fawkes night only 48 hours away). A number of children were also filmed playing around in the garden. Moving inside the house, a topless Mal Evans was filmed with George's West Malling "<strong><em>Blue Jay Way</em></strong>" sequence projected onto his chest, and then various Beatles were filmed watching "<strong><em>Blue Jay Way</em></strong>" on a screen. John doing so while bobbing to and fro on a rockinghorse (the possession of Ringo's two year old son Zak).</p>

<p>Paul McCartney, Mal Evans and cameraman Aubrey Dewar were woken at 3.30am by a taxi driver, who had been hired to take them to locations in Nice where they could film a sequence for The Fool On The Hill for Magical Mystery Tour.<br />We just asked the local taxi driver, 'Where is a good place to see the sunrise from?' Nice was fairly easily accessible. It had good mountain scenery and I figured we might get a good clear sunrise down there. It was the right time of the year. We all piled in the taxi and drove up into the mountains behind Nice. It took us about an hour and sunrise was in about half an hour. We unpacked the stuff from the boot, loaded up his camera, set up the tripod where we knew the sun would rise, and waited in the freezing cold. I had a big long black coat on and we just waited until the the sun arose. And I just danced around and he filmed it.</p>
<p>I just ad-libbed the whole thing. I went, 'Right, get over there: Let me dance. Let me jump from this rock to this rock. Get a lot of the sun rising. Get a perfect shot and let me stand in front of it.' I just had a little Philips cassette to mime to and roughly get the feeling of the song. There was no clapper because there was no sound. Just my cassette. I said, 'We'll lay in the sound of "Fool on the Hill" afterwards.' I'm miming sometimes, but of course it should be in synch, that's what clappers are for. I didn't know these small technicalities, and also I wasn't that interested in being that precise.</p>
<p>We stayed until the sun went down. As the day went on, the light got worse. It got to be harsh daylight, so we got less material in the daytime. We basically used all the dawn stuff. And that was it. It was very spontaneous, as was the whole of Magical Mystery Tour. Later, when we came to try to edit it all, it was very difficult because I hadn't sung it to synch.</p>
<p>We shouldn't have really had just one cameraman, it was anti-union. That was another reason to go to France. The unions wouldn't have allowed it in Britain, nor probably in France, but they didn't know we were doing it. It was just the four of us; there was none of this grips, best boy, gaffer, none of that. In fact, our biggest danger was that the film didn't conform with one union rule.</p>

<p>The flute parts were recorded on a separate tape as take seven, as all tracks on the main tape were full. On October 25, 1967 takes six and seven were mixed in sync to create a final mono master.</p>
<p>Hello, Goodbye still had its working title Hello Hello at this stage. Viola players Ken Essex and Birnbaum had been booked to play between 8pm and 11pm, but the session overran and they were paid a double fee.</p>

<p>This was the first recording session for which John Lennon was officially listed as a producer. It saw work on two songs, George Harrison's <em><strong>Blue Jay Way</strong></em>, and some incidental music for the Magical Mystery Tour film known as Shirley's Wild Accordion.</p>
<p>The first task was the creation of mono mixes of <em><strong>Blue Jay Way</strong></em>. Eight mixes were created, numbered 2-9, following which an edit of the sixth and ninth attempts was made.</p>
<p>Shirley's Wild Accordion was a Lennon-McCartney composition, although it wasn't officially a Beatles recording. It featured Shirley Evans on accordion, accompanied by her musical partner and then husband Reg Wale on percussion. Paul McCartney also played maracas and yelled "Go on, Shirl!", while Ringo Starr played drums.</p>
<p>The track was recorded under the working title of Accordion (Wild), and was cut from the final edit of the film. It was recorded in eight basic takes, with Evans playing from a score written by Mike Leander from ideas by Lennon and McCartney.</p>
<p>Two reduction mixes were then made, numbered nine and 10, followed by overdubs. The recording was completed with five additional takes, numbered takes 11-15.</p>
<p>Three mono mixes Shirley's Wild Accordion were then made, numbered 1-3, from takes 10, 7 and 14 respectively. The second was subtitled Waltz, and the third was known as Freaky Rock. The session ended at 2am on the morning of October 13, 1967.</p>
<p>A mix of Shirley's Wild Accordion was included in the bonus material of the 2012 reissue of the <strong>Magical Mystery Tour</strong> film. It omitted the drums and maracas, but kept various other percussive sounds.</p>

<p>Studio Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br /> Producer: George Martin<br /> Engineer: Ken Scott</p>
<p>Two songs for the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack were worked on during this session: I Am The Walrus and Flying. <span id="more-6424"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">Before The Beatles arrived, however, copies were made of the songs Magical Mystery Tour and Flying for the film's producer Denis O'Dell. This took place from 4-5.30pm in the control room of Studio Two.</div>
<p>George Martin then turned his attention to I Am The Walrus. All four tracks on the tape were full after the backing vocals were recorded during the previous day's session. Furthermore, the rhythm guitar, bass and lead vocals were all on the same track due to reduction mixes made on that day, the last being labelled take 25.</p>
<p>To allow greater flexibility, George Martin went back to the earlier take 17, which had a spare track, and dubbed the orchestral and choral overdubs onto it. All subsequent mixing was done from this take.</p>
<p>The Beatles were present for the evening session, which began at 7pm and ended at 3am. It began with four mono mixes, numbered 2-5, of I Am The Walrus. The second was considered best for the time being, although it was replaced the following evening.</p>
<p>Flying, which at this stage still had the working title Aerial Tour Instrumental, was then given more overdubs. Ringo Starr played maracas, George Harrison added an acoustic guitar part, and John Lennon played the Mellotron on the flute setting.</p>
<p>Lennon and Starr also prepared some tape loops containing Mellotron, organ and chimes, to replace the previous Dixieland ending. These were added in five separate overdubs: the first lasted from 1'24" until 2'48", and was played backwards; the second ran from 2'51" to 5'14"; the third appeared from 5'25" to 6'09"; tape four was played backwards from 6'16" to 7'01"; and the final one, also played backwards, lasted from 7'06 to 9'35".</p>
<p>These were likely assembled as incidental music to be used throughout the film, rather than as a part of Flying; the final mix fades before the first tape had ended. At the end of the session two mono mixes were made of Flying, numbered five and six, the latter of which was selected for the soundtrack release.</p>

<p>Two separate sessions took place on this day, involving overdubs for the Magical Mystery Tour song <em><strong>I Am The Walrus.</strong></em> <span id="more-6421"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">The Beatles had recorded the backing track for I Am The Walrus on September 5th and 6th 1967. On this day, in a three-hour session beginning at 2.30pm, George Martin's orchestral score was recorded.</div>
<p>The session musicians were recorded simultaneously with a reduction mix, in Abbey Road's Studio Two. It took seven attempts - numbered 18-24 - to complete, with take 20 being the best. The final four takes, however, were edit pieces not lasting the length of the song.</p>
<p>The musicians were: violinists Sidney Sax, Jack Rothstein, Ralph Elman, Andrew McGee, Jack Greene, Louis Stevens, John Jezzard and Jack Richards; cellists Lionel Ross, Eldon Fox, Bram Martin and Terry Weil; clarinetist Gordon Lewin; and horn players Neil Sanders, Tony Tunstall and Morris Miller.</p>
<p>The day's second session took place in Studio One from 7pm to 3.30am. This was for the choral overdubs, and began with a reduction mix of take 20, which became take 25.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I had this whole choir saying 'Everybody's got one, everybody's got one.' But when you get thirty people, male and female, on top of thirty cellos and on top of the Beatles' rock 'n' roll rhythm section, you can't hear what they're saying.</div>
</blockquote>

<div>John worked with George Martin on the orchestration and did some very exciting things with the Mike Sammes Singers...

<p>Studios One and Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br /> Producer: George Martin<br /> Engineer: Ken Scott</p>
<p>Two separate sessions took place on this day, involving overdubs for the Magical Mystery Tour song <em><strong>I Am The Walrus.</strong></em> <span id="more-6421"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">The Beatles had recorded the backing track for I Am The Walrus on September 5th and 6th 1967. On this day, in a three-hour session beginning at 2.30pm, George Martin's orchestral score was recorded.</div>
<p>The session musicians were recorded simultaneously with a reduction mix, in Abbey Road's Studio Two. It took seven attempts - numbered 18-24 - to complete, with take 20 being the best. The final four takes, however, were edit pieces not lasting the length of the song.</p>
<p>The musicians were: violinists Sidney Sax, Jack Rothstein, Ralph Elman, Andrew McGee, Jack Greene, Louis Stevens, John Jezzard and Jack Richards; cellists Lionel Ross, Eldon Fox, Bram Martin and Terry Weil; clarinetist Gordon Lewin; and horn players Neil Sanders, Tony Tunstall and Morris Miller.</p>
<p>The day's second session took place in Studio One from 7pm to 3.30am. This was for the choral overdubs, and began with a reduction mix of take 20, which became take 25.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I had this whole choir saying 'Everybody's got one, everybody's got one.' But when you get thirty people, male and female, on top of thirty cellos and on top of the Beatles' rock 'n' roll rhythm section, you can't hear what they're saying.</div>

<p>The fourth day of filming for Magical Mystery Tour began with a scene in a field near Newquay in the south west of England.</p>
<p>In the morning the coach party set off to look for a secluded field. Upon setting up the camera and lighting equipment, however, crowds of onlookers meant police had to deal with a traffic jam. Two scenes were filmed in the field, only one of which - the passengers crowding into a small tent - was used. The other was of George Harrison meditating in the field while wearing am oversized blue jacket.</p>
<p>The coach returned to the Atlantic Hotel in Newquay for a late lunch at 4pm, with music in the dining room provided by a resident band. Although the lunch was filmed, it was left out of the final cut.</p>
<p>In the evening, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Neil Aspinall and others, including BBC radio reporter Miranda Ward, visited a pub in Perranporth where they were joined by musician Spencer Davis, who was holidaying in the area with his family.</p>
<p>The evening ended with a lock-in until after 2am, during which McCartney led a singalong around the pub piano. According to Miranda Ward, he sang "every pub standard bar Yellow Submarine, which he refused to play".</p>

<p>ilming: Magical Mystery Tour<br />Wednesday 13 September 1967 Film and video</p>
<p>The third day of filming for Magical Mystery Tour began in Watergate Bay in Newquay in the south west of England.</p>
<p>In the late morning The Beatles and some of the hired actors were taken to the bay. There, the group were filmed looking through a telescope, although the scene failed to make the final cut. Aunt Jessie was also filmed with Buster Bloodvessel (Ivor Cutler) on Tregurrian Beach, although the BBC cut it too, having decided it was unsuitable for viewers.</p>
<p>Following lunch at Newquay's Atlantic Hotel, afternoon filming took place in two separate groups. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr took the coach and most of the passengers to Porth near Watergate Bay.</p>
<p>During the journey Starr and Aunt Jessie ad libbed an argument for the cameras. In the late afternoon, on the beach at Porth, McCartney was filmed walking and cycling on a tandem with Little George the Photographer, played by George Claydon.</p>
<p>Back in the Newquay hotel, John Lennon directed a sequence in which Happy Nat the Rubber Man, played by Nat Jackley, chased bikini-clad women around the swimming pool. The shoot continued on the cliffs at nearby Holywell, although it was left out of the final edit.</p>
<p>George Harrison was the only Beatle not to take part in afternoon filming. Instead, he gave a lengthy radio interview to the BBC's Miranda Ward, half of which was broadcast on the first edition of Radio 1's Scene And Heard on 30 September 1967 from 6.30pm. The second part was broadcast on the following week's show.</p>
<p>Ward stayed in Newquay until Friday 15 September, and on the Thursday interviewed Ringo Starr for Scene And Heard. This was broadcast in the 14 October edition.</p>

<p>The first full day of filming for The Beatles' television film Magical Mystery Tour took place in the south west of England.</p>
<p>The coach had arrived in Teignmouth in Devon on the previous night, and the party stayed at the Royal Hotel. Following breakfast on this day, the coach set off once again and headed for the Dartmoor village of Widecombe.</p>
<p>The annual village fair was being held in Widecombe, and it was decided that filming should take place there. However, the driver Alf Manders took a shortcut in order to beat traffic queues, and the coach became stuck on a narrow bridge.</p>
<p>The coach had to be reversed for half a mile, and tempers frayed on board. Footage was made of on-board arguments, though none was used. In the end The Beatles decided to abandon the trip to the fair, disappointing some local fans who had heard about their impending arrival.</p>
<p>The mystery trip continued instead to Plymouth on the A38. The party had lunch in the Grand Hotel, situated on the famous Plymouth Hoe, where The Beatles posed for photographers from national newspapers.</p>
<p>John Lennon and Paul McCartney were also interviewed by BBC TV reporter Hugh Scully. The interview was shown as the lead item on the local news programme Spotlight South West on the following day from 5.55pm.</p>
<p>The party then boarded the coach once more, and continued along the A38. Stops were made at Liskeard and Bodmin - where filming took place outside West End Dairy in Higher Bore Street and no Paull Road. For the latter scene, the courier Jolly Jimmy Johnson, played by Derek Royle, boarded the coach and welcomed everybody. The sequence was used at the beginning of the film.</p>
<p>The final destination for the day was the Atlantic Hotel on Dane Road, Newquay. The Beatles had intended to stay for just one night, but eventually decided to use it as a base for three nights. They slept in four holiday flats.</p>

<p>The filming of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour was mostly done in two week-long periods. The first began on this day. <span id="more-6417"></span></p>
<p>It was traditional for pop package tours, involving several bands, to begin at London's Allsop Place, near to Baker Street underground station. Paul McCartney decided that the mystery trip should start at the same location at 10.45am.</p>
<p>The coach, however, was still being decorated with the Magical Mystery Tour lettering and colours. The passengers - included family, friends, fan club staff, actors and other selected travellers - were made to wait two hours for its arrival.</p>
<p>While waiting, McCartney went to the London Transport caf&eacute; above Baker Street station, where he bought a cup of tea and signed autographs. He then went to Soho with Mal Evans to purchase appropriate uniforms for the driver and courier.</p>
<p>As the coach left London on the A30, Neil Aspinall gave each person a &pound;5 note to cover their meals for the week. There were 43 people on the coach, including the group and the film technicians. John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were picked up in Virginia Water, Surrey, close to their homes.</p>
<p>Filming began soon after, with scenes improvised on the coach and during a lunch break at the Pied Piper restaurant in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Late in the evening the coach arrived at its first destination, the Royal Hotel at The Den, Teignmouth, Devon, where the entire party spent the night.</p>
<p>The Beatles arrived at the hotel in a car, having swapped vehicles just outside the town in a bid to remain incognito. Nevertheless, they were greeted by 400 local teenagers, who had discovered their supposedly secret plans and waited in the rain to catch a glimpse of the stars.</p>
<p>At the hotel McCartney gave an impromptu press conference, where he gave an outline of The Beatles' plans for the film. He and Neil Aspinall then sorted out room arrangements for the coach party, before discussing the next day's shooting with Lennon and technical director Peter Theobalds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><strong>ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW:</strong></center>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the early part of September 1967, Paul McCartney invited Norrie Drummond to his Cavendish Avenue home for an exclusive interview. The conversation would be published in the September 9th issue of the New Musical Express, and later reprinted for the United States in the January 1968 issue of Hit Parader magazine.</span></p>
<p>The article as it orignally appeared was entitled 'Paul Is Still Seeking, But George Has Found Great Faith' with a teaser on the NME cover that read, 'Beatle Paul's New Life.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chat between Drummond and McCartney touches on spiritual matters, and the Beatles' new creative vantage point. At the time of this interview the Beatles are making last minute arrangements to begin filming their made-for-TV movie 'Magical Mystery Tour.' Meanwhile, the 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' LP is still at the number one spot on the US and British album charts, three solid months following its June release. <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jay Spangler, www.beatlesinterviews.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /> As most people must have noticed, the Beatles have undergone a major change in the past year. The moptops have gone and been replaced by four highly individual, creative personalities. The 'yeah-yeahs' and the 'ooohs' have given way to sitars and melotrons. The Beatle boots and round-collared jackets have been discarded and been replaced by kaftans and beads. No longer is it news when they are seen at clubs or theatres. At last the screams are fading away. To find out more about the great Beatles' transformation I visited Paul McCartney at his St. John's Wood home recently.</span></p>
<p>I told my taxi-driver the address. "Oh, you mean where that Beatle lives," he said. No more than half a dozen fans were waiting patiently at the massive iron gates of his house. The gates were opened by his housekeeper, Mrs. Mills ("She still hasn't given me a tune yet," says Paul), who led me into the lounge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul's huge Old English Sheepdog, Martha, bounded forward, leaped up, put both front paws on my shoulders and started chewing my tie. His three cats -- Jesus, Joseph and Mary -- were crawling over each other underneath the television set. Paul, dressed in a green, floral-patterned shirt and green slacks, sat cross-legged in a large green velvet armchair. Mike McGear, Paul's brother, was just leaving with several kaftans over his arm. A large 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' poster is pinned to one wall. His book collection includes many works on yoga and meditation. At the moment all four Beatles are on holiday, although they have been recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I used to tell you we didn't know what our plans were, it was simply that we hadn't been told what we were going to be doing. Now we simply just don't know."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills reappeared bearing cups of tea and a large cream sponge. "The only thing lined up for us is the TV show," said Paul, stirring his tea. "But we're still trying to work out the format. We've also been recording the past few nights, and our next album will probably come from the TV show."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything that the Beatles now indulge in they obviously do for love, not for money. "We can now sit back and pick and choose what we want to do. We're not going to turn out records or films just for the sake of it. We don't want to talk unless we've got something to say."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When you don't have to make a living, a job has a different meaning. Most people have to earn a wage to live. If you don't, you take a job to relieve the boredom, but you do something which gives you pleasure."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We enjoy recording, but we want to go even further. I would like to come up with a completely new form of music, invent new sounds. I want to do something, but I don't really know what."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At the moment I'm thinking things out. There seems to be a pause in my life right now... a time for reassessment." I asked Paul if he ever regarded himself as being rather like a retired man of sixty-five, who was now only pottering around, dabbling in his favorite hobby. To a certain extent he was inclined to agree. "I don't regard myself as having retired, but what do most people do when they retire? As you say, they become wrapped up in a hobby. Either that or they find another job."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I would like to do something else, but what that will be, I don't know." Despite the fact that three of the Beatles are married and they are, all four of them, very different individuals, they still have that same bond of loyalty to each other that they have always had. They are still each others' best friends. If they are asked to do something as a group and any one of them doesn't want to take part, then the scheme is dropped. "If three of us wanted to make a film, for instance, and the fourth didn't think it was a good idea, we'd forget about it, because the fourth person would have a very good reason for not wanting to do it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past year Paul has become a much more introspective person. He is constantly striving to discover more about other people. What is depression? Why do people become bored? What is his ultimate goal? These are the questions to which Paul has tried to find the answers in books on meditation and in lectures by men who know more about it than he does. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is playing a big part in developing the Beatle minds. He is the man who gave them strength when they heard of Brian Epstein's tragic death. "I'm more tolerant now than I was, and I feel more at ease myself, but I'm not less certain about many things," said Paul. "In some ways I envy George, because he now has a great faith. He seems to have found what he's been searching for."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When we went to India we were amazed. So many people, living in terrible poverty... but everyone was so happy. They were always laughing and smiling, even though most of them were starving. For people in the Western world to understand why these people can be so happy is a very difficult thing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With John, George, and Ringo, Paul will be flying to India again shortly to study transcendental meditation with Maharishi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To a certain extent, Paul's music is his greatest emotional outlet. "Ravi Shankar discovered himself through his music, and I suppose in many ways we are, too." This is apparent in their latest albums, which feature many tracks based on personal experiences. But how far can one go with any new art form, be it music, films or theatre? Will the great general public accept it? "We've never set out with the sole intention of trying to please people. It's been wonderful that so many have appreciated what we've done. We don't want to come to a point where we wave 'cheerio' to anyone. We want to take them along with us."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul McCartney certainly is more at ease now and much more tolerant and understanding. But he's still searching for something. Whether or not he'll ever find it, I just don't know. But he is determined to, somehow.</p>

<p>"When you don't have to make a living, a job has a different meaning. Most people have to earn a wage to live. If you don't, you take a job to relieve the boredom, but you do something which gives you pleasure."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We enjoy recording, but we want to go even further. I would like to come up with a completely new form of music, invent new sounds. I want to do something, but I don't really know what."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At the moment I'm thinking things out. There seems to be a pause in my life right now... a time for reassessment." I asked Paul if he ever regarded himself as being rather like a retired man of sixty-five, who was now only pottering around, dabbling in his favorite hobby. To a certain extent he was inclined to agree. "I don't regard myself as having retired, but what do most people do when they retire? As you say, they become wrapped up in a hobby. Either that or they find another job."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I would like to do something else, but what that will be, I don't know." Despite the fact that three of the Beatles are married and they are, all four of them, very different individuals, they still have that same bond of loyalty to each other that they have always had. They are still each others' best friends. If they are asked to do something as a group and any one of them doesn't want to take part, then the scheme is dropped. "If three of us wanted to make a film, for instance, and the fourth didn't think it was a good idea, we'd forget about it, because the fourth person would have a very good reason for not wanting to do it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past year Paul has become a much more introspective person. He is constantly striving to discover more about other people. What is depression? Why do people become bored? What is his ultimate goal? These are the questions to which Paul has tried to find the answers in books on meditation and in lectures by men who know more about it than he does. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is playing a big part in developing the Beatle minds. He is the man who gave them strength when they heard of Brian Epstein's tragic death. "I'm more tolerant now than I was, and I feel more at ease myself, but I'm not less certain about many things," said Paul. "In some ways I envy George, because he now has a great faith. He seems to have found what he's been searching for."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When we went to India we were amazed. So many people, living in terrible poverty... but everyone was so happy. They were always laughing and smiling, even though most of them were starving. For people in the Western world to understand why these people can be so happy is a very difficult thing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With John, George, and Ringo, Paul will be flying to India again shortly to study transcendental meditation with Maharishi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To a certain extent, Paul's music is his greatest emotional outlet. "Ravi Shankar discovered himself through his music, and I suppose in many ways we are, too." This is apparent in their latest albums, which feature many tracks based on personal experiences. But how far can one go with any new art form, be it music, films or theatre? Will the great general public accept it? "We've never set out with the sole intention of trying to please people. It's been wonderful that so many have appreciated what we've done. We don't want to come to a point where we wave 'cheerio' to anyone. We want to take them along with us."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul McCartney certainly is more at ease now and much more tolerant and understanding. But he's still searching for something. Whether or not he'll ever find it, I just don't know. But he is determined to, somehow.</p>

<p>Studio Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br />Producer: George Martin<br />Engineer: Geoff Emerick</p>
<p>One of The Beatles' requirements for the Magical Mystery Tour project was the creation of enough music for the soundtrack. In addition to the songs, they also worked on several pieces of incidental music. One of these was Flying, which was recorded on this day under the working title Aerial Tour Instrumental.</p>
<p>Flying had the distinction of being the first Beatles instrumental - wordless chanting aside - to be released, although they had recorded the unreleased <em><strong>Cry For A Shadow</strong></em> and 12-Bar Original. It was also the first to be given a composing credit to all four Beatles.</p>
<p>The group recorded six takes of Flying. The session was led by Paul McCartney, and featured him on bass guitar, John Lennon on organ, George Harrison on guitar and Ringo Starr on drums. Three organ overdubs were then added &ndash; recorded with the tape running backwards &ndash; onto the three remaining tracks.</p>
<p>Two reduction mixes were made to free up two extra tracks on the tape, the best of which was numbered take eight. Lennon then overdubbed the melody on a Mellotron set to the trumpet setting, before all four Beatles added chants.</p>
<p>Flying was given four mono mixes at the end of the session, which ran until 2.45am. The last of these mixes was selected as the best, and was cut onto acetate discs for use in the film production. Interestingly, the mix contains elements later removed, including slide whistle, Mellotron flutes, and the sound of a Dixieland band playing a march &ndash; one of the built-in Mellotron tapes. This early version of Flying ended with a sampled "yeah" spoken by Bill Fransen, one of the creators of the Mellotron.</p>
<p>New mono mixes of Flying were made on 28 September 1967, along with more last-minute overdubs and edits.</p>

<p>Studio Two, EMI Studios, Abbey Road<br />Producer: George Martin<br />Engineer: Geoff Emerick</p>
<p>A productive eight-hour session, which saw work continue on I Am The Walrus, and the beginning of The Fool On The Hill and Blue Jay Way.</p>
<p>The first task was to create a reduction mix of I Am The Walrus, to make room on the tape for further overdubs. The mix was numbered take 17, and combined the previous day's pianet, electric guitar, tambourine and drums. Paul McCartney then recorded a bass guitar part and Ringo Starr added extra snare drum, both played simultaneously onto track three of the four-track tape, and John Lennon overdubbed his lead vocals onto track four.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, radio DJ Kenny Everett, who was present at the session, explained why Lennon's vocals were so raw.</p>
<p>George Martin, their producer, was working with John on the vocal track and he said: 'Look, you've been singing now for about seven hours, you're beginnng to sound hoarse, why don't we do it tomorrow?' John wanted to get it done that day and that's why he sounds so raucous on that track.&nbsp; (Kenny Everett&nbsp; - The Custard Stops At Hatfield)</p>
<p>Four mono mixes of I Am The Walrus were then made for references purposes, only the last of which was complete. Acetate discs were then cut for reference purposes, and one was used for miming during the Magical Mystery Tour film later in the month. Despite this, the song was far from complete, and required a number of other overdubs and edits.</p>
<p>A separate mix was made for 1996's Anthology 2, which combined take 16 from 5 September 1967 with the vocal overdub from this day.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney had written The Fool On The Hill in March 1967, although the lyrics were incomplete at that early stage. During this session he recorded a piano demo in a single take, which was eventually issued on Anthology 2. The song was also cut onto acetate, and work on the song continued on 25 September.</p>
<p>Also recorded on this day was the rhythm track of George Harrison's Blue Jay Way, which was taped in a single take. Harrison played Hammond organ, McCartney was on bass guitar, Starr on drums, and Lennon played a second organ.</p>
<p>Blue Jay Way was given a reduction mix during the next day's session to prepare for further overdubs.</p>

<p>Following the death of Brian Epstein on 27 August 1967, The Beatles regrouped at Paul McCartney's London home on 1 September 1967, where the decision was made to continue work on the Magical Mystery Tour project.</p>
<p>Four days later they began work on one of the soundtrack's highlights, John Lennon's surrealist masterpiece I Am The Walrus. Sixteen takes of the rhythm track were recorded during this session, which began at 7pm and ended at 1am the following morning.</p>
<p>Lennon played a pianet electric piano, McCartney played bass on the initial takes and later switched to tambourine, while George Harrison was on electric guitar and Ringo Starr played drums. Lennon also sang a guide vocal to help the band follow the song.</p>
<p>At this stage there was an extra bar prior to the "Yellow matter custard" verse, which caused the group some problems when performing. They were supposed to play a C major seventh chord during the bar as a transition back to the verse, as heard on Anthology 2, but had trouble remembering the change. The bar was eventually removed during the editing stage.</p>
<p>Eventually The Beatles recorded a satisfactory version - take 16 - which was given further overdubs on the following day. Take 16 featured tambourine on track one, electric guitar on track two, drums on three, and pianet on four.</p>

<p>Paul produced his now-legendary drawing of a Magical Mystery Tour cake sliced up into segments to represent eight essential sequences for inclusion in the film. He had written key words that would prompt him when describing the proposed production to others: Commercial, Introduce Tour, Get On Coach, Courier Introduces, Recruiting, Marathon, Laboratory Sequence, Stripper &amp; Band, End Song? ...</p>
<p>Paul made it clear to me that his aim was to make a feature-length film for full-scale theatrical release and he felt that a successful screen 'tour' would go a long way towards plugging the gaping hole left by the axing of the Fab Four's concert trips. Indeed, if Paul had managed to produce one successful theatrically released feature film with The Beatles each year, a far bigger potential audience would have seen the group than did in the touring years, and the profit margin for the boys would have been enormous.</p>
<p>When the rest arrived he delegated different Beatles to take care of each segment, encouraging them to come up with their own musical and/or comedy content for specific sequences that would last 10 or 15 minutes. He said his concept was based on the old idea of seaside coach trips, mystery tours, 'but this one will have an additional touch of fantasy because four magicians will be at work to make wonderful things happen'. Paul insisted that filming must begin the following week, by which time we'd need to have a big yellow bus organised and decorated, a supporting cast of professional actors and variety artists, the necessary cameramen and technical crew and a route for the bus to take us down to Cornwall, our West Country destination.</p>

<p>Paul produced his now-legendary drawing of a Magical Mystery Tour cake sliced up into segments to represent eight essential sequences for inclusion in the film. He had written key words that would prompt him when describing the proposed production to others: Commercial, Introduce Tour, Get On Coach, Courier Introduces, Recruiting, Marathon, Laboratory Sequence, Stripper &amp; Band, End Song? ...</p>
<p>Paul made it clear to me that his aim was to make a feature-length film for full-scale theatrical release and he felt that a successful screen 'tour' would go a long way towards plugging the gaping hole left by the axing of the Fab Four's concert trips. Indeed, if Paul had managed to produce one successful theatrically released feature film with The Beatles each year, a far bigger potential audience would have seen the group than did in the touring years, and the profit margin for the boys would have been enormous.</p>
<p>When the rest arrived he delegated different Beatles to take care of each segment, encouraging them to come up with their own musical and/or comedy content for specific sequences that would last 10 or 15 minutes. He said his concept was based on the old idea of seaside coach trips, mystery tours, 'but this one will have an additional touch of fantasy because four magicians will be at work to make wonderful things happen'. Paul insisted that filming must begin the following week, by which time we'd need to have a big yellow bus organised and decorated, a supporting cast of professional actors and variety artists, the necessary cameramen and technical crew and a route for the bus to take us down to Cornwall, our West Country destination.</p>

<p>Late on the night of Friday 25 August 1967, The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein was found dead at his home in Chapel Street, London. <span id="more-3030"></span></p>
<p>Epstein had invited his assistant Peter Brown and the chief executive of NEMS, Geoffrey Ellis, to spend the bank holiday weekend at Kingsley Hill, his house in Warbleton, East Sussex. At the time The Beatles were in Bangor, north Wales, with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.</p>
<p>Epstein also asked another assistant, Joanne Newfield, to come, and to bring along a mutual friend, the Scottish singer Lulu. However, both women had prior engagements and declined Epstein's offer. Nonetheless, Epstein departed his London home in good spirits on the afternoon of 25 August, and was joined later in Sussex by Brown and Ellis.</p>
<p>A young man with whom Epstein hoped to become better acquainted did not show up. Epstein was disappointed at the prospect of having to spend the long public holiday with two friends he saw frequently, and following dinner - during which he drank a considerable amount - Epstein chose to drive back to London in his Bentley convertible.</p>
<p>Shortly after Epstein's exit, a London taxi arrived at Kingsley Hill containing four people Epstein had invited. Although surprised that the host had left, they stayed the night at the house, partying with Brown and Ellis.</p>
<p>After lunch on Saturday 26 August, Brown spoke to Epstein on the telephone.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>He called late in the afternoon and was speaking in a woozy voice. He apologized for not coming back and maybe letting us worry. I suspect that when he went back to London he did go out, cruised the West End for a bit and then went home.</p>
<p>I urged him to come back to the country. But there was no way he could drive back because he sounded pretty awful, and I suggested him coming on the train. It was an unlikely thing for him to do but it was the only thing I could think of at the time.</p>
<div class="source">Peter Brown<br /> The Brian Epstein Story, Deborah Geller</div>
<p>Epstein's Spanish butler, Antonio, and his wife Maria, saw their employer when he returned late on the Friday, but heard nothing from him on the Saturday. By the following day they had become worried. They were unable to contact Brown and Ellis, but Antonio did speak to Joanne Newfield. She urged him not to worry, but did decide to go to Chapel Street to check in the early afternoon.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Since it was Sunday, there was no one around and it was a very quick trip across town. I got to Chapel Street, let myself in, found Antonio and went up to Brian's door and knocked on it. There were double doors leading into a dressing room and then there was a single door leading into a bedroom, so there was quite a bit of a distance between the hallway and Brian's room.
<p>I knocked on the door and I called out his name. I called, 'Answer the door. Are you there?' And then I went up to my room and I tried the intercom, and there was no reply...</p>
<p>I knew I didn't want to be there on my own. Antonio and Maria couldn't speak very good English and they were a very shy couple. I needed someone nearer, that could be a support system. So I called Peter back and I told him that Dr Cowan wasn't there and Peter suggested I call his doctor, John Galway. He was there so I told him that I was concerned about Brian and asked if he could come over to the house. He would. And in the meantime I also called a few other people but I couldn't find them. Then I found Alistair [Taylor] and asked him to come to the house.</p>
<p>Then John Galway arrived and we went up to Brian's room, up to the outside doors. Antonio and John Galway broke the doors down. I think in the meantime I'd called Peter back and left the line hanging. Then I went up as they broke the doors down.</p>
<p>Antonio and John Galway were in and I followed them. Maria was staying behind. The curtains were drawn and John Galway was directly ahead of me. I could just see part of Brian in the bed and I was just totally stunned. I knew that something really bad had happened. Then I think John Galway told me, 'Just wait outside.' I stood in the doorway. A few minutes later John Galway came out. I've never seen a doctor so white. We were all white and we knew that Brian had died.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="source">Joanne Newfield<br /> The Brian Epstein Story, Deborah Geller</div>
<p>In the meantime, Brown was waiting on the telephone line. Galway informed him that Epstein had died, and Brown called David Jacobs, a lawyer and friend to Epstein who lived in Brighton. He and Ellis then left for London.</p>
<p>Epstein's personal assistant Alistair Taylor arrived at the house. Those who found Epstein's body were still in a state of shock, and went to the study to have a brandy. They delayed calling the police as they wanted to first make sure there were no illegal substances in the house.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Within literally very few minutes of the police being informed, there's a ring on the doorbell and it's a reporter I knew. He just looked at me and said, 'What are you doing here? I hear Brian's ill.' And I said, 'No, he's fine. He's gone out. He just called me over, actually. You know what he's like, you know, typical Brian. I've come over specially on a Sunday morning and he's gone out in the car.' Then I wondered if the garage door was closed because if the car's sitting there the reporter's going to say, 'Which car?' I was concerned that, before this news broke, somehow we had to get hold of [Epstein's mother] Queenie, and we couldn't find her.</div>

<p>The day after their arrival in Bangor, north Wales, The Beatles attended an introductory seminar given by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, after which they spoke to reporters. <span id="more-3024"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<div>There was a press conference. It was suggested that as we were going with the Maharishi, it might be a good idea to accommodate the press; it also saved them waiting around outside our windows. I don't remember that we specifically said that we'd given up drugs - but at the time I think we probably had, anyway.
<p>The seminar was held in the main hall of the Hugh Owen Buildings, now part of Bangor University. Around 300 people attended. Maharishi joined The Beatles for the press conference afterwards, during which they announced that they had given up taking drugs.</p>
<p>George Harrison: LSD isn't a real answer. It doesn't give you anything. It enables you to see a lot of possibilities that you may never noticed before, but it isn't the answer.

<p>The day after their arrival in Bangor, north Wales, The Beatles attended an introductory seminar given by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, after which they spoke to reporters. <span id="more-3024"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<div>There was a press conference. It was suggested that as we were going with the Maharishi, it might be a good idea to accommodate the press; it also saved them waiting around outside our windows. I don't remember that we specifically said that we'd given up drugs - but at the time I think we probably had, anyway.
<p>The seminar was held in the main hall of the Hugh Owen Buildings, now part of Bangor University. Around 300 people attended. Maharishi joined The Beatles for the press conference afterwards, during which they announced that they had given up taking drugs.</p>
<p>George Harrison: LSD isn't a real answer. It doesn't give you anything. It enables you to see a lot of possibilities that you may never noticed before, but it isn't the answer. You don't just take LSD and that's it forever, you're OK. To get really high, you have to do it straight. I want to get high, and you can't get high on LSD. You can take it and take it as many times as you like, but you get to a point that you can't get any further unless you stop taking it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Following their initial meeting with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on 24 August 1967, The Beatles, along with Cynthia Lennon, Pattie Harrison, her sister Jenny, Alexis Mardas, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull, travelled to Bangor, north Wales, to embark upon a 10-day conference on Transcendental Meditation.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Beatles were to travel on the same train as Maharishi and his party. The resulting press scrum meant that their departure was anything but smooth, however.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was a bright, sunny morning when we set off. I was ready early, but Pattie, George, and Ringo were coming in our car, and were late. By the time Anthony drew up at the station entrance we were cutting it fine and had five minutes to catch the train. John leapt out of the car with the others and ran for the platform - leaving me to follow with our bags. It was the result of years in which he'd taken it for granted that others would see to all the details. I followed him as fast as I could. The station was mayhem, with fans, reporters, police and passengers all milling around. I struggled to push my way through, but when I got to the platform my way was barred by a huge policeman who, unaware that I was with the Beatles party, said, 'Sorry, love, too late, the train's going,' and pushed me aside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I shouted for someone to help. John poked his head out of the train window, saw what was happening and yelled, 'Tell him you're with us! Tell him to let you on.'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was too late. The train was already pulling away from the platform and I was left standing with our bags, tears pouring down my cheeks. It was horribly embarrassing. Reporters were crowding around me, flashbulbs were popping and I felt a complete fool. Peter Brown, Brian's assistant, had come to see us off: he put his arm around me and said he'd take me to Bangor by car. 'We'll probably get there before the train,' he assured me, anxious to cheer me up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But what neither he nor anyone else knew was that my tears were not simply about the missed train. I was crying because the incident seemed symbolic of what was happening to my marriage. John was on the train, speeding into the future, and I was left behind.</span></p>
<div class="source"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cynthia Lennon</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> John</span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Neil Aspinall drove Cynthia to Bangor, in a journey lasting around six hours, and she rejoined The Beatles' party. Aspinall went to see friends staying in a caravan in north Wales, and didn't attend any of Maharishi's lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Beatles, meanwhile, were in a first class compartment, travelling for the first time in many years without their manager Brian Epstein or their assistants Aspinall and Mal Evans. Maharishi was in another first class compartment, seated cross-legged on a white sheet laid out by his followers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As the train approached Bangor The Beatles discussed travelling onto the next station to avoid the waiting camera crews and reporters, and taking taxis to Bangor instead. Maharishi, however, told them they should stick close to him, which they duly did.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Maureen had had the baby and everything was really cool, so we all went to Wales to meet Maharishi. He didn't know who we were then, which was really fabulous. Only when we got off the train and he saw all the kids running, I think then he may have felt, 'Wow, things are looking up for me.' They ran right past him and were looking in our faces, and I think he realised that these boys could get his message across real fast.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The group were staying in dormitories at Bangor college, along with around 300 other followers of Maharishi. The rooms contained bunk beds and basic chests of drawers - a far cry from the comforts The Beatles were used to.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was a bit funny going to those camps because it was like going back to school. Just the nature of it meant staying in a classroom and we'd been used to our nice comfortable homes or hotels so to be staying in an old school on a camp bed was a little bit disconcerting. Then trying to learn to meditate. It's not that easy, you don't just pick it up like that, it's an effort and you've got to be involved, so it was like going back to school. And of course the food was all canteen food. But we were interested enough to learn the system, which we did.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">That evening the group, plus Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull, went to the Senior Chinese restaurant, the only such establishment open late in Bangor. At the end of the meal they realised they didn't have enough money between them to pay the bill.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We went out to a Chinese restaurant in Bangor and ate on our own - just the Beatles, myself, maybe one or two others. When the bill came, we couldn't pay. The Chinese waiter amazingly didn't recognize them, and he was afraid we were going to do a runner. Suddenly, George put his bare foot on the table and opened the sole of his sandal, where he had hidden a &pound;20 note. The Beatles were like the royal family. They didn't have money, didn't use money. But George had put this &pound;20 note there just for this sort of situation.</span></div>

<div class="thecontent">
<p>After spending six days in Los Angeles, George Harrison, his wife Pattie, Neil Aspinall, Derek Taylor and Alexis "Magic Alex" Mardas, flew to San Francisco, where they walked around the hippy district of Haight-Ashbury. <span id="more-6409"></span></p>
The visit to Haight-Ashbury wasn't the purpose of their time in San Francisco; they had gone there to visit Pattie Harrison's sister Jenny Boyd.</div>
<div class="thecontent">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="thecontent">We also went to see my sister Jenny, who was living with a friend in San Francisco. We flew there in a private Lear jet with Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall and were met by a limo, then picked up Jenny, and we all went to have lunch. Afterwards we thought it would be fun to go and have a look at Haight-Ashbury, the district that had been taken over by hippies. Musicians like Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin lived there, and it was the LSD capital of America. On the way, Derek produced a tab. Would we like some? Since we were going to Haight-Ashbury, it seemed silly not to.
<p>The area is named after the intersection of two streets, Haight and Ashbury, and as we approached, the driver said he wouldn't drive down the street itself, he'd park among the side-streets. It seemed a little odd but we didn't argue. We got out of the car, the acid kicked in and everything was just <em>whoah</em>, psychedelic and very... I mean, it was just <em>completely fine</em>. We went into a shop and noticed that all these people were following us. They had recognised George as we walked past them in the street, then turned to follow us. One minute there were five, then ten, twenty, thirty and forty people behind us. I could hear them saying, 'The Beatles are here, the Beatles are in town!'</p>
<p>We were expecting Haight-Ashbury to be special, a creative and artistic place, filled with Beautiful People, but it was horrible - full of ghastly drop-outs, bums and spotty youths, all out of their brains. Everybody looked stoned - even mothers and babies - and they were so close behind us they were treading on the backs of our heels. It got to the point where we couldn't stop for fear of being trampled. Then somebody said, 'Let's go to Hippie Hill,' and we crossed the grass, our retinue facing us, as if we were on stage. They looked as us expectantly - as if George was some kind of Messiah.</p>
<p>We were so high, and then the inevitable happened: a guitar emerged from the crowd and I could see it being passed to the front by outstretched arms. I thought, Oh, God, poor George, this is a nightmare. Finally the guitar was handed to him. I had the feeling that they'd listened to the Beatles' records, analysed them, learnt what they'd thought they should learn, and taken every drug they'd thought the Beatles were singing about. Now they wanted to know where to go next. And George was there, obviously, to give them the answer. Pressure.</p>
<p>George was so cool. He said, 'This is G, this is E, this is D,' and showed them a few chords, then handed back the guitar and said, 'Sorry, man, we've got to go now.' He didn't sing - he couldn't have: he was flying. We all were. I was surprised he could even do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we got up and walked back towards our limo, at which point I heard a little voice say, 'Hey, George, do you want some STP?'</p>
<p>George turned around and said, 'No, thanks, I'm cool, man.'</p>
<p>Then the bloke turned round and said to the others, 'George Harrison turned me down.'</p>
<p>And they went, 'No!'</p>
<p>And then the crowd became faintly hostile. We sensed it because when you're that high you're very aware of vibes, and we were walking faster and faster, and they were following.</p>
<p>When we saw the limo, we ran across the road and jumped in, and they ran after us and started to rock the car, and the windows were full of these faces, flattened against the glass, looking at us.</p>

<div class="thecontent">
<p>After spending six days in Los Angeles, George Harrison, his wife Pattie, Neil Aspinall, Derek Taylor and Alexis "Magic Alex" Mardas, flew to San Francisco, where they walked around the hippy district of Haight-Ashbury. <span id="more-6409"></span></p>
The visit to Haight-Ashbury wasn't the purpose of their time in San Francisco; they had gone there to visit Pattie Harrison's sister Jenny Boyd.</div>
<div class="thecontent">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="thecontent">We also went to see my sister Jenny, who was living with a friend in San Francisco. We flew there in a private Lear jet with Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall and were met by a limo, then picked up Jenny, and we all went to have lunch. Afterwards we thought it would be fun to go and have a look at Haight-Ashbury, the district that had been taken over by hippies. Musicians like Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin lived there, and it was the LSD capital of America. On the way, Derek produced a tab. Would we like some? Since we were going to Haight-Ashbury, it seemed silly not to.
<p>The area is named after the intersection of two streets, Haight and Ashbury, and as we approached, the driver said he wouldn't drive down the street itself, he'd park among the side-streets. It seemed a little odd but we didn't argue. We got out of the car, the acid kicked in and everything was just <em>whoah</em>, psychedelic and very... I mean, it was just <em>completely fine</em>. We went into a shop and noticed that all these people were following us. They had recognised George as we walked past them in the street, then turned to follow us. One minute there were five, then ten, twenty, thirty and forty people behind us. I could hear them saying, 'The Beatles are here, the Beatles are in town!'</p>
<p>We were expecting Haight-Ashbury to be special, a creative and artistic place, filled with Beautiful People, but it was horrible - full of ghastly drop-outs, bums and spotty youths, all out of their brains. Everybody looked stoned - even mothers and babies - and they were so close behind us they were treading on the backs of our heels. It got to the point where we couldn't stop for fear of being trampled. Then somebody said, 'Let's go to Hippie Hill,' and we crossed the grass, our retinue facing us, as if we were on stage.

<div class="source">We went to America in August, a couple of months after the Monterey Pop Festival.

We all went for a day out to see her; Derek and Neil, the not-so-magic Alex, and myself and Pattie. (George Harrison, Anthology)</div>

<p>The Harrisons flew as Mr and Mrs Weiss, names taken from Nat Weiss, the New York director of Nemperor Artists, one of Brian Epstein's co-owned companies.</p>
<p>They stayed in a rented house on Blue Jay Way in Beverly Hills which belonged to the manager of Peggy Lee. George Harrison called Derek Taylor, who was living in the US, giving him directions to the house. However, Taylor got lost in the fog and, while waiting, Harrison wrote the song <em><strong>Blue Jay Way.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="source">Derek Taylor got held up. He rang to say he'd be late. I told him on the phone that the house was in Blue Jay Way. And he said he could find it OK... he could always ask a cop. So I waited and waited. I felt really knackered with the flight, but I didn't want to go to sleep until he came. There was a fog and it got later and later. To keep myself awake, just as a joke to pass the time while I waited, I wrote a song about waiting for him in Blue Jay Way. There was a little Hammond organ in the corner of this house which I hadn't noticed until then... so I messed around on it and the song came. (George Harrison)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Their stay in the house was arranged by Brian Epstein, who called The Beatles' attorney Robert Fitzpatrick to enquire whether a house could be leased. Fitzpatrick persuaded the owner of the house, another entertainment attorney named Ludwig Gerber, to lend Harrison his LA residence.</p>
<p>Ludwig Gerber was a former US Army colonel who had managed Peggy Lee for many years. He was also a film producer and lawyer. In his house there was a Hammond S-6 organ, on which Harrison wrote Blue Jay Way.</p>

<div class="source">Derek Taylor got held up. He rang to say he'd be late. I told him on the phone that the house was in Blue Jay Way. And he said he could find it OK... he could always ask a cop. So I waited and waited. I felt really knackered with the flight, but I didn't want to go to sleep until he came. There was a fog and it got later and later. To keep myself awake, just as a joke to pass the time while I waited, I wrote a song about waiting for him in Blue Jay Way. There was a little Hammond organ in the corner of this house which I hadn't noticed until then... so I messed around on it and the song came. (George Harrison)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Their stay in the house was arranged by Brian Epstein, who called The Beatles' attorney Robert Fitzpatrick to enquire whether a house could be leased. Fitzpatrick persuaded the owner of the house, another entertainment attorney named Ludwig Gerber, to lend Harrison his LA residence.</p>
<p>Ludwig Gerber was a former US Army colonel who had managed Peggy Lee for many years. He was also a film producer and lawyer. In his house there was a Hammond S-6 organ, on which Harrison wrote Blue Jay Way.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>We were all going to live together now, in a huge estate. The four Beatles and Brian would have their network at the centre of the compound: a dome of glass and iron tracery (not unlike the old Crystal Palace) above the mutual creative/play area, from which arbours and avenues would lead off like spokes from a wheel to the four vast and incredibly beautiful separate living units. In the outer grounds, the houses of the inner clique: Neil, Mal, Terry [Doran] and Derek, complete with partners, families and friends. Norfolk, perhaps, there was a lot of empty land there. What an idea! No thought of wind or rain or flood, and as for cold... there would be no more cold when we were through with the world. We would set up a chain reaction so strong that nothing could stand in our way. And why the hell not? 'They've tried everything else,' said John realistically. 'Wars, nationalism, fascism, communism, capitalism, nastiness, religion - none of it works. So why not this?'</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="source">Derek Taylor<br /> Anthology</div>
<p>The main island is often referred to as Leslo, although no island of that name appears to exist. It was apparently surrounded by four smaller islands upon which The Beatles were to have separate villas.</p>
<p>The group, minus Ringo Starr, who had left for England earlier in the day, were taken around the islands to the south of Athens aboard their hired yacht, the MV Arvi. The boat had 24 berths and a crew of eight, including the captain, a chef and two stewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We rented a boat and sailed it up and down the coast from Athens, looking at islands. Somebody had said we should invest some money, so we thought: 'Well, let's buy an island. We'll just go there and drop out.'
<p>It was a great trip. John and I were on acid all the time, sitting on the front of the ship playing ukuleles. Greece was on the left; a big island on the right. The sun was shining and we sang 'Hare Krishna' for hours and hours. Eventually we landed on a little beach with a village, but as soon as we stepped off the boat it started pouring with rain. There were storms and lightning, and the only building on the island was a little fisherman's cottage - so we all piled in: ''Scuse us, squire. You don't mind if we come and shelter in your cottage, do you?'</p>
<p>The island was covered in big pebbles, but Alex (Alexis "Magic Alex" Mardas) said, 'It doesn't matter. We'll have the military come and lift them all off and carry them away.' But we got back on the boat and sailed away, and never thought about the island again.</p>
<p>The Beatles spent the early part of the day island-hopping, swimming, sunbathing and taking drugs. They then visited the island they intended to buy. NEMS employee Alistair Taylor was then sent back to London to arrange its purchase.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We went on the boat and sat around and took acid. It was good fun being with everyone, with nippier moments. For me the pace was a bit wearing. I probably could have done with some straight windows occasionally, I'd have enjoyed it a bit more. But nothing came of that, because we went out there and thought, We've done it now. That was it for a couple of weeks. Great, wasn't it? Now we don't need it. Having been out there, I don't think we needed to go back. Probably the best way to not buy a Greek island is to go out there for a bit.
<p>It's a good job we didn't do it, because anyone who tried those ideas realised eventually there would always be arguments, there would always be who has to do the washing-up and whose turn it is to clean out the latrines. I don't think any of us were thinking of that. (Paul McCartney)</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="source">The Beatles were required to buy special export dollars before applying to the Greek government for permission to spend them. Alistair Taylor eventually got clearance for the purchase of the islands, but by that time the group had moved on. The &pound;90,000-worth of dollars was sold back to the government, and the value had risen giving The Beatles &pound;11,400 profit on the unrealised deal.
<blockquote>
<div>It was about the only time The Beatles ever made any money on a business venture. To make the purchase, we'd changed the money into international dollars or some currency. Then, when they changed the money back, the exchange rate had gone up and so we made about twenty shillings or so. (George Harrison)</div>

<div>Alex invited John on a boat holiday in Greece, and we were all then invited. There was some story of buying a Greek island or something.

The idea was get an island where you can just do what you want, a sort of hippie commune where nobody'd interfere with your lifestyle. I suppose the main motivation for that would probably be no one could stop you smoking.

<p>I think that if you're going to write a great symphony or you're going to rehearse the greatest string quartet in the world, it's fair enough to cut yourself off.

It was a drug-induced ambition, we'd just be sitting around: 'Wouldn't it be great? The lapping water, sunshine, we'd be playing. We'd get a studio there.

<p>Chappell Recording Studios, London<br /> Producers: Chris Barber, Giorgio Gomelsky, Reggie Kind</p>
<p>During the Quarry Men days Paul McCartney had written a jazz-style instrumental titled Catswalk, which was never properly recorded by The Beatles. A rehearsal from late 1962 at the Cavern Club had been recorded, however. <span id="more-6321"></span></p>
<p>McCartney knew band leader Chris Barber, who played trombone with his trad jazz group, The Chris Barber Band, and decided to offer him the song. The band recorded a version at London's Marquee Club in July 1967, but McCartney felt it could be done better.</p>
<p>The session took place on this day at Chappell Recording Studios at 52 Maddox Street, London. The retitled track was recorded as Catcall. The tune was given an over-the-top arrangement complete with a chorus of catcalls: McCartney and Jane Asher were among the people taking part in what was evidently a fun session.</p>
<p>McCartney can also be heard calling "Please play it slower" before the half-speed coda, and singing the chorus of "For he's a jolly good fellow". He is likely to have also played organ on the recording.</p>
<p>Catcall was released as a single in the UK on 20 October 1967, with McCartney given a composer credit. Despite its impeccable pedigree, it failed to chart.</p>

<p>All four members of The Beatles met in London on this day to discuss the Magical Mystery Tour film project, and their plans to purchase an island hideaway in Greece. <span id="more-6390"></span></p>
<p>The Greek island idea was John Lennon's. He had decided that the group and their friends and family should live on the same island, in four separate villas with a recording studio and entertainment complex in the middle. There should, he said, also be housing for staff and visitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We're all going to live there, perhaps forever, just coming home for visits. Or it might just be six months a year. It'll be fantastic, all on our own on this island. There some little houses which we'll do up and knock together and live communally. (John Lennon - Anthology)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexix Mardis, a Greek friend of Lennon's known as Magic Alex, arranged for The Beatles to look for properties in the country. Mardas flew to Greece and found an island, often cited as Leslo, although such an island appears not to exist. The island is said to have had around 80 acres surrounded by four habitable islands, a small fishing village, beaches, 16 acres of olive groves, and was priced at &pound;90,000.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="source">We were all going to live together now, in a huge estate. The four Beatles and Brian would have their network at the centre of the compound: a dome of glass and iron tracery (not unlike the old Crystal Palace) above the mutual creative/play area, from which arbours and avenues would lead off like spokes from a wheel to the four vast and incredibly beautiful separate living units. In the outer grounds, the houses of the inner clique: Neil, Mal, Terry and Derek, complete with partners, families and friends. Norfolk, perhaps, there was a lot of empty land there. What an idea! No thought of wind or rain or flood, and as for cold... there would be no more cold when we were through with the world. We would set up a chain reaction so strong that nothing could stand in our way. And why the hell not? 'They've tried everything else,' said John realistically. 'Wars, nationalism, fascism, communism, capitalism, nastiness, religion - none of it works. So why not this?' (Derek Taylor, Anthology)</div>

<p>With seemingly unstoppable momentum during the summer of 1967, on May 18th, The Beatles signed a contract to represent the BBC, and Britain, on <strong>Our World,</strong> the world's first live television satellite link-up to be seen by approximately 400 million people across five continents. <span id="more-3013"></span></p>
<p>The Beatles' appearance was announced four days later, on May 22nd, John Lennon wrote the song <em><strong>All You Need Is Love </strong></em>especially for the occasion, to the brief given by the BBC: it had to be simple so that viewers around the world would understand it.</p>
<p>"We were big enough to command an audience of that size, and it was for love. It was for love and bloody peace. It was a fabulous time. I even get excited now when I realise that's what it was for: peace and love, people putting flowers in guns." (Ringo Starr)</p>
<p><strong>Our World</strong> took place on June 25, 1967. Between the announcement and the broadcast date, The Beatles recorded the rhythm track and some basic vocals.</p>
<p>The satellite link-up was devised by the BBC, which took the idea to the European Broadcasting Union in 1966. The project editor was BBC executive Aubrey Singer. Personalities, including Maria Callas and Pablo Picasso, from 19 nations performed in separate items from their respective countries. The event, which lasted two-and-a-half hours, had the largest television audience to date.</p>
<p>No politicians or heads of state were allowed to take part in the broadcast, and no pre-recorded videotape or film was allowed. Around 10,000 technicians, producers and translators helped make the event happen; each country had its own announcers, with translators narrating where necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For the first time ever, linking five continents and bringing man face to face with mankind, in places as far apart as Canberra and Cape Kennedy, Moscow and Montreal, Samarkand and S&ouml;derfors, Takamatsu and Tunis.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>National broadcasting companies from 14 countries provided material for the 125-minute programme, which was shown in black-and-white. The organizations involved were: Australia (ABC), Austria (ORF), Canada (CBC), Denmark (DZR), France (ORTF), Italy (RAI), Japan (NHK), Mexico (TS Mexicana), Spain (TVE), Sweden (SRT), Tunisia (RTT), United Kingdom (BBC), USA (NET) and West Germany (ARD), and the programme was also shown - without contributing their own content - in Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Switzerland.</p>
<p>In the week before broadcast, seven Eastern bloc countries - led by the Soviet Union - pulled out, apparently in protest to the Western nations' response to the Six Day War.</p>
<p>The Beatles' day began at 2pm with a camera rehearsal in EMI's Studio One. An outside broadcast van was situated in the studio car park, which relayed the signal around the world via the Intelsat I (Early Bird), Intelsat II (Lana Bird) and ATS-1 satellites.</p>
<p>For the live performance, which took place at 9.36pm GMT, The Beatles played along to their pre-recorded backing track. The vocals, bass guitar, guitar solo, drums and 13-piece orchestra were live. To reduce the chances of on-air errors, the event was carefully arranged, although care was taken to make it seem spontaneous.</p>
<p>The televised sequence of events seem a little corny now and studio tapes reveal the considerable rehearsal time which went into the "spontaneous" performance. Using material taped from 5:00 pm up to the actual live sequence, Steve Race introduced the Beatles playing and singing the basic song, the cameras then cut out to the control room where George Martin suggested it was time to bring the orchestra, the musicians filed in, and Mal Evans got into the picture by collecting empty tea cups.</p>

This album is really a cantata. Teen-agers don't want that. Murray-the-K said the album is positive proof of the Beatles' musical maturity. The reporter spoke to people buying the album at Sam Goody's and at the Colony Record Center. There Lawrence LeFevre lectured about the album: In musical substance, "Sgt. Pepper" is a bigger step forward, from a musical point of view, than "Revolver." New and interesting musical structures appear in combinations of rhythms, chord progressions, instrumentations, and maintaining the flow of melody. This album is a whole, little world created by the Beatles. The Beatles, like Duke Ellington, are unclassifiable musicians.</p>

The reporter spoke to people buying the album at Sam Goody's and at the Colony Record Center. There Lawrence LeFevre lectured about the album: In musical substance, "Sgt. Pepper" is a bigger step forward, from a musical point of view, than "Revolver." New and interesting musical structures appear in combinations of rhythms, chord progressions, instrumentations, and maintaining the flow of melody. This album is a whole, little world created by the Beatles. The Beatles, like Duke Ellington, are unclassifiable musicians.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Paul McCartney was the first British pop star to publicly admit using LSD, in chatting with a reporter who had enquired about it. Paul's LSD quote appeared in Queen, a UK-based magazine at the time. The quote was also then reprinted by Life magazine in their June 16th 1967 feature, 'The New Far-Out Beatles: They're grown men now and creating extraordinary musical sounds' by Thomas Thompson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In both articles, Paul McCartney was quoted as saying, "After I took it (LSD), it opened my eyes. We only use one-tenth of our brain. Just think what we could accomplish if we could only tap that hidden part. It would mean a whole new world."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITV seized the opportunity to interview Paul about this public admission. The controversy would become a springboard for discussing the responsibilities of celebrities and journalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The following interview was filmed by ITV on June 19th 1967, in Paul's backyard garden on Cavendish Avenue, and would be telecast in Britain later that evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Paul had just celebrated his 25th birthday the previous day. The Beatles' latest LP 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' was number one on the album charts -- released less than three weeks prior on June 1st.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Q:</strong> "Paul, how often have you taken LSD?"</span></p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> (pause) "About four times."</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> "And where did you get it from?"</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> "Well, you know, if I was to say where I got it from, you know, I mean... it's illegal and everything... it's silly to say that, you know. So I'd rather not say that."</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> "Don't you believe that this is a matter which you should have kept private?"</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> "Mmm, but the thing is -- I was asked a question by a newspaper, and the decision was whether to tell a lie or tell him the truth. I decided to tell him the truth... but I really didn't want to say anything, you know, because if I had my way I wouldn't have told anyone. I'm not trying to spread the word about this. But the man from the newspaper is the man from the mass medium. I'll keep it a personal thing if he does too you know... if he keeps it quiet. But he wanted to spread it so it's his responsibility, you know, for spreading it not mine."</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> "But you're a public figure and you said it in the first place and you must have known it would make the newspaper."</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> "Yeah, but to say it is only to tell the truth. I'm telling the truth, you know. I don't know what everyone's so angry about."</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> "Do you think that you have now encouraged your fans to take drugs?"</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> (clearly and calmly) "I don't think it'll make any difference. I don't think my fans are going to take drugs just because I did, you know. But the thing is -- that's not the point anyway. I was asked whether I had or not. And from then on, the whole bit about how far it's gonna go and how many people it's going to encourage is up to the newspapers, and up to you on television. I mean, you're spreading this now, at this moment. This is going into all the homes in Britain. And I'd rather it didn't. But you're asking me the question -- You want me to be honest -- I'll be honest."</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> "But as a public figure, surely you've got the responsibility to..."</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> "...No, it's you who've got the responsibility. You've got the responsibility not to spread this NOW. You know, I'm quite prepared to keep it as a very personal thing if you will too. If you'll shut up about it, I will." <br /><br /></p>

<p>The only common instrument in the other four parts was McCartney's piano. Part two was recorded in 12 takes; part three in four; part four in six takes; and the final part in a single attempt.</p>
<p>Brian Jones performed on two parts: a ska section with piano, drums, guitar and saxophone, and a jazz rendition featuring piano, drums, guitar, saxophone, bass guitar and vibraphone.</p>
<p>Also recorded was a nightclub section in a rhumba style featuring piano, drums, maracas and congas; and the final part had bongos and piano playing alongside various comedic sound effects including bird whistles and quacking sounds. The session ended at 1am on the morning of 9 June 1967.</p>

<p>The third recording session for <strong><em>You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) </em></strong>was one of the most interesting, involving a guest appearance from a Rolling Stone, and the recording of four separate parts of the song. <span id="more-6302"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">Paul McCartney had invited Brian Jones of the Stones to the session, although it was expected that he would bring his normal musical instrument.</div>
<blockquote>
<div>It was Brian Jones of the Stones. He turned up very, very nervous with a sax, and we said 'Oh, we thought you'd bring a guitar!' and he'd brought a sax. I invited him to the session. Absolutely definitely Brian of the Stones. Unequivocably, as they say.</div>

<p>Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr had first seen The Jimi Hendrix Experience performing in January 1967 at the Bag O'Nails club in London. On this day McCartney and George Harrison watched them headline a bill at the city's Saville Theatre. <span id="more-6382"></span></p>
<p>The bill also included Denny Laine &amp; His Electric String Band, The Chiffons and Procol Harum. Hendrix opened his set with a version of the title track from The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, which had been released just three days before.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It would be one of his first gigs in London. Jimi was a sweetie, a very nice guy. I remember him opening at the Saville on a Sunday night, 4 June 1967. Brian Epstein used to rent it when it was usually dark on the Sunday. Jimi opened, the curtains flew back and he came walking forward, playing 'Sgt. Pepper', and it had only been released on the Thursday so that was like the ultimate compliment. It's still obviously a shining memory for me, because I admired him so much anyway, he was so accomplished. To think that that album had meant so much to him as to actually do it by the Sunday night, three days after the release. He must have been so into it, because normally it might take a day for rehearsal and then you might wonder whether you'd put it in, but he just opened with it. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career. I mean, I'm sure he wouldn't have thought of it as an honour, I'm sure he thought it was the other way round, but to me that was like a great boost.</div>

She was there with the Animals, who she knew from photographing them in New York. They were sitting a couple of alcoves down, near the stage. The band had finished and they got up to either leave or go for a drink or a pee or something, and she passed our table. I was near the edge and stood up just as she was passing, blocking her exit. And so I said, 'Oh, sorry. Hi. How are you? How're you doing?' I introduced myself, and said, 'We're going on to another club after this, would you like to join us?'</p>
<p>That was my big pulling line! Well, I'd never used it before, of course, but it worked this time! It was a fairly slim chance but it worked. She said, 'Yes, okay, we'll go on. How shall we do it?' I forget how we did it. 'You come in our car' or whatever, and we all went on, the people I was with and the Animals, we went on to the Speakeasy.</p>

<p>The Speakeasy was a club on Margaret Street, where they heard Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale for the first time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We flirted a bit, and then it was time for me to go back with them and Paul said, 'Well, we're going to another club. You want to come?' I remember everybody at the table heard A Whiter Shade Of Pale that night for the first time and we all thought, Who is that? Stevie Winwood? We all said Stevie. The minute that record came out, you just knew you loved it. That's when we actually met. Then we went back to his house. We were in the Mini with I think Lulu and Dudley Edwards, who painted Paul's piano; Paul was giving him a lift home. I was impressed to see his Magrittes.</span></p>

And so I said, 'Oh, sorry. Hi. How are you? How're you doing?' I introduced myself, and said, 'We're going on to another club after this, would you like to join us?'</p>
<p>That was my big pulling line! Well, I'd never used it before, of course, but it worked this time! It was a fairly slim chance but it worked. She said, 'Yes, okay, we'll go on. How shall we do it?' I forget how we did it. 'You come in our car' or whatever, and we all went on, the people I was with and the Animals, we went on to the Speakeasy.</p>

<p>The Speakeasy was a club on Margaret Street, where they heard Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale for the first time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We flirted a bit, and then it was time for me to go back with them and Paul said, 'Well, we're going to another club. You want to come?' I remember everybody at the table heard A Whiter Shade Of Pale that night for the first time and we all thought, Who is that? Stevie Winwood? We all said Stevie. The minute that record came out, you just knew you loved it. That's when we actually met. Then we went back to his house. We were in the Mini with I think Lulu and Dudley Edwards, who painted Paul's piano; Paul was giving him a lift home. I was impressed to see his Magrittes.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<div>I'm a terrible pusher on sessions. I do a lot of orchestral work and you naturally push people along. The Beatles said that this was the fastest record they'd ever made. They were used to a much more leisurely pace. We started the session at about 9pm and it was finished and mixed by about 3am, vocals and everything. They kept playing, version after version, then we spooled back to the one they liked and overdubbed the vocals</div>

<p>Two reduction mixes were then made to free up space on the tape. The second, known as take two, had George Harrison's lead guitar and Lennon's Clavioline introduction overdubbed onto track three.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">he final touch was added to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band during this session: the gibberish sounds which filled the run-out groove of the vinyl record. <br /></span></p>
<p>First of all, however, 11 mono mixes of George Harrison's <em><strong>Only A Northern Song</strong></em> were made. Two four-track tapes had been filled: one with organ, bass guitar, trumpet, glockenspiel and drums, and another with organ, vocals and other assorted noises.</p>
<p>Two tape machines therefore needed to be synchronised, a process that had previously been used during the recording of <em><strong>A Day In The Life.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once the mixes were complete, attention returned to Sgt Pepper. The Beatles stood at the studio microphone and babbled nonsense on each track of a two-track tape, which was subsequently cut up and re-edited with some parts reversed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>On 21 April everyone in the studio recorded the run-on spiral for the album, about two seconds&rsquo; worth of sound. It was a triple session - three three-hour sessions - which ended around 4am. The Beatles stood around two microphones muttering, singing snatches of songs and yelling for what seemed like hours, with the rest of us standing round them, joining in. Mal carried in cases of Coke and bottles of Scotch. Ringo was out of it. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so stoned,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to fall over!&rsquo; As he slowly toppled, Mal [Evans] caught him and popped him neatly in a chair without a murmur. In the control room no one seemed to notice. A loop was made from the tape of the muttering and was mixed, but not without some altercation between John and the tape operator.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="source">Barry Miles<br /> In The Sixties</div>
<p>The album was cut by Harry Moss, and required several attempts before the sound appeared precisely in the run-out groove. The intention was for the sound to loop and be played <em>ad infinitum</em>, preceded by a 15 kilocycle pitch intended for dogs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I was told by chaps who'd been in the business a long time that cutting things into the run-out grooves was an old idea that they used to do on 78s. Cutting Sgt Pepper was not too difficult except that because we couldn't play the masters I had to wait for white label pressings before I could hear whether or not I'd cut the concentric groove successfully, These were the things which, at the time, I used to swear about! It was George Martin who first asked me to do it. I replied, 'It's gonna be bloody awkward, George, but I'll give it a go!'</div>

<p>In the afternoon the pair visited John and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas And The Papas. After a while McCartney left alone to meet The Beach Boys, leaving Evans with the Phillipses.</p>
<p>At the time Brian Wilson was working on the song Vegetables, intended for the Smile album but eventually released on Smiley Smile. McCartney was recorded chewing celery.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The night before a big tour, I was out in the studio recording the vocal when, to my surprise, Paul McCartney walked in and joined Brian at the console. And, briefly, the two most influential musical Geminis in the world had a chance to work together. I remember waiting for long periods of time between takes to get to the next section or verse. Brian lost track of the session. Paul would come on the talkback and say something like 'Good take, Al.'</div>

<div class="source">The Beach Boys</div>
<p>McCartney also performed on an unreleased version of On Top Of Old Smokey. Shortly after midnight he arrived back at the Phillipses' house.</p>

</header>
<p>Paul McCartney had flown to the United States on April 4, 1967, to surprise Jane Asher on her 21st birthday. Afterwards they spent several days together. <span id="more-6367"></span></p>
<p>In the morning Evans took McCartney's camera to be repaired at a shop in Denver, Colorado, where they were staying. After returning the mended camera to its owner he went to the Civic Center park where he spent some time at the Greek amphitheatre.</p>
<p>In the afternoon McCartney filmed Asher walking among trees. It was on this day that he had the idea for a television special, which subsequently became the Magical Mystery Tour project.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I used to do a lot of amateur filming and from my interest in that it was a very small step for me to say, 'Well, if we hired a film cameraman and we told him where to shoot, then we're starting to film, aren't we? As long as we know that we want to go over Westminster Bridge backwards, he'll be able to do that. I can convey it to him.' So, the idea tumbled together that we'd hire a bus, take a bunch of people out and start trying to make up something about a magical mystery tour.
<p>It used to just be called a mystery tour, up north. When we were kids, you'd get on a bus, and you didn't know where you were going, but nearly always it was Blackpool. From Liverpool, it was inevitably Blackpool and everyone would go, 'Oooo, it was Blackpool after all!' Everyone would spend time guessing where they were going, and this was part of the thrill. And we remembered those. So much of the Beatles' stuff was a slight switch on a memory; in Penny Lane, the nurse and the barber and the fireman were just people we saw on a bus route, but this time they'd be with us. So we'd always just heighten the reality to make a little bit of surreality. That we were interested in.</p>

<p>The sound effects for <strong>Good Morning Good Morning</strong>, assembled on the previous day, were added to the song during this session. <span id="more-6254"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">The effects were dubbed onto the vocal track of the tape. After this the song was complete, and it was mixed in mono and stereo on April 6, 1967.</div>

<p>The Beatles began a new song on this evening. <em><strong>With A Little Help From My Friends </strong></em>was written for Ringo Starr to sing, and was known during this session only as Bad Finger Boogie.</p>
<p>From the beginning it was intended that the song would segue from the <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> title track, and recording began with the "Billy Shears" line.</p>
<p>The Beatles began by recording the rhythm track in 10 takes, the last of which was the best. It had Paul McCartney on piano on track one, George Harrison's rhythm guitar on two, Starr's drums and cowbell played by John Lennon on three, and George Martin playing organ on track four.</p>
<p>A reduction mix, numbered take 11, made free some space on the tape for further overdubs. Starr then added his lead vocals to tracks three and four, with backing vocals by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.

<p>This session saw work continue on two Sgt. Pepper songs: Getting Better and Lovely Rita. It was perhaps more notable for being the one time when John Lennon took LSD in the recording studio.</p>
<p>Visitors to the studio on this occasion included music publisher Dick James, NEMS employee Peter Brown, and Ivan Vaughan, who had introduced John Lennon and Pal McCartney for the first time on July 6, 1957.</p>
<p>Also present was journalist and writer Hunter Davies, who had recently been commissioned to write The Beatles' authorised biography. His book, simply titled The Beatles, was published in September 1968 and documented a number of recording and songwriting sessions for the Sgt Pepper album.</p>
<p>The backing track for Getting Better had been recorded on March 9th and 10th, Ringo Starr was not needed on this evening so didn't attend.</p>
<p>The session began with a playback of the progress so far. McCartney was the most actively-engaged of the group, discussing with balance engineer Geoff Emerick on how the song should sound.</p>
<p>Two reduction mixes, numbered 13 and 14, were made to free space on the four-track tape. These mixes put the 9 March rhythm track and the tambura on one track, and bass guitar and drum overdubs on track two.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>George Harrison and Ivan [Vaughan] went off to chat in a corner, but Paul and John listened carefully. Paul instructed the technician on which levers to press, telling him what he wanted, how it should be done, which bits he liked best. George Martin looked on, giving advice where necessary. John stared into space...
<p>They played the backing track of It's Getting Better [<em>sic</em>] for what seemed like the hundredth time, but Paul said he wasn't happy about it. They'd better get Ringo in and they would do it all again. Someone went to ring for Ringo.</p>
<p>Peter Brown arrived... They played him the backing track of It's Getting Better. As it was being played, Paul talked to one of the technicians and told him to try yet a different sound mix. He did so and Paul said that was much better. It would do. They didn't need to bring Ringo in now after all.</p>
<p>'And we've just ordered Ringo on toast,' said John. But Ringo was cancelled in time and the studio was got ready to record the sound track, the voices... The three of them held their heads round one microphone and sang It's Getting Better while up in the control box, George Martin and his two assistants got it all down on track. The three Beatles were singing, not playing, but through the headphones strapped to their ears they could hear the recording of the backing track. They were simply singing to their already recorded accompaniment.</p>
<p>In the studio itself, all that could be heard were the unaccompanied, un-electrified voices of the Beatles singing, without any backing. It all sounded flat and out of key.</p>
</div>

<div class="source">The Beatles<br /> Hunter Davies</div>
<p>The vocals were re-recorded, more successfully, on March 23, 1967. The Beatles' involvement in this session, meanwhile, drew to a close once John Lennon began to feel the effects of a tab of LSD he had mistakenly ingested.</p>
<p>Lennon carried with him a small silver art nouveau pill box which he had bought from Liberty of London. He kept a range of stimulants inside the box, and was in the habit of taking it out and selecting different drugs to take.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We were overdubbing voices on one of the Pepper tracks, and John, down in the studio, was obviously feeling unwell. I called over the intercom, 'What's the matter, John? Aren't you feeling very well?'
<p>'No,' said John.</p>
<p>I went down and looked at him, and he said, 'I don't know. I'm feeling very strange.'</p>
<p>He certainly looked very ill, so I told him, 'You need some fresh air. Let's leave the others working, and I'll take you outside.'</p>
<p>The problem was where to go; there were the usual five hundred or so kids waiting for us at the front, keeping vigil like guard-dogs, and if we had dared to appear at the entrance there would have been uproar and they would probably have broken the gates down. So I took him up to the roof, above Number Two studio. I remember it was a lovely night, with very bright stars. Then I suddenly realised that the only protection around the edge of the roof was a parapet about six inches high, with a sheer drop of some ninety feet to the ground below, and I had to tell him, 'Don't go too near the edge, there's no rail there, John.' We walked around the roof for a while. Then he agreed to come back downstairs, and we packed up for the night.</p>
<p>It wasn't until much later that I learned what had happened. John was in the habit of taking pills, 'uppers', to give him the energy to get through the night. That evening, he had taken the wrong pill by mistake - a very large dose of LSD. But Paul knew, and went home with him and turned on as well, to keep him company. It seems they had a real trip. I knew they smoked pot, and I knew they took pills, but in my innocence I had no idea they were also into LSD.</p>
</div>

<div class="source">George Martin<br /> All You Need Is Ears</div>
<p>Although they occasionally smoked cannabis during recording sessions, The Beatles never intentionally took acid while working.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I never took it in the studio. Once I did accidentally. I thought I was taking some uppers, and I was not in a state of handling it. I can't remember what album it was but I took it and then [<em>whispers</em>] I just noticed all of a sudden I got so scared on the mike. I said, 'What was it?' I thought I felt ill. I thought I was going cracked. Then I said, 'I must get some air.' They all took me upstairs on the roof, and George Martin was looking at me funny. And then it dawned on me, I must have taken acid. And I said, 'Well, I can't go on, I have to go.' So I just said, 'You'll have to do it and I'll just stay and watch.' I just [became] very nervous and just watching all of a sudden. 'Is it alright?' And they were saying, 'Yeah.' They were all being very kind. They said, 'Yes, it's alright.' And I said, 'Are you sure it's alright?' They carried on making the record.</div>

<p>In the studio itself, all that could be heard were the unaccompanied, un-electrified voices of the Beatles singing, without any backing. It all sounded flat and out of key.</p>

<p>The vocals were re-recorded, more successfully, on March 23, 1967. The Beatles' involvement in this session, meanwhile, drew to a close once John Lennon began to feel the effects of a tab of LSD he had mistakenly ingested.</p>
<p>Lennon carried with him a small silver art nouveau pill box which he had bought from Liberty of London. He kept a range of stimulants inside the box, and was in the habit of taking it out and selecting different drugs to take.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We were overdubbing voices on one of the Pepper tracks, and John, down in the studio, was obviously feeling unwell. I called over the intercom, 'What's the matter, John? Aren't you feeling very well?'
<p>'No,' said John.</p>
<p>I went down and looked at him, and he said, 'I don't know. I'm feeling very strange.'</p>
<p>He certainly looked very ill, so I told him, 'You need some fresh air. Let's leave the others working, and I'll take you outside.'</p>
<p>The problem was where to go; there were the usual five hundred or so kids waiting for us at the front, keeping vigil like guard-dogs, and if we had dared to appear at the entrance there would have been uproar and they would probably have broken the gates down. So I took him up to the roof, above Number Two studio. I remember it was a lovely night, with very bright stars. Then I suddenly realised that the only protection around the edge of the roof was a parapet about six inches high, with a sheer drop of some ninety feet to the ground below, and I had to tell him, 'Don't go too near the edge, there's no rail there, John.' We walked around the roof for a while. Then he agreed to come back downstairs, and we packed up for the night.</p>
<p>It wasn't until much later that I learned what had happened. John was in the habit of taking pills, 'uppers', to give him the energy to get through the night. That evening, he had taken the wrong pill by mistake - a very large dose of LSD. But Paul knew, and went home with him and turned on as well, to keep him company. It seems they had a real trip. I knew they smoked pot, and I knew they took pills, but in my innocence I had no idea they were also into LSD.</p>

<div class="source">George Martin<br /> All You Need Is Ears</div>
<p>Although they occasionally smoked cannabis during recording sessions, The Beatles never intentionally took acid while working.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I never took it in the studio. Once I did accidentally. I thought I was taking some uppers, and I was not in a state of handling it. I can't remember what album it was but I took it and then [<em>whispers</em>] I just noticed all of a sudden I got so scared on the mike. I said, 'What was it?' I thought I felt ill. I thought I was going cracked. Then I said, 'I must get some air.' They all took me upstairs on the roof, and George Martin was looking at me funny. And then it dawned on me, I must have taken acid. And I said, 'Well, I can't go on, I have to go.' So I just said, 'You'll have to do it and I'll just stay and watch.' I just [became] very nervous and just watching all of a sudden. 'Is it alright?' And they were saying, 'Yeah.' They were all being very kind. They said, 'Yes, it's alright.' And I said, 'Are you sure it's alright?' They carried on making the record.</div>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Beatles deliberately kept themselves very much to themselves during the recording of <strong><em>Sgt.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Mathew's purpose was two-fold. He recorded John and Paul's acceptance speech for three 1966 Ivor Novello awards - for <em><strong>Yellow Submarine</strong></em> and for <em><strong>Yesterday</strong></em>. These speeches were broadcast by the BBC Light Program on March 27th. The event was otherwise recorded live, before a music industry audience, at the Playhouse Theatre in London on March 23rd. John and Paul had no wish to attend so their three statuettes were received on their behalf by NEMS' Tony Barrow and by Ron White, the general manager of marketing services at EMI Records. After each presentation, the relevant "Thank You" speech by John and Paul was played over the PA (and dropped into the program), following which the song was performed live at the playhouse by Joe Loss and his Orchestra. (the lead vocal on "Michelle" was sung by Ross MacManus, father of Declan, aka Elvis Costello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Up to 1970, John and Paul won several Ivor Novello awards too, in presentation ceremonies, also broadcast by BBC radio, but they never again recorded a special interview, nor did they receive the awards in person. George Martin and Dick James accepted them on their behalf and made short speeches. The secondary visit of Brian Matthew's visit to EMI studios this evening was to record a brief addtional interview with John and Paul for exclusive use by the BBC's Transcription service in its weekly best of <strong><em>Top Of The Pops,</em></strong> sold by subscription to overseas stations. It was only a brief interview, for which precisely four minutes were used, although John and Paul had ample time to explain the Beatle's change in direction towards recording and away from touring- John in particular being emphatic about there being no more concert tours, succinctly saying that there be no more "She Loves You". </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">After the interview, John and Paul devoted the remainder of the session to "She's Leaving Home", overdubbing vocals onto take nine (a reduction of the previous night's take one). This lovely song was now complete because there were no overdubs of any of the Beatles playing an musical instrument: the only music playing on "She's Leaving Home" was the strings. The recording was then mixed onto mono before the close of play at 3:30 am.</span></p>

<p>Recording began on the Sgt. Pepper song <em><strong>She's Leaving Home </strong></em>during this session. <span id="more-6204"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">The song had been written after Pau McCartney read a report about a teenage runaway named Melanie Coe in the 27 February 1967 edition of the Daily Mail newspaper. John Lennon contributed the chorus lines, and the pair decided that a string arrangement would suit it.</div>

Martin saw the move as a slight, but later acknowledged that McCartney's impatience had been the key factor.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>During the making of Pepper [Paul] was also to give me one of the biggest hurts of my life. It concerned the song She's Leaving Home. At that time I was still having to record all my other artists. One day Paul rang me to say: 'I've got a song I want you to work with me on. Can you come round tomorrow afternoon? I want to get it done quickly. We'll book an orchestra, and you can score it.'<br /> 'I can't tomorrow, Paul. I'm recording Cilla [Black] at two-thirty.'<br /> 'Come on. You can come round at two o'clock.'<br /> 'No, I can't, I've got a session on.'<br /> 'All right, then,' he said, and that ended the conversation.
<p>What he did then, as I discovered later, was to get Neil Aspinall, the road manager, to ring round and find someone else to do the score for him, simply because I couldn't do it at that short notice. In the end he found Mike Leander, who could. The following day Paul presented me with it and said, 'Here we are. I've got a score. We can record it now.'</p>
<p>I recorded it, with a few alterations to make it work better, but I was hurt. I thought: Paul, you could have waited. For I really couldn't have done it that afternoon, unless I had just devoted everything to The Beatles and never dealt with any other artist. Paul obviously didn't think it was important that I should do everything. To me it was. I wasn't getting much out of it from a financial point of view, but at least I was getting satisfaction. The score itself was good enough, and still holds up today, but it was the only score that was ever done by anyone else during all my time with The Beatles.</p>

<p>The Beatles began recording a new Sgt. Pepper song during this session: Getting Better. <span id="more-6198"></span></p>
<div class="amazon">The group recorded the song's rhythm track in seven takes. Paul McCartney's rhythm guitar and Ringo Starr's drums went onto track one of the tape, and McCartney's guide vocals were on the second. George Martin hit the strings of an electric keyboard called a pianette on track three, and Starr added more drums to the fourth.</div>
<p>The tape was then subjected to a reduction mix to free up more space. This took five attempts, numbered takes 8-12, with the guide vocals omitted.</p>
<p>This was one of the few Sgt Pepper sessions in which Geoff Emerick did not work as the studio balance engineer. He and tape operator Richard Lush were given the night off, and were replaced by two other EMI staffers, Malcolm Addey assisted by Ken Townsend.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Geoff had been doing a lot of late-night work and was getting very tired. I remember the session was booked to begin at 7pm but there was barely a Beatle in sight before midnight, and we were sitting around waiting. They eventually straggled in one by one. Ringo came in about 11 and ordered fish and chips. The others arrived later, they all hung around and finally started work at about one in the morning. The ego trip of the big-time artists had started to set in.</div>
