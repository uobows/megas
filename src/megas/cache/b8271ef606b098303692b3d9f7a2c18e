I mean, it's not like there's any aggressive counter-programming going on, and I can only watch my <a href="http://www.kathandkim.com/">Kath &amp; Kim</a> DVDs so many times.  But each time one of the female contestants gets up to screech and wail (Hey!  If you get near a melody, <i>sing it!</i>), I can't help but time travel in my mind back to 1981 and think that a 17-year old Rachel Sweet would absolutely <b>demolish</b> them all.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uVUja9RmNAU/ReYSZYOrEfI/AAAAAAAAACE/BvDJk72DWyw/s1600-h/rachel.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uVUja9RmNAU/ReYSZYOrEfI/AAAAAAAAACE/BvDJk72DWyw/s400/rachel.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5036733460470501874" border="0" /></a><i>...Then He Kissed Me</i> was Sweet's third album and her first for major label Columbia Records after releasing two albums on legendary UK New Wave label Stiff Records.  Sweet's Stiff releases started out with a country twang and veered more towards guitar-based New Wave near the end, all wrapped in a Lolita Jailbait presentation, but <i>...Then He Kissed Me</i> blended current Top 40 sounds with classic 60s girl group trappings.  This came to a head with the album's big hit single, a remake of "Everlasting Love", re-imagined as a duet with Rex Smith (urgh).  Columbia's plan to break Sweet in America was reaching its shmaltzy fruition.<br /><br />Things were much more pleasing on the follow-up single - hey, if a remake worked, let's release TWO of them as a medley! - a melding of the Phil Spector classics <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Then%20He%20Kissed%20Me_Be%20My%20Baby.mp3">"Then He Kissed Me/Be My Baby"</a>.  Imagine seeing <i>this</i> on "American Idol":<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMUJ89OBtkc&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMUJ89OBtkc&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Simon would be arrested for statutory rape within minutes.  Unfortunately, the second single didn't match the success of "Everlasting Love", even with the Rex factor removed.  Columbia must have had faith in those heady days of artist development, when a label would work an album even if a single flopped, since a third single was sent to radio stations, this one an original composition by D.L. Byron (Rachel gets a co-writing credit here that I haven't seen anywhere else) - a little Jim Steinman-eque ditty called "Shadows Of The Night".<br /><br />Yes, <i>that</i> "Shadows Of The Night".  A full year before Pat Benatar made it a huge hit and it won the 1982 Grammy for Best Song. <br /><br />Sweet's version of <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Shadows%20Of%20The%20Night.mp3">"Shadows Of The Night" </a>(subtle, but telling lyric difference - in Sweet's version, she and her lover are running "<i>thru</i> the shadows of the night", not "with" them as in Benatar's version) is nowhere near as bombastic and overblown as Benatar's, and maybe that's why it didn't click with Top 40.  It is, however, a bit more honest and heart-rending than Pat's, and definitely stands on its own merits.  The rest of the album is a keeper, too.<br /><br />Sweet went on to record a final album for Columbia, which we'll get to at some point.  These days, she's behind the scenes, working as a producer for television shows like "The George Lopez Show".  But just imagine if "Idol" was around in 1981...<br /><br /><i>Neither song charted.</i><br /><br /><b>Get Rachel Sweet music at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=rachel%20sweet&amp;tag=lostinthe8005-20&amp;index=music&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> or on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=pgCWrmzny1o&amp;offerid=78941&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewArtist%253Fid%253D62048120%2526partnerId%253D30"><br /> <img alt="Rachel Sweet" src="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif" height="15" width="61" /><br /></a></b>";s:12:"link_replies";s:161:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/331604462288596267/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=331604462288596267&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/331604462288596267";s:9:"link_self";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/331604462288596267";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/08/night-we-met-i-knew-i-needed-you-so-and.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:2;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-3823156787539700066";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-08-24T18:27:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-08-24T18:38:41.992-07:00";s:5:"title";s:77:""AM/PM, pyramid, roxy, mudd club, danceteria / the newest club is opening up"";s:12:"atom_content";s:3103:"<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uVUja9RmNAU/RdTowlKZkwI/AAAAAAAAAAw/6Qp9GAv2DsU/s1600-h/fearless.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uVUja9RmNAU/RdTowlKZkwI/AAAAAAAAAAw/6Qp9GAv2DsU/s400/fearless.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5031902604986782466" border="0" /></a>This week's hottest reissue has to be Nina Hagen's 1983 classic "Fearless", coming to CD for the very first time.

Wrapping Hagen's alternately hiccup-y and operatic vocals with early hip-hop and dance beats did the trick quite nicely, as single <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/New%20York%20New%20York.mp3">"New York New York"</a> got Miss Freak on MTV and in hipper dance clubs everywhere.

Let's start at the beginning - after <a href="http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2005/08/its-raining-my-sisters-why-cant-we.html">Morris Day left The Time</a> in 1984, Prince tapped "St. Paul" Peterson as his replacement, causing guitarist Jesse Johnson to hit the road as well.  Left with a drummer, a bass player and a valet ("Now, now, Jerome!"), Prince had Revolution guitarist Wendy's sister, Susannah Melvoin join the band, and rounded out the strange quintet with saxophonist Eric Leeds.  <br /><br /><b>Good Decision #1:</b>  Changing the band's name from The Time to The Family.  No one would have ever accepted St. Paul as a replacement for Morris Day.  I mean, <i>really</i>.<br /><br /><b>Bad Decision #1:</b>  Trying to maintain some of the same funk The Time was famous for, most notably on songs like <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Mutiny.mp3">"Mutiny"</a>, making The Family come off as more of a dry run for Wa Wa Nee.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/291374/family.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/851931/family.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><b>Good Decision #2:</b>  Creating a unique "Family" sound for their self-titled LP, drenched in strings and minor keys on songs like <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/River Run Dry.mp3">"River Run Dry"</a> and the first single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Screams of Passion (Extended Version).mp3">"Screams of Passion"</a> represented here in its 12" version.<br /><br /><div><object width="480" height="381"><param name="movie" value="http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/x61wxl_the-family-screams-of-passion_creation&related=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/x61wxl_the-family-screams-of-passion_creation&related=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="381" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always"></embed></object><br /><b><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x61wxl_the-family-screams-of-passion_creation">The Family Screams of Passion</a></b><br /></div><br /><br /><b>Bad Decision #2:</b>  Picking "Screams of Passion" as the first single when you had, wait for it, the original version of <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Nothing Compares 2 U.mp3">"Nothing Compares 2 U"</a> sitting there nice and all polite-like on Side Two.  This even more melodramatic and provocative version could have been a major hit six years earlier than when Sinead O'Connor's take on it took it to the #1 position.<br /><br /><b>Bad Decision #3:</b>  Pulling the plug on the whole thing without recording a second album or playing more than one live date.  The Family, for all its Prince-ness, was a fairly unique corner of the Paisley Park empire - it would have been interesting to see what a second album would have brought.<br /><br />Maybe we'll get that chance, since The Family, all five members, have announced <a href="http://www.myspace.com/allthewayvogue">they're reuniting</a> for a tour and new album.  Is this a Good Decision or a Bad Decision?  Time (heh) will tell.  At least Jerome's involved!  A Family reunion without Jerome would be like a Happy Mondays reunion without Bez.<br /><br />And so ends Prince Proteges Month.  Don't worry - there are tons more we can talk about in the future.  I didn't even get to Jill Jones, Mazarati, Apollonia 6, Jesse Johnson's Revue, et al.  Stick around.  We have a few years to get to 'em.<br /><br /><i>"Screams of Passion" peaked at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100, #9 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles and #10 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1985.</i><br /><br /><b>"The Family" is out of print.</b>";s:12:"link_replies";s:163:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/1453761885136965608/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=1453761885136965608&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/1453761885136965608";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/1453761885136965608";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/08/prince-proteges-month-family.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:4;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-4274532186517665153";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-08-10T08:59:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-08-10T09:46:08.933-07:00";s:5:"title";s:38:"Prince Proteges Week - Vanity 6/Vanity";s:12:"atom_content";s:4956:"<a href="http://blairmag.com/blair5/apples/">Nasty Skank Alert!</a><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/807639/bcf17220eca0b8bdad723010._AA200_.L.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/540476/bcf17220eca0b8bdad723010._AA200_.L.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>I think the people at the late, much lamented BlairMag (linked above) summed up best what was so damn appealing about a trio of barely-talented girls in their underwear, dancing slightly out of time.

A real Flying Lizards meets The Nails "88 Lines About 44 Women" vibe permeates the song, showcasing Prince's obvious love for New Wave at the time.  Bite the beat, indeed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all the coke must have gone to poor Denise/Vanity's head, because she split from the Paisley camp, turning down the female lead in <i>Purple Rain</i>, instead choosing to sign to Motown and star in <i>The Last Dragon</i>, which gave us <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/7th Heaven.mp3">this mess</a>:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ydsKrHN7_N4&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ydsKrHN7_N4&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Oooh, Vanity must'a done bumped her head.

Will your favorite purple protege be featured?  Stick around all week and see.  <br /><br />Kicking things off is Miss Escovedo, who Prince discovered in 1983 playing in her father's latin-fusion band Azteca.  The tiny terror promptly put Sheila to work, having her provide the guest vocals on his classic b-side "Erotic City" (<i>not</i> Vanity nor Apollonia, as is commonly mistaken).  A short year later, Sheila had a contract with Warner Brothers and a Top Ten hit with her debut album's title track, "The Glamorous Life".  <br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/817003/belle.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/480691/belle.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>As catchy as "The Glamorous Life" was, I, naturally, was all about the follow-up, the New Wave-ish, synth-based <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/The Belle of St. Mark.mp3">"The Belle of St. Mark"</a>.  The squiggly synth hook and balloon-popping snare accent were keepers, but the lyrics and even title of the song begged question.  The Belle of St. Mark is a frail but passionate creature, and is referred to as "he" throughout.  Then why the feminine "Belle"?  And these classic lines never fail to crack me up:<br /><br /><i>His Paris hair, it blows in the warm Parisian air <br />That blows whenever his Paris hair is there</i><br /><br />That's just gold, people.  I suppose we could blame Prince, but Sheila E. has sole writing credit on that one, so...<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/299989/sisterfate.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/926794/sisterfate.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Prince did, however, share writing credit on the first single from Sheila's follow-up LP, <i>Romance 1600</i>.  <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Sister Fate.mp3">"Sister Fate"</a> is quite reminiscent of "The Glamorous Life", just enough to be a hit, but different enough to still be enjoyable.  Alas, it was not meant to be, as "Sister Fate" died immediately upon release, putting a pall over <i>Romance 1600</i> right out of the gate.  What turned off Top 40 radio to this tune?  Was it the ahead of its time latin percussion or perhaps it was the haughty, faux-Brit spoken word section where Sheila intones:<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>There's a nasty ruMAH<br />That's going-guh rrrrrround...</i><br /><br />...before ending it in a bizarre, out-of-left-field cartoon voice.

Thanks, folks!)</i>.  Q also featured synthpop icon Jon St. James, who produced quite a few memorable tracks for other synthpoppers, including Anything Box.  After an EP, Q became SSQ, got signed to indie label Enigma Records and released their first full-length album, <i>Playback</i>.  A lucky break followed, as Enigma got a major-label distribution deal with EMI and <i>Playback's</i> first single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Synthicide.mp3">"Synthicide"</a> got a snazzy little video and some MTV play (watch Stacey's expression after each time she says the song's title in the chorus and purses her lips - hysterical!):<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qC73KoGiwFg"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qC73KoGiwFg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />...but Stacey, dear, some of us remember your oh-so-naughty, Cinemax After Dark turn on SSQ's next video for the Berlin-a-like "Screaming In My Pillow" (WARNING:  Boobies, some which may or may not be Stacey's!):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5npJ03IGcs">See it here</a>, since embedding has been disabled...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/66495/staceyq.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/658522/staceyq.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><i>Playback</i> didn't set the charts on fire, though, and Stacey and the boys soon found themselves without a major label deal.  It was back to the drawing board where someone along the line made the smart decision to cut out the middle men and put Stacey right up front.  Soon, Atlantic Records came calling and released SSQ's second, er, Stacey Q's <i>debut</i> album, <i>Better Than Heaven</i>.  In all fairness, while the SSQ personnel remained the same, the sound did change quite a bit, becoming much more pop-oriented, with the soft-core porn lyrics muted...at first glance.  The make-over resulted in "Two of Hearts", a Top 3 smash that everyone knows.<br /><br />And hey, you probably know the follow-up single <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/We Connect.mp3">"We Connect"</a>, too, since it was, I don't know, THE SAME FRIGGIN' SONG!  "We Connect" was always a source of laughs for me and my friends due to its "Two of Hearts" Xerox nature - we'd sing the lyrics to "Two of Hearts" over "We Connect" and of course, they fit perfectly.

In fact, "Forever Young's" review on <a href="http://allmusic.com">AllMusic.com</a> says, "'Forever Young,' a stark, epic song that would become essential for every post-1984 high school graduation..." blah blah, etc., etc.<br /><br />I'm calling bullshit on this urban myth.<br /><br /><b>No one</b> in the 80s had Alphaville's "Forever Young" as their prom theme.  Rod Stewart's, maybe, but not Alphaville.  Can anyone prove to me their high school prom theme was Alphaville's "Forever Young?"  I'll need supporting documentation.  Maybe it's the Midwest in me, but no one knew who the hell Alphaville were in 1984, besides the super-hip artfags and new wavers that were populating schools nationwide in groups of four or five.  I think a lot of music critics have a slightly skewed retroactive memory as it relates to "Forever Young's" impact.  Maybe you West Coasters had some big Alphaville movement happening at the time.  I'd love to be proven wrong here, so scan those prom programs!<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/73668/31_2.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/243586/31_2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Moving on, "Forever Young" was <i>Forever Young's</i> second single, following the middling chart non-success of "Big In Japan".  Both songs are now synthpop classics, but I always had a special place in my heart for the album's closer and third single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/The Jet Set.mp3">"Jet Set"</a>, a ridiculously over the top spectacle matched only by its even campier video.  With its drag queens, hyperactive choreography and questionable dance moves, the video seemed to take its visual cues from one of my all-time favorite piece of poop movies, <a href="http://www.fast-rewind.com/theapple.htm">The Apple</a>:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/exjEPOby3-A&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/exjEPOby3-A&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/605239/Alphaville---Dance-with-me.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/264450/Alphaville---Dance-with-me.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Alas, "Jet Set" did nada and Alphaville moved on to album #2, "Afternoons In Utopia" and its lead-off single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Dance With Me.mp3">"Dance with Me"</a>.  A zippy little number, "Dance With Me" did okay on the Dance Charts but didn't crossover like it should have.

The aggro-industrial-metal revolving-member combo led by Alain Jourgensen, mostly known for their mid-90s alterna-crossover hit "Jesus Built My Hotrod," yes?  But are you aware that Ministry had much milder origins, starting as a New Wave dance club synthpop duo?  And that <i>With Sympathy</i>, the duo's first album, is still my favorite (and yes, I also adore everything else up through and including <i>Psalm 69</i>).  <i>Sympathy</i>'s first half is a fairly solid synthpop collection, much in the Soft Cell vein, complete with Chicagoan Jourgensen singing in a snotty British accent and even, GASP, rapping at one point on the single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/I Wanted To Tell Her.mp3">"I Wanted To Tell Her"</a>.  "I Wanted To Tell Her", along with "Work For Love" were respectable club hits, and who was around early MTV that doesn't remember the video for "Revenge"?<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OU7N10Y6nac"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OU7N10Y6nac" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />And golly, through the magic that is YouTube, how about a live version of such from 1983?  Yowza!<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jBU_mmyYAGE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jBU_mmyYAGE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />...but a personal favorite was the last song on the album, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/She's Got A Cause.mp3">"She's Got A Cause"</a>, with its off-beat snare and extra snotty vocal delivery ("SHE'S.  GAUGHT.  A CAWWWZE!").  It's like Marc Almond, but straight.  <br /><br />Now, of course, Alain disowns this album, to the point of letting it lapse out of print for quite a few years now.  He claims his record label at the time, Arista, pushed this poppier sound down his throat, but I do have to take issue with that - I certainly wasn't there, but songs like "Cold Life" and "(Everyday Is) Halloween" were done before AND after Arista came into the picture.  Besides, can a record company actually <i>force</i> you to write a song?  Certainly they can pick and choose compositions you don't prefer, but I've yet to see Joe A&R Guy worm his way into someone's brain, take control of their fingers and hit the DX7 keys for you.  <br /><br />Whatever the issue was, Ministry went on to discover guitars, machine-gun drum loops and lots and lots of drugs.  But I don't understand the hatred for this album, a nice little time capsule of perfectly acceptable synthpop that deserves a nice remastering and re-release.  Maybe now that Al's clean (since 2003!), he can look back on his misspent youth with a little more understanding and lift the embargo.<br /><br /><i>"I Wanted To Tell Her" peaked at #13 on the Billboard Club Play Singles Chart and at #106 on the Bubbling Under Chart in 1983.</i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=ministry&tag=lostinthe8005-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> has a nice selection of Ministry, including "Early Trax", which compiles some early work from this period.

Judd puttered about New Zealand with a punk band called Suburban Reptiles until they broke up.  Taking the Reptiles' bassist and drummer, the trio became Swingers and in 1980 recorded their first single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/One Good Reason.mp3">"One Good Reason"</a>.  Now, before you read any further, take a listen to "One Good Reason".  G'head.  Trust me here.<br /><br />Is there a big goofy grin on <i>your</i> face now, too?  How great is that song?  Sorry I'm all gushy, but that's truly one of the great lost singles of the '80s, crammed with hooks, humor, angular guitars, falsetto backing vox, just a tidy little encapsulation of what New Wave was all about in under three minutes.  <br /><br />"One Good Reason" cracked the New Zealand Top 40, but didn't do much anywhere else.  That would change with Swingers' next single, the equally infectious <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Counting The Beat.mp3">"Counting The Beat"</a>.  "Beat" took off like a rocket, hitting number one in Australia and helping the band get a gig in the movie "Starstruck", which apparently is some sort of cult hit, though I've never seen it.  Here's a clip from the flick of Swingers performing "One Good Reason" - pay attention to the jerky, quirky New Wave choreography:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RN8qmILWiU0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RN8qmILWiU0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />And while we're at it, here's the video for "Counting the Beat" that got a bit of MTV play in '82:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fQ8GBTANBk8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fQ8GBTANBk8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />An American compilation called "Counting the Beat" was released that same year - it consisted of Swingers' sole LP, "Practical Jokers" with "One Good Reason" added.  Unfortunately, the band was unable to translate their Australian/NZ success to these shores, or replicate it down under, either, so they split up soon after.  Judd went on to score movies and record solo works, while bass player Dwayne "Bones" Hillman joined a little band called Midnight Oil that made a fair amount of noise.<br /><br />What they left was a decent album with two fantastic singles that sound as immediate and fresh today as they did in '80 and '82.  Some smart hipster band with asymmetrical haircuts and a Misshapes pedigree could totally rip them off and hit big today.  Please credit Lost in the '80s when doing so, thanks.<br /><br /><i>"One Good Reason" did not chart.<br />"Counting The Beat" peaked #45 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart in 1982.</i><br /><br />"Counting The Beat" was reissued on CD in 1997, but is a bit pricey on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=swingers&tag=lostinthe8005-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />...you can find it much cheaper on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>.";s:12:"link_replies";s:163:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/8701128368623000486/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=8701128368623000486&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/8701128368623000486";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/8701128368623000486";s:4:"link";s:83:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/oh-yes-i-will-oh-no-you-wont-oh-yes-i.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:12;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-7209925386042748417";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-06-22T13:28:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-06-22T13:30:28.006-07:00";s:5:"title";s:64:""what if i forget / and reach for you / will i dream about you?"";s:12:"atom_content";s:4114:"Pop's road is littered with the remains of artists who unsuccessfully attempted the transition from "quirky" and "fun" to "mature" - Toni Basil, Altered Images, and sadly, one of the most talented performers of the '80s, Cyndi Lauper.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/383669/SME_0101_EK_044318.70Q_200x200_72dpi_RGB.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/339582/SME_0101_EK_044318.70Q_200x200_72dpi_RGB.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>After two huge albums, a hefty number of Top Ten singles, and countless videos co-starring her manager/boyfriend, her mom and wrestling manager Captain Lou Albano, Lauper tried to jettison most of her image idiosyncrasies with her third album, <i>A Night To Remember</i>.  Gone were the Rock &amp; Wrestling connection, the extreme wardrobe and vocal hiccups and yelps, replaced by a sleek, almost 1940's movie queen look and a more traditional, straight-ahead vocal approach that did not suffer any loss in quality.<br /><br />And it worked - at first.  <i>Night's</i> first single, the Steinberg/Kelly composition "I Drove All Night" hit the Top Ten, complete with a stylish video showcasing the new, streamlined Lauper.  So, it seemed the follow-up, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/My%20First%20Night%20Without%20You.mp3">"My First Night Without You"</a> would be a slam-dunk to continue the streak, seeing as it was also written by Steinberg/Kelly (along with Lauper).  It was even melodically familiar, ripping off the beginning of Bruce Springsteen's "Fire" (made famous by the Pointer Sisters) and even recalling "I Drove" in places.  But, for whatever reason, "My First Night" stalled in the low 60s, a chart derailing from which Lauper would never recover.<br /><br />Is that fair?  Take another listen to "My First Night"...it's a heartrending affair, dancing dangerously close to the shmaltz line until you get to the middle eight and the lines:<br /><br /><i>Will I be able to sleep?<br />Will I lie in my bed and weep?<br />What if i forget<br />And reach for you<br />Will i dream about you?</i><br /><br />It's a genius lyric that has the protagonist in total dread that the relationship is truly over and then there's the brutal realization that the bed is going to be a lot colder and emptier for the first time in memory.  Excuse me, I need a tissue.  No, I'm fine, it's just my contacts.

As distinctly American as this sound was, the Cats had to go overseas to the U.K. to get noticed, then broke thru in the States a couple of years later.  This little sub-genre had a few more players, including the Polecats and my favorite, Roman Holliday (two L's, please).<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/895310/romanholliday101871.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/65966/romanholliday101871.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Roman Holliday set themselves apart from the rest of the rockabilly revivalists by incorporating more swing elements in their music, complete with a horn section, a move later adopted by the Stray Cats' Brian Setzer who would make a boatload of cash.

After the huge success of <i>Heartbeat City</i> and some lesser success with various solo outlets, the band regrouped to work on a new album.  Judging from the results, one could assume the band was torn between going back to basics or just throwing in the towel to give the people what they wanted, or assumed, from a Cars album.  <i>Door To Door</i> is a strange beast - the first single, "You Are The Girl", was a shameless rewrite of "Tonight She Comes", a big hit from the Greatest Hits album that had some out a year prior, just slowed down a tad with some new lyrics slapped on.  Not exactly a creative pinnacle.  <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/940157/strapmein.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/320/989273/strapmein.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>In a complete turnaround, the second single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Strap Me In.mp3">"Strap Me In"</a>, was a breath of fresh air, as the group shook off all the slick Mutt Lange/Roy Thomas Baker sheen they'd been shellacked in for years and delivered one of their rawer, rockier tracks, reminiscent of the <i>Panorama</i> era.  The lyrical theme has changed somewhat - instead of Ric Wanting What He Can't Have, we now have songs about not only having it, but possibly regretting it, or settling in for the ride.  Naturally, something as less slick and intriguing as "Strap Me In" tanked.  After all, who wants to hear someone complain about being married to a supermodel?<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XC-0JM78Y3A&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XC-0JM78Y3A&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/144249/214031.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/320/395255/214031.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Elektra wasn't about to give up on one of their biggest cash cows, however, picking the most Soft Rock/Adult Contemporary song in the entire Cars oveure as <i>Door</i>'s third single.  <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Coming Up You.mp3">"Coming Up You"</a> is almost sickly sweet, full of tinkly keyboards, shmoopy lyrics and, since he sang on their biggest ballad "Drive", Ben Orr vocals.  Having said all that, I actually kinda like it and feel it should have been a much bigger hit than its paltry chart ranking reflects.  I'm sure Elektra felt the same way. <br /><br />But contrast it with "Strap Me In" or the album's <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Door To Door.mp3">title track</a>, which is absolutely the thrashiest, punkiest song The Cars ever put to vinyl, and it's obvious Ric was having a serious identity crisis.  Which Cars did he want to give us?  The new, super-shiny plastic pop hits Cars or the New Wave/Suicide-influenced Cars of old?  And what direction could The Cars go next?<br /><br />Sadly, we'll never know.  The Cars broke up just as "Coming Up You" was struggling up the charts, creating sort of a nice bookend for the New Wave era of the '80s.<br /><br /><i>"Strap Me In" peaked at #85 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #4 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks Charts in 1987.<br />"Coming Up You" peaked at #74 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988.<br />"Door To Door" was not a single.</i>";s:12:"link_replies";s:163:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/7497157961735250208/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=7497157961735250208&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/7497157961735250208";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/7497157961735250208";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/lost-cars-month-cars-door-to-door.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:15;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-2573744809054704608";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-06-01T19:33:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-06-01T19:35:13.939-07:00";s:5:"title";s:38:"Lost Cars Week - Benjamin Orr The Lace";s:12:"atom_content";s:2940:"So of all the Cars solo projects (I haven't forgotten Greg Hawkes' 1983 effort - but it's mostly instrumental), whose do you think was the most successful?  You'd think the main vocalist and songwriter, Ric Ocasek's, right?<br /><br />Wellllll...yeah.  While Ric's first stab at non-Cars success stumbled out of the gate, his second solo release, 1986's <i>This Side of Paradise</i> scored a #15 hit with "Emotion In Motion".  But that same year, Benjamin Orr, Cars bassist and <i>other</i> vocalist (he sang "Drive" and "Just What I Needed" among others, 'membz?) released his first solo album, <i>The Lace</i>, and scored a sizeable ballad-y hit of his own with "Stay The Night".<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/313924/B000G1R4P2.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V63910879_.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/136629/B000G1R4P2.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V63910879_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Surprisingly, <i>The Lace</i> isn't half bad - it's very much a product of its time, a showcase of mid-80s radio-friendly rock in the vein of your Mister Misters, et al.  I'm a particular fan of the second single, the very Cars-like <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Too Hot To Stop.mp3">"Too Hot To Stop"</a>, complete with appearances in the video from Hawkes and Cars drummer David Robinson.  While not in the video, Cars guitarist Elliot Easton played on the album.

But hey, plenty of hot chicks with extremely feathered hair in flowing robes!  And Ben's "dancing" shows why The Cars tended to stand still in place during live shows.  Yikes.<br /><br />Sadly, Orr died of pancreatic cancer in late 2000, effectively ending any chance for a full-fledged Cars reunion.  But the band did come together once more after this solo effort to record their final album...which we'll look at next time.<br /><br /><i>"Too Hot To Stop" peaked at #25 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart in 1987.</i><br /><br /><i><b>The Lace</i> has recently been re-released - you can pick it up at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Benjamin%20Orr&tag=lostinthe8005-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</b>";s:12:"link_replies";s:163:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/2573744809054704608/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=2573744809054704608&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/2573744809054704608";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/2573744809054704608";s:4:"link";s:78:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/lost-cars-week-benjamin-orr-lace.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:16;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-8322854931390028178";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-05-25T19:52:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-05-25T19:53:59.297-07:00";s:5:"title";s:48:"Lost Cars Month - Elliot Easton Change No Change";s:12:"atom_content";s:3631:"So, we've established that between writing every single Cars song (with rare exceptions of collaborations with keyboardist Greg Hawkes) and releasing a solo album that Ric Ocasek was very much the creative force behind the band.  So who exactly was clamoring for solo projects from the other members?<br /><br />Whether the public wanted them or not, every non-Ric Cars member with the exception of drummer David Robinson put out a solo disc in the 80s.  And why not?  The band had built up plenty of exposure and goodwill by 1985, with <i>Heartbeat City</i> putting them firmly at the top of the charts and on radio with five Top 40 singles from that album alone (hats off to them for getting a song as moody and dark as "Why Can't I Have You" in the Top 40 - talk about momentum).  And they had to feel creatively stifled with Ocasek calling all the shots.  So if opportunity presents itself, grab it, I suppose.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/689436/change.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/63240/change.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>And if you get the chance to work with a songwriter like <a href="http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2005/12/this-christmas-shower-me-with-jules.html">Jules Shear</a>, dear God, you <i>better</i> grab it, especially if your only previous claim to fame was squiggly, brilliant guitar solos like Elliot Easton's.  Easton teamed with Shear to write 1985's, <i>Change No Change</i>, and it was a mixed bag of barely there song sketches and momentary power pop brilliance.  <i>Por ejemplo...</i><br /><br />First single <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/(Wearing Down) Like A Wheel.mp3">"(Wearing Down) Like A Wheel"</a> starts off promisingly enough, but then someone forgot to put a chorus in there.  Whoopsie.  Not the best foot to put forward to get people interested in your album.<br /><br />Especially when you have much superior songs like <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Shayla.mp3">"Shayla"</a> hanging around.

For every crowning achievement like "Since You're Gone" or "Cruiser", there were kiss-ass concessions to Top 40 radio (title track, anyone?) and just plain filler ("Maybe Baby").  Be honest - when was the last time you put this CD on?  Do you even <b>own</b> it on CD?  However, with the success of the title track, The Cars were back on the hit racetrack.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/953749/beatitude.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/347393/beatitude.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Which made the brave, experimental nature of Ric Ocasek's first solo album, 1982's <i>Beatitude</i> all the more surprising.  Since he wrote all The Cars' songs, it would have been quite easy for Ocasek to keep in that creative vein, crank out a few more radio-friendly hits and bank all the proceeds for himself.  Thankfully, this was not the path trodden.<br /><br />Wellllll, except for that lead-off single.  Alright, you got me.  <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Something To Grab For.mp3">"Something to Grab For"</a> is basically Cars-by-numbers (yes, Ric wants again wants something he can't have!), save for the stop/start beat of the chorus, vaguely reminiscent of <i>Panorama's</i> "Touch & Go".  Unfortunately, it fared just about as well on the charts as that ill-fated single, despite a moody video played to death by MTV.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ml9ZB98EfzY&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ml9ZB98EfzY&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Two more singles were released to try to shore up the project - "Jimmy Jimmy" was a departure, since it focused on someone other than the narrator (!), in this case the boredom of disaffected Reagan-era teens, with the line "Nobody's gettin' off" summing it all up.  The electro-pulse of the track is quite different than the Cars sound, emphasizing the dancier aspects of the song.  <br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tPaL3P8kffE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tPaL3P8kffE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />The third single, "Prove" sank without a trace, save for some dance chart action, but don't feel too badly.

But the solo thing appealed to other band members, too...as we'll see tomorrow.<br /><br /><i>"Something To Grab For" peaked at #47 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart in 1983.<br />"Jimmy Jimmy" peaked at #25 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and at #60 on the Club Play Chart in the same year.</i><br /><br /><b><i>Beatitude</i> is out of print, but you can find used copies on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=ric%20ocasek&tag=lostinthe8005-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and other Ric Ocasek tunes on </b><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=pgCWrmzny1o&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewArtist%253Fid%253D1159915%2526partnerId%253D30"><br />  <img height="15" width="61" alt="Ric Ocasek" src="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif"></img><br /></a>";s:12:"link_replies";s:161:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/569915185358499839/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=569915185358499839&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/569915185358499839";s:9:"link_self";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/569915185358499839";s:4:"link";s:81:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/05/lost-cars-week-ric-ocasek-beatitude.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:18;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-7780596289471890497";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-05-11T17:53:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-05-11T17:58:25.229-07:00";s:5:"title";s:26:"Lost Cars Month - Panorama";s:12:"atom_content";s:4231:"While <a href="http://www.thenewcars.com/thenewcars/intro.htm">this</a> shambles its way across the country, embarrassing itself in half-empty sheds nationwide (as Molly Shannon's Marcy Darcy would say, "Don't <i>even</i> get me started!"), what better time to devote a week to the <b>real</b> Cars, the New Wave darlings who didn't necessarily want to be New Wave.  This week, we'll focus on the band's lost gems, alongside some lost solo projects along the way.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/1600/302819/200px-The_Cars_-_Panorama.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4435/164/400/999836/200px-The_Cars_-_Panorama.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Why not begin with my favorite Cars album, <i>Panorama</i>?  The Cars' third album was their most challenging, mostly jettisoning the band's trademark happy skip/shuffle Crickets bounce and peppy melodies for a darker, more aggressive tone.  Gone were the handclaps and shiny background singalongs, replaced by David Robinson's increasingly synth-aided drums (by <i>Heartbeat City</i> he'd be drummer in name only) and Greg Hawkes' menacing keyboards while Elliot Easton's always-innovative guitar solos and Ric Ocasek's Iggy Pop meets Buddy Holly vocal theatrics stayed pretty much the same, with a few minor tweaks.<br /><br />Ocasek's lyrics for the Cars can mostly be pared down to a one sentence logline - Ric wants something he can't have, whether it's affection, a girl, acceptance, etc.  I mean, just look at some of the opening lines on most of the songs on <i>Panorama</i>:<br /><br /><i>I'm gonna get what's comin' to me<br />All I need is what you got<br />I wanna shake like Liguardia<br />It's my party, you can come</i>(well, consider the song's title, "Don't Tell Me No")<br /><i>Do you have to be so hard to get?</i><br /><br />Ric definitely stuck to a theme with the Cars - that would change after this album.  But we're getting ahead of ourselves...<br /><br /><i>Panorama's</i> first single, "Touch & Go" was a perfect summation of this theme, but its start/stop faux reggae beat prevented it from reaching any higher on the charts than a puny #37.  Two follow-up singles, "Don't Tell Me No" and "Gimmie Some Slack" failed to chart.  But the album's true teasures are its bookends, the fantastic opening <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Panorama.mp3">title track</a> and the album's closer, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Up And Down.mp3">"Up And Down"</a>.  <br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yA5s7D7ffYk&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yA5s7D7ffYk&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />"Up And Down" is one of those shoulda-been tracks that had the potential to be an AOR monster, alongside "Moving In Stereo" and "Bye Bye Love".  But alas, it was not meant to be, as <i>Panorama</i> eventually faltered, leaving the Cars shaken up (har), wondering what the next move would be.<br /><br />But first, Ocasek had a few things to get off his chest.

While Young had a fairly high profile at the beginning of his career in the UK, thanks to his association with his second band, The Q-Tips, he had a tougher road making waves in the States.  His first US single, the Marvin Gaye remake <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home).mp3">"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)"</a>, sputtered upon release, just breaking into the lower depths of the Hot 100 (it fared considerably better in the UK, hitting #1).  <br /><br />Ah, but the follow-up, "Come Back and Stay" fared considerably better, breaking into the Top 40 and establishing a Young foothold in the US.  The song is a classic, but it's really about two things - the fretless bassline and the weird, Tourette's-ish backing vocals of Young's back-up singers, The Fabulously Wealthy Tarts.  Paul's nearly a footnote in his own song.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/1600/paulyoung_loveofthecommonpeople_coollp.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/400/paulyoung_loveofthecommonpeople_coollp.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />A similar issue cropped up on <i>No Parlez</i>'s third Stateside single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Love Of The Common People.mp3">"Love Of The Common People"</a>, a song made famous here by a few country artists, including Lynn Anderson and Waylon Jennings.  You've got the Tarts yelping "Ah ay yiiii yiii!", sleigh bells, vibes and oh yeah, Paul singing.  Best part - in the second verse when Paul sings: <br /><br /><i>It's a good thing you don't have bus fare<br />it could fall thru a hole in your pocket <br />and you lose it in the snow on the ground</i><br /><br />...the Tarts robotically intone "a good thinnnng...OUCH" in the background.  Wha, huh, wha?  The <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Love Of The Common People (Extended Club Mix).mp3">12" mix</a> is even crazier.  (And since this is now officially the season for giving, here's the rare 12" mix of <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/Come Back And Stay (Extended Club Mix).mp3">"Come Back And Stay"</a> that was on the B-side.)  <i>No Parlez</i> also featured a blue-eyed soul version of Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" which isn't nearly as vomit-worthy as it sounds like it would be.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9vxzmgEkobY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9vxzmgEkobY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />"Common People" fizzled out in the low 50s of the charts, and <i>No Parlez</i> soon followed.

Evocative of Depeche Mode with a bit of Heaven 17 while sounding somewhat unique, thanks to some real piano, "...Heaven" is a deceptively simple song that reveals its complexity with repeated listens.  For example, it sure seems like a love song, until you dig deeper:<br /><br /><i>See how we planned for saddened eyes<br />And tears to pave the way<br />I fought the fever as I knew<br />My hair it turned to grey<br /><br />Study your face and fade the frame<br />Too close for comfort now<br />We can recall the harmony<br />That lingered but turned sour<br /><br />Feels like heaven</i><br /><br />...and you realize this dude is ecstatic because he's finally leaving a drama queen bee-yotch that he can barely stand to be near.

Their debut, "Throw The Warped Wheel Out", is still in print however, albeit as an import, and that's pretty darn impressive for an album released in 1984 that never charted.  <br /><br />And am I the only one who sort of hears "Feels Like Heaven" every time I hear follow one-hit wonders When In Rome's "The Promise"?

You probably heard the story about its first single, Top 5 hit "Stand Back" - <i>"that's Prince playing keyboards!"</i>  Well, not really.  Prince reportedly played on the demo version of the song and gets a co-writing credit, but keyboardist Sandy Stewart actually did the synth duties on the finished product.  And the video is significant because it was the only time Stevie ever used a treadmill:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/r3pP2PhFt0U"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/r3pP2PhFt0U" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />Yes, Lost in the '80s - home of the cheap shot.<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/1600/IfAnyoneFalls45.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/320/IfAnyoneFalls45.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Stewart also co-wrote "The Wild Heart's" second single, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/If Anyone Falls.mp3">"If Anyone Falls"</a>, which was even <b>more</b> synth-drenched.  "If Anyone Falls" is a pleasant enough tune, but those opening lyrics still crack me up:<br /><br /><i>"I hear a voice in the room next to mine<br />Feels good, sounds good<br />Closes the door from behind<br />And another voice comes thru the door"</i><br /><br />...then she goes on to talk about her lover.  Um, who were the other two people in the room next to hers?  Her lover and a mistress?  And the voice closes the door?  Impressive.  Huh?

Ever hear the urban legend about the origin of the Stevie Nicks Booty Bump?  It's really not worksafe.  Let's just say it involves snorting coke without using your nose, but with a straw and another orifice.  If you'd like me to share further, ask me in the comments.  But anyhooze, the point being is that Miz Nicks was getting progressively more and more snowblind, so outside writers were brought in, more synths were stacked up and the result was "Rock a Little".  Love the title - rock a <i>little</i>, not a whole lot, 'k?<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/1600/ICantWait45.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/320/ICantWait45.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />First single "Talk To Me" was pretty typical Nicks fare and resulted in another big Top 5 hit.  The follow-up, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/I Can't Wait.mp3">"I Can't Wait"</a> is quite interesting, though.  Take a listen and forget it's by Stevie Nicks for a sec - get to about the thirty second mark and tell me that doesn't sound exactly like New Order at the time.  The synth-bass, the sampled orchestral stings...a definite influence, and not one people would immediately associate with the Welsh Witch.  <br /><br />And as for the video, I have two words for you:  Stairs Choreography!<br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/owBAG68urvs"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/owBAG68urvs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />After a rocky "Rock A Little" tour, marred by the ravages of coke on Nicks' voice and figure, Stevie retreated for a bit to rejoin the Mac for a couple more albums, with two disjointed and relatively ignored solo albums before finally cleaning up her act and joining the classic Mac line-up for the huge "The Dance" comeback album and tour.  Since then, Stevie continues to work with Fleetwood Mac while putting out solo work in the downtime.  And Nicks hasn't left the New Wave/Dance influences entirely behind her, as her #1 Dance Club Hit from 2001, "Planets of the Universe" can attest.<br /><br />Oh, and uh, <a href="http://www.catanna.com/steviesfans.htm">wow.</a><br /><br /><i>"If Anyone Falls" peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983.<br />"I Can't Wait" peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1986.</i><br /><br />Get Stevie Nicks music at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=stevie%20nicks&tag=lostinthe8005-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lostinthe8005-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> or on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=pgCWrmzny1o&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewArtist%253Fid%253D147875%2526partnerId%253D30"><br />  <img height="15" width="61" alt="Stevie Nicks" src="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif"></img><br /></a>";s:12:"link_replies";s:163:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/feeds/2384009435171914553/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10804919&postID=2384009435171914553&isPopup=true";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/2384009435171914553";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10804919/posts/default/2384009435171914553";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://lostinthe80s.blogspot.com/2009/04/when-new-wave-happens-to-old-artists_13.html";s:11:"author_name";s:4:"John";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13106035008839197229";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:23;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10804919.post-5994864401963884959";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-04-06T18:00:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-04-06T18:04:57.536-07:00";s:5:"title";s:57:"When New Wave Happens To Old Artists - Lindsey Buckingham";s:12:"atom_content";s:4054:"An alarm clock rings starting from the right speaker, crossing over to the left, then back and forth.

Drummer/singer Jimmy Marinos handled the vocal duties, belting out a rave-up that had its finger on the pulse of guitar-based New Wave of the time.  Unfortunately, the song stalled at #49 and was never heard again.<br /><br />You wish.  Unless you're in a frat or a sorority.<br /><br />So yeah, you know the deal - song flops upon initial release only to find new life years later via commercials and licensing blah blah.  <br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/1600/in-heat-front.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4435/164/400/in-heat-front.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />However, The Romantics had another big (actual charted) hit with their fourth(!) album, "In Heat".  The vocal duties for the Top 3 hit "Talking In Your Sleep" were handled by guitarist/singer Wally Palmar, no big deal, right?  I mean, a band with a drummer as a frontman never gets very far (shut up, Genesis fans.  I'm looking at you, Jellyfish!).  The problem is that dear Wally had a bit of a - how to put this politely? - faggy lisp (I'm allowed to say that).  So, the chorus ended up sounding like:<br /><br /><i>I hear the thecreths that you keep<br />When you're talkin' in your thleep</i><br /><br />Why not just let Jimmy sing everything?  What's that?  You kicked him out of the band?  Oh, dear.  <br /><br />That's right, management squabbles led to Jimmy's exit from the band shortly after "In Heat's" breakthrough to the charts.  Nothing ruins a band like success, no?  Luckily, The Romanticths had already filmed the video for "Talking In Your Thleep's" follow-up thingle, <a href="http://www.smoothcopy.com/audio/One in a Million.mp3">"One In A Million"</a>.  While not setting the charts on fire like the first single, "Million" is a great little pop tune, the kind you really don't hear anymore.  And what's that in the instrumental break?  A xylophone solo?  Nah, steel drums.
