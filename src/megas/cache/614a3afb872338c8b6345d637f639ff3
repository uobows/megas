Your posts so often resonate deeply with me. I will be celebrating my 60th birthday this week and have been pushing the &quot;jump while you can&quot; envelope for years. I love to cliff jump, ride horseback and have recently begun rock scrambling with a goal to begin canyoneering. 
I went back to school when my kids reached school age and have been enjoying a wonderful profession as a Physician Assistant ever since.  Watching me go through college I believe spurred my kids to succeed in their education, 2 of my 3 sons were valedictorians. The third went on to become a Green Beret. 
My biggest leap came at 50 when I decided it was time to give back to my country and joined the National Guard.  As a grandmother I deployed to Iraq as the medical provider for over 1000 combat engineers. 
My goal as soon as I retire is to bike off-road across the US on the Trans America Trail to fully appreciate this wonderful country of ours and the people in it. We are so blessed in this country! Some of my friends think I&#039;m a little crazy but I want to fully embrace this life that the Lord has granted me!  Thanks for the encouragement!";s:7:"summary";s:1162:"Thank you Joshua!
