I would like to apologize for the frustration you encountered while trying to sign up for Summer classes. I have resolved two issues which were causing the Buy Now button to redirect you to the home page of the website. I am also working on a way to make adding multiple Summer camps to your checkout cart a quicker process.

Thank you for contacting us and we hope to see you back soon!";s:7:"summary";s:401:"Rhonda Tutt,
