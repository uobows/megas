Then the wait began. At 12:12  UTC, the AMSAT Engineering team, watching ZR6AIC's WebSDR waterfall, saw the  characteristic "Fox Tail" of the Fox-1 series FM transmitter, confirming that  the satellite was<br />alive and transmitting over South Africa. Shortly after  12:34 UTC, the first telemetry was received and uploaded to AMSAT servers by  Maurizio Balducci, IV3RYQ, in Cervignano del Friuli, Italy. Initial  telemetry confirmed that the satellite was healthy.<br /><br />After confirmation  of signal reception, OSCAR Number Administrator Bill Tynan, W3XO, sent an  email to the AMSAT Board of Directors designating the satellite AMSAT-OSCAR  91 (AO-91). Bill's email stated:<br /><br />"RadFxSat (Fox-1B) was launched  successfully at 09:47 UTC today November 18, 2017 from Vandenberg Air Force  Base in California and has been received by several amateur  stations.<br /><br />RadFxSat (Fox-1B), a 1U CubeSat, is a joint mission of AMSAT  and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics at Vanderbilt  University. The Vanderbilt package is intended to measure the&nbsp; effects of  radiation on electronic components, including demonstration of an  on-orbit platform for space qualification of components as well as to  validate and improve computer models for predicting radiation tolerance of  semiconductors.<br /><br />AMSAT constructed the remainder of the satellite  including the spaceframe, on-board computer and power system. The amateur  radio package is similar to that currently on orbit on AO-85 with an  uplink on 435.250 MHz (67.0 Hz CTCSS) and a downlink on 145.960  MHz. Experiment telemetry will be downlinked via the DUV  subaudible telemetry stream, which can be decoded using the FoxTelem  software.<br /><br />RadFxSat (Fox-1B) was sent aloft as a secondary payload on the  United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta II rocket that transported the  JPSS-1 satellite to orbit. RadFxSat (Fox-1B) is one of five CubeSats  making up this NASA Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) XIV  mission, riding as secondary payloads aboard the JPSS-1 mission.<br /><br />Since  RadFxSat (Fox-1B) has met all of the qualifications necessary to receive an  OSCAR number, I, by the authority vested in me by the AMSAT President, do  hereby confer on this satellite the designation AMSAT-OSCAR 91 or AO-91. I  join amateur radio operators in the U.S. and around the world in wishing  AO-91 a long and successful life in both its amateur and scientific  missions.<br /><br />I, along with the rest of the amateur community, congratulate  all of the volunteers who worked so diligently to construct, test and  prepare for launch the newest amateur radio satellite.<br /><br />William A.

The launch now is scheduled for no earlier than Tuesday, November  14. RadFxSat is one of four CubeSats making up the NASA ELaNa XIV mission,  riding as secondary payloads aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)-1  mission, which will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base,  California.<br /><br />RadFxSat is a partnership with Vanderbilt University's  Institute for Space and Defense Electronics (ISDE) and hosts four payloads  for the study of radiation effects on commercial off-the-shelf  components. It will carry a Fox-1 style FM U/V repeater with an uplink  on 435.250 MHz (67.0 Hz CTCSS) and a downlink on 145.960 MHz.  Satellite and experiment telemetry will be downlinked via the DUV  subaudible telemetry stream, which can be decoded using FoxTelem  software<br />available from, <a href="https://www.amsat.org/foxtelem-software-for-windows-mac-linux/">https://www.amsat.org/foxtelem-software-for-windows-mac-linux/</a>  .<br /><br />AMSAT Vice-President Engineering, Jerry Buxton, N0JY,  said RadFxSat/Fox-1B will automatically come up in beacon  mode, transmitting a beacon and voice ID ("RadFxSat Safe Mode") every  2<br />minutes, starting about 50 minutes after deployment. He said  AMSATcommand stations will want to see voltage and current data  to determine that the spacecraft is healthy and to conduct various tests  before opening it up for general use.<br /><br />Telemetry should begin about 55  minutes after deployment. "[F]or the next 72-96 hours at least, as we look  for successful startup, watch the general health and function as the  satellite begins to acclimate to space, and perform the on orbit checkout,"  Buxton said. Ground stations are invited to continue uploading received  telemetry for the life of the satellite.<br /><br />Those using FoxTelem to  capture telemetry are asked to check "Upload to Server" in the software's  settings and make sure that ground station parameters are provided. "You can  help AMSAT and everyone waiting to get on the air with RadFxSat tremendously,  by capturing RadFxSat telemetry," Buxton said.<br /><br />In the initial beacon  mode, the transmitter is limited to 10 seconds "on" time, followed by a  2-minute "off" cycle. "If we are seeing good data from user telemetry data,  it is likely when it comes over<br />the US for the first good pass, we will  command it from beacon mode to normal safe mode, which then puts RadFxSat in  full, but still safe mode, operation and transmits a full two frames of&nbsp; telemetry," Buxton said.<br /><br />Buxton called on the satellite community to  be "polite and patient" as RadFxSat is commissioned.<br /><br />"The on-orbit  check-out procedure is similar to Fox-1A/AO-85 and could be completed in as  little as a few days, if we have the cooperation of the users," he said. "It  is very important - not to mention just plain good amateur operating practice  - to refrain from using the transponder uplink, so we can do the on-orbit  tests, including when we turn on transponder mode for testing. I  can't stress enough, the importance of this cooperation, not just for  us but for all users, simply having a little patience so we can  conduct the tests as quickly and accurately as possible."<br /><br />Buxton said  AMSAT would "make it broadly known" when the transponder is available for  general use. "If you hear someone on the transponder, please don't assume  that it is open for general use,"<br />he said. "Check the AMSAT website,  Facebook, Twitter, to be sure you're not accidentally jumping in and  unwittingly interfering with the commissioning process."<br />NNNN<br />/EX<br /><b></b><i></i><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strike></strike>";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28874080/posts/default/1143428615382529912";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28874080/posts/default/1143428615382529912";s:4:"link";s:82:"http://monitor-post.blogspot.com/2017/11/radfxsat-fox-1b-launch-delayed-amsat.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Larry";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:4;a:10:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28874080.post-3761516500910543856";s:9:"published";s:29:"2017-11-05T09:50:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2017-11-05T09:50:22.328-05:00";s:5:"title";s:46:"Product Announcement - DXtreme Monitor Log 11?";s:12:"atom_content";s:8477:"DXtreme Software? has released a new version of its popular logging program for radio monitoring enthusiasts: <b>DXtreme Monitor Log 11</b>.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfsV-4oWZZI/Wf8j5WvuPxI/AAAAAAAAJCg/MhwO84Wf5Nowk4xXEOXYetYpt7qr54G5wCLcBGAs/s1600/dxtreme_monitor_log_11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="796" data-original-width="968" height="263" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfsV-4oWZZI/Wf8j5WvuPxI/AAAAAAAAJCg/MhwO84Wf5Nowk4xXEOXYetYpt7qr54G5wCLcBGAs/s320/dxtreme_monitor_log_11.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Monitor Log 11</b> lets listeners and DXers log the stations they?ve heard using advanced features that can enhance their monitoring experience.<br /><br /><b>Finding Broadcast Stations to Monitor</b><br /><br />The <b>Schedule Checker</b>? lets users import schedules from Aoki, EiBi, and FCC AM web sites and display schedule data according to the filter criteria they specify. A list box lets users switch between schedule types, and depending on the schedule type selected, users can filter schedule information by band, frequency, station, country, city, state, time of day, language, antenna direction, and target area.<br /><br />When the <i>What?s On Now?</i> function is activated, the schedule refreshes automatically at the top of each hour for Aoki and EiBi schedules.<br /><br />For each schedule item, <b>Schedule Checker</b> queries the <b>Monitor Log 11</b> database to let users know ? through user-defined, foreground and background display colors ? whether they need to monitor a station for a brand-new or verified country. <b>Schedule Checker</b> also displays bearing and distance, runs optional <b>Afreet Ham CAP(</b>1) propagation predictions, draws optional <b>Afreet DX Atlas (</b>2) azimuth plots, tunes supported radios to schedule frequencies when users double-click schedule items (3 4 5), and starts log entries for scheduled stations monitored.<br /><br /><b>Finding Amateur Radio Stations to Monitor</b><br /><b></b><br /><b>Monitor Log 11</b> integrates with optional <b>Afreet Band Master (</b>6) to let users see, on its graphical interface, where hams are operating. <b>Monitor Log 11</b> supplies <b>Band Master</b> with an <i>Entity Needed List</i> based on the user?s <b>Monitor Log</b> database, making it possible for <b>Band Master</b> to indicate the stations whose entities (countries) users need to monitor. When invoking <b>Band Master</b>, users can select an <i>Entity Needed List</i> for all bands or individually for the 160- through 6-Meter bands.<br /><br /><b>Finding Utility Stations to Monitor</b><br />A <b>Links</b> menu provides convenient access to user-specified blogs and web sites that can inform users as to where utility and other stations may be operating.<br /><br /><b>Logging Stations</b><br /><b>Monitor Log 11</b> lets users log all kinds of stations ? radio stations, television stations, broadcast stations, Amateur Radio stations, utility stations, military stations, and more! And it lets them log stations across the radio spectrum ? from long wave, to medium wave, to short wave, and beyond.<br /><br />The <b>Last Log Entries Grid </b>on the <b>Monitor Log</b> window shows up to 5000 of the most recent log entries added. Its records can be sorted, and double-clicking records displays detailed data on the <b>Monitor Log</b> window. Users can resize the grid columns and scroll horizontally to columns that do not appear initially. And because the names of stations and NASWA countries can be quite long, users can also display a larger, resizable <b>Last Log Entries <i>window</i></b>. A <b>Properties</b> window lets users change the order of columns, the number of log entries to display, and the font and color attributes of grids and other program components, such as the <b>Content Editor</b> for describing the content monitored, the <b>Script Editor</b> for creating and editing scripts, the <b>Direct Tune</b> interface for tuning radios, and the <b>Comments</b> tab for typing ad hoc comments.<br /><br /><b>Reporting Reception</b><br />Users can create <b>customized paper and e-mail reception reports</b> for sending to stations plus <b>club report entries</b> for reporting catches to clubs and magazines.<br /><br />When users add or display a log entry, <b>Monitor Log 11</b> prepares a post announcing their <i>DX catch</i> and displays it on the <b>Social Media Post</b> tab. From there, users can drag the post to their favorite social media web sites to share their catch with others.<br /><br />Using the <b>Script Editor</b> window, users can create and edit scripts that <i>format</i> reception reports, eReports, and social media posts <i>to their liking</i>. The software prompts users to select the script they want to use. Dozens of scripts come with <b>Monitor Log 11</b>.<br /><br />Users can also print <b>SWL</b> and <b>Address</b> labels on industry-standard label stock, and send <b>eQSL requests</b> to hams automatically through the popular <a href="http://www.eqsl.cc/">www.eQSL.cc</a> site.<br /><br /><b>Imaging</b><br /><b>Improv Imaging</b>? lets users associate ad hoc images with log entries using Capture, Scan, and Clipboard functions. Captures of stations received on digital applications, waterfall displays, facsimile and Amateur TV pictures are popular. The <b>Improv Imaging tab</b> and <b>Application</b> let users view images anytime, and an <b>Improv Image Explorer</b> lets them peruse their entire collection and display associated log entries.<br /><br /><b>QSL Imaging</b>? functions the same as <b>Improv Imaging</b>, but specializes in associating QSL cards and eQSLs with log entries.<br /><br /><b>Other Features</b><br /><b>Rig Control</b> ? Retrieves the frequency and mode from supported radios and permits tuning from the <b>Schedule Checker </b>and <b>Direct Tune</b> interface. Rig control is provided through integration with Afreet Omni-Rig and the SDR applications listed on our web site, currently HDSDR (4) (High Definition Software Defined Radio) and SDR Console (5). <br /><br /><b>Audio Archiving</b> ? An embedded Audio facility lets users maintain an audio archive of stations heard.<br /><br /><b>Reporting</b> ? Produces <b>Performance</b>, <b>Stations</b>, and <b>Log Entry</b> reports that track the performance and progress of the user?s monitoring station. The software lets users FTP those reports to user-provided Web space for remote access. Some reports integrate with Afreet DX Atlas to generate pin maps.<br /><br /><b>Documentation</b> ? Context-sensitive <b>Procedural Help</b>, <b>Field Help</b>, and <b>Microhelp</b> are accessible per window to provide instructions quickly. A web-based <b>Information Center</b> is accessible from the <b>Help</b> menu for late-breaking assistance, and <i>Installation Instructions</i> and a <i>Getting Started Guide</i> are delivered in PDF format with the software.<br /><br /><b>Operating Systems, Pricing, Contact Information</b><br /><b>DXtreme Monitor Log 11</b> runs in 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft® Windows® 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista®, and XP.

April 15, 2017<br /><br />The Amateur Radio on the  International Space Station (ARISS) Program is seeking formal and informal  education institutions and organizations, individually or working together,  to host an Amateur Radio contact with a crew member on board the ISS.&nbsp; ARISS  anticipates that the contact would be held between January 1, 2018 and June  30, 2018. Crew scheduling and ISS orbits will determine the exact  contact dates. To maximize these radio contact opportunities, ARISS  is<br />looking for organizations that will draw large numbers of participants  and integrate the contact into a well-developed education plan.<br /><br />The  deadline to submit a proposal is April 15, 2017.&nbsp; Proposal information and  documents can be found at <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an">www.arrl.org/hosting-an</a>-ariss-contact.<br /><br />The  Opportunity<br />Crew members aboard the International Space Station will  participate in scheduled Amateur Radio contacts. These radio contacts  are approximately 10 minutes in length and allow students to interact<br />with  the astronauts through a question-and-answer session.<br /><br />An ARISS contact is  a voice-only communication opportunity via Amateur Radio between astronauts  and cosmonauts aboard the space station and classrooms and communities. ARISS  contacts afford<br />education audiences the opportunity to learn firsthand  from astronauts what it is like to live and work in space and to  learn about space research conducted on the ISS. Students also will have  an<br />opportunity to learn about satellite communication,  wireless technology, and radio science. Because of the nature of  human spaceflight and the complexity of scheduling activities aboard  the<br />ISS, organizations must demonstrate flexibility to accommodate changes  in dates and times of the radio contact.<br /><br />Amateur Radio organizations  around the world, NASA, and space agencies in Russia, Canada, Japan and  Europe sponsor this educational opportunity by providing the equipment and  operational support to enable direct communication between crew on the ISS  and students around the world via Amateur Radio. In the US, the program is  managed by AMSAT (Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation) and ARRL  (American Radio Relay League) in partnership with NASA and CASIS (Center  for the Advancement of Science in Space).<br /><br />More  Information<br />Interested parties can find more information about the program  at <a href="http://www.ariss.org/">www.ariss.org</a> and <a href="http://www.arrl.org/ARISS">www.arrl.org/ARISS</a>.<br /><br />For proposal  information and more details such as expectations, proposal guidelines and  proposal form, and dates and times of Information Sessions go to <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact">http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact</a>.<br /><br />Please  direct any questions to ariss at arrl.org.<br /><br />[ANS thanks ARISS for the  above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ARISS  News<br /><br />+ A Successful contact was made between Blair Pointe Upper&nbsp;&nbsp;  Elementary School, Peru, IN, USA and Astronaut Shane Kimbrough&nbsp;&nbsp; KE5HOD using  Callsign NA1SS.

Each year, the Dayton Hamvention  honors radio amateurs who have made major contributions to the art and  science of amateur radio. AMSAT Vice President for Human Spaceflight  Frank&nbsp;Bauer, KA3HDO, was named 2017 Amateur of the Year.<br /><br />The award  citation reads:<br /><br />?Frank serves as the Amateur Radio on the International  Space Station (ARISS) international chairman. In the mid-1990s,  Bauer proposed a GPS reception experiment on the AMSAT Phase 3D  satellite (AO-40). The experiment was to measure the signal strength of the  GPS satellite constellation while Phase 3D was in high-Earth orbit  (HEO). The AO-40 experiment subsequently has been cited often in  aerospace literature, as it remained the most comprehensive  above-the-<br />constellation data source for nearly a decade and led to changes  in the system?s specifications and applications. The results of the AO-40  experiment jump started a game-changing transformation in<br />navigation at  HEO/GEO altitudes, enabling new and exciting missions in these  orbits.<br /><br />Bauer holds bachelor?s and master?s degrees in aeronautics  and astronautics from Purdue University. His career in aerospace spans  4 decades within NASA and in private industry<br /><br />Bauer has been licensed  since 1974. In 1983, in preparation for the space mission of Owen Garriott,  W5LFL, he was responsible for setting up and operating the worldwide  retransmission of Space Shuttle air-to-ground communications from Goddard  Amateur Radio Club station WA3NAN.<br />This initiative provided a critical  conduit of information to hams attempting to contact astronaut-hams in the  pre-Internet era.?<br /><br />The 2017 Dayton Hamvention Award winners are listed  at <a href="http://hamvention.org/event-details/awards/">http://hamvention.org/event-details/awards/</a><br /><br />[ANS  thanks Dayton Hamvention via the ARRL for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />VUCC  Awards for February 2017<br /><br />Congratulations to the following satellite  operators who were awarded endorsements for Satellite VUCC by the ARRL  during the period 1Feb2017 thru  1Mar2017:<br /><br />WA4NVM-1413<br />KD8CAO-1200<br />W5PFG-982<br />N8RO-918<br />N7SFI-829<br />K4FEG-711<br />N8HM-608<br />N4UFO-601<br />KG5CCI-452<br />N9IP-417<br />K5ND-200<br />W7QL-180<br />W4DTA-151<br />AI6GS-136<br />N6RFM-107<br /><br />There  were 2 new VUCC awards:<br />WI7P - 829<br />AK4WQ (EN34) - 106<br /><br />The ARRL VUCC  Award is the most prestigious and sought after award for satellite  operators.&nbsp; The award is what inspires all of the roving activity here in the  United States and around the world.&nbsp; A special thanks to all rovers who  make the effort to operate away from home.&nbsp; The Central States VHF Society  sponsors the reverse VUCC award for rovers who operate in 100 or more grids  away from home.&nbsp; Some of our current rovers are already eligible or close to  being eligible for this award.&nbsp; Recipients so far include N7SFI, N5AFV, ND9M  and KD4ZGW.

To maximize resources as it pushes the boundaries of  exploration, the agency is exploring opportunities to take advantage of  emerging private sector space capabilities.<br /><br />NASA released a request for  information Monday regarding possible commercial sources to fly limited  payloads on planned, non-NASA missions to Mars. The agency will use the  responses to gather market data on the complete spectrum of commercial plans,  and identify any excess capacity that may exist for NASA  payloads.<br /><br />Furthering NASA's human deep space exploration goals will  require a significant amount of scientific research, and opportunities  to collect data on Mars have been rare. Only seven successful missions to  the surface of Mars have taken place in the history of  space flight.<br /><br />Evolving capabilities in the private sector have opened  the possibility for NASA to take advantage of commercial opportunities to  land scientific payloads on the surface of the Red Planet. Such capability  would provide an additional method of acquiring science and engineering data  concerning Mars, and would complement NASA's current deep space exploration  efforts.<br /><br />[ANS thanks <a href="http://www.marsdaily.com/">www.marsdaily.com</a> for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Belize  on Satellite<br /><br />Good evening to my fellow people of the birds,<br /><br />The  time has come.

Crew  scheduling&nbsp; and ISS &nbsp;orbits will<br />determine the exact contact dates. To  maximize these radio contact&nbsp;opportunities, ARISS is looking for  organizations that will draw large&nbsp;numbers of&nbsp;participants and integrate  the contact into a well-developed education&nbsp;plan.<br /><br />The deadline to  submit a proposal is April 15,&nbsp; 2017.&nbsp; Proposal information&nbsp;and documents can  be found at <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact">www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact</a>.<br /><br />The  Opportunity&nbsp;Crew&nbsp; members aboard the International Space Station will  participate in&nbsp;scheduled&nbsp; Amateur Radio contacts. These radio contacts are approximately 10&nbsp;minutes in&nbsp; length and allow students to interact with  the astronauts through&nbsp;a question-and-answer session.<br /><br />An ARISS  contact is a voice-only&nbsp; communication opportunity via Amateur&nbsp;Radio between  astronauts and cosmonauts&nbsp; aboard the space station and&nbsp;classrooms and  communities. ARISS contacts afford&nbsp; education audiences the&nbsp;opportunity to  learn firsthand from astronauts what it&nbsp; is like to live and&nbsp;work in&nbsp;space  and to learn about space research conducted on&nbsp; the ISS. Students &nbsp;also<br />will have an opportunity to learn about satellite&nbsp; communication,  wireless&nbsp;technology, and radio science. Because of the nature of&nbsp; human spaceflight and&nbsp;the complexity of scheduling activities aboard the ISS,  organizations must&nbsp;demonstrate flexibility to accommodate changes in dates  and&nbsp; times of the&nbsp;radio contact.<br /><br />Amateur Radio organizations around  the&nbsp; world, NASA, and space agencies in&nbsp;Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe  sponsor this&nbsp; educational opportunity by&nbsp;providing the equipment and  operational support to&nbsp; enable direct&nbsp;communication between crew on the ISS  and students around the world via<br />Amateur Radio.&nbsp;In the US, the program is  managed by AMSAT (Radio&nbsp; Amateur Satellite<br />Corporation) and ARRL (American  Radio Relay League) in partnership with NASA&nbsp;and CASIS (Center for the  Advancement of Science in&nbsp; Space).<br /><br />More Information<br />Interested parties  can find&nbsp; more information about the program at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariss.org/">www.ariss.org</a> and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.arrl.org/ARISS">www.arrl.org/ARISS</a>.<br /><br />For proposal  information and more&nbsp; details such as expectations, proposal&nbsp;guidelines and  proposal form, and dates&nbsp; and times of Information Sessions go&nbsp;to&nbsp; <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact">http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact</a>.&nbsp;Please  direct any&nbsp; questions to&nbsp; <a href="mailto:ariss@arrl.org">ariss@arrl.org</a>.<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />ARISS&nbsp;  is always glad to receive listener reports for the above contacts.&nbsp;ARISS&nbsp;  thanks everyone in advance for their assistance.&nbsp; Feel free to send&nbsp;your&nbsp;  reports to <a href="mailto:aj9n@amsat.org">aj9n@amsat.org</a> or <a href="mailto:aj9n@aol.com">aj9n@aol.com</a>.<br /><br />Listen for the ISS on&nbsp; the  downlink of 145.8Ø&nbsp;  MHz.<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />All&nbsp;  ARISS contacts are made via the Kenwood radio unless otherwise&nbsp;  noted.<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />Several&nbsp;  of you have sent me emails asking about the RAC ARISS website and&nbsp;not being&nbsp;  able to get in.&nbsp; That has now been changed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ariss.org/">http://www.ariss.org/</a><br /><br />Note that there  are links to other ARISS&nbsp; websites from this  site.<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br />Looking&nbsp;  for something new to do?&nbsp; How about receiving DATV from the&nbsp; ISS?<br /><br />If  interested, then please go to the ARISS-EU website for complete&nbsp;details.&nbsp;  Look for the buttons indicating Ham Video.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ariss-eu.org/">http://www.ariss-eu.org/</a><br /><br />If you need  some&nbsp; assistance, ARISS mentor Kerry N6IZW, might be able to&nbsp;provide some&nbsp;  insight.&nbsp; Contact Kerry at&nbsp; <a href="mailto:kbanke@sbcglobal.net">kbanke@sbcglobal.net</a><br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />ARISS&nbsp;  congratulations the following mentors who have now mentored over  100&nbsp;schools:<br /><br />Satoshi 7M3TJZ with 123<br />Gaston ON4WF with&nbsp;  123<br />Francesco IKØWGF with&nbsp;  119<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />The&nbsp;  webpages listed below were all reviewed for accuracy.&nbsp; Out of date&nbsp;webpages  were removed and new ones have been added.&nbsp; If there are&nbsp;additional ARISS  websites I need to know about, please let me know.<br /><br />Note, all times are  approximate.&nbsp; It is recommended that you&nbsp; do your own&nbsp;orbital prediction or  start listening about 10 minutes before&nbsp; the listed&nbsp;time.&nbsp;All dates and  times listed follow International&nbsp; Standard ISO 8601 date and&nbsp;time format&nbsp;  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS<br /><br />The complete schedule page has been updated as of  2017-02-23 05:00 UTC.&nbsp;Here you will find a listing of all scheduled school  contacts, and&nbsp;questions, other ISS related websites, IRLP and Echolink  websites, and&nbsp;instructions for any contact that may be streamed  live.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/ariss/news/arissnews.rtf">http://www.amsat.org/amsat/ariss/news/arissnews.rtf</a><br /><a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/ariss/news/arissnews.txt">http://www.amsat.org/amsat/ariss/news/arissnews.txt</a><br /><br />Total&nbsp;  number of ARISS ISS to earth school events is 1116.&nbsp;Each school counts&nbsp; as 1  event.&nbsp;Total number of ARISS ISS to earth school contacts is 1080.

This radio will replace  the Ericsson radio that failed a few months ago.&nbsp; The VHF radio is used  for school group contacts and amateur packet radio in the Columbus module.&nbsp;  Once the Dragon vehicle is berthed to ISS, the Ericsson will be unstowed and,  at some point, installed in Columbus, replacing the UHF radio that is  now supporting APRS packet and some school contacts.<br /><br />Our  thanks to SpaceX on an outstanding and historic flight from Kennedy Space  Center's Launch Pad 39A, where many Space Shuttle missions&nbsp; and nearly all  the Apollo moon missions were launched.&nbsp; We also would like to thank  our ARISS benefactors-NASA and CASIS, the Center for the Advancement of  Science in Space.&nbsp; And, of course, our amateur radio long-time sponsors-our  national amateur radio organizations around the world, including the American  Radio Relay League (ARRL) in the US, and our international AMSAT  organizations, including AMSAT-NA.<br /><br />&nbsp;Before closing, I want to  let you know that ARISS is making great progress on the development of the  new interoperable radio system that we hope to use to replace our aging radio  infrastructure in the Columbus module and the Service module.&nbsp; The hard (and  expensive) part of this effort is just beginning, with testing and human  certification on the horizon.&nbsp; We thank all that have donated to the cause  thus far.&nbsp; We hope you continue to help ARISS move forward through your  support, including your volunteer time and talent and, of course, financial  contributions through the AMSAT web site<br />donate button.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

The PSLV-C37 lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space  Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh at 03:58 UT on Wednesday, February  15, 2017.<br /><br />Nayif-1 started transmitting about an hour after launch and  radio amateurs in the west of the USA reported the first signals. The  first frame of data received at the Data Warehouse was from Christy  Hunter KB6LTY. Telemetry data was also received by WA6FWF, KA7FVV, WC7V,  NC7V, K6FW, KE7QPV, WA9ONY, W5PFG,&nbsp; KK6AYK.<br /><br />Ken Eaton GW1FKY reports  he received his first frames of data when the satellite came in range of  the UK at 10:07 UT.<br /><br />The satellite looks to be in perfect health and it  was placed in autonomous mode before the end of the first day in orbit.  Just like FUNcube-1, this mode has the spacecraft sending high power  telemetry when in sunlight and with the&nbsp; SSB/CW transponder active when in  eclipse. Already many contacts have been made&nbsp;through the transponder. As  expected, the frequency stability of this spacecraft is much better than  its predecessors.<br /><br />A new post-launch set of TLE?s has been issued by the  launch authority and it can be downloaded from <a href="http://amsat-nl.org/download/NAYIF_TLE.txt">http://amsat-nl.org/download/NAYIF_TLE.txt</a><br /><br />Please  note that these numbers are not based on JSpOC observations so we do  not yet have a valid catalog number.<br /><br />During the Launch and Early  Operation phase (LEOP) of the mission, the Nayif-1 command team have been  headquartered at the American University of Sharjah Ground station in the  United Arab Emirates. They have been very grateful&nbsp;for all the telemetry  received from around the world. It has proven to be immensely useful to the  team in checking that the spacecraft is functioning&nbsp;correctly.<br /><br />Our  world-wide network has greatly impressed the many professionals that have been watching our activities. Already more than 100 ground stations  are submitting data to the Nayif Data Warehouse. Please continue uploading the data as this will further enhance our knowledge about the spacecraft  and the space environment through which it is traveling at 7.6  km/s.<br /><br />The Nayif-1 Data Warehouse has been updated and now includes the  Whole Orbit, High Resolution graphs and the upload ranking. It also  includes telemetry details from the ADCS sub-system ? this is called the iMTQ  and is capable of actively magnetorquing. Over the coming days, we will  be further <br />tweaking the warehouse, so bear with us if it is unavailable  for short periods of time.<br /><br />Background Nayif-1 has been developed by  the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre&nbsp;(MBRSC) and<br />American University of  Sharjah (AUS). The UAE?s first Nanosatellite was developed by Emirati  engineering students from AUS under the supervision of a team of  engineers and specialists from MBRSC within the framework of a partnership  between the two entities, aiming to provide hands-on <br />experience  to engineering students on satellite manufacturing.<br /><br />The spacecraft  includes a U/V linear transponder and telemetry&nbsp;transmitter. It employs  enhanced oscillator circuitry and includes an active attitude determination  and control system.<br /><br />The operating frequencies for the spacecraft  are:<br /><br />Telemetry<br />145.940 MHz using 1k2 BPSK to the FUNcube  standard.<br /><br />SSB/CW Transponder<br />Uplink on 435.045 ? 435.015  MHz<br />Downlink on 145.960 ? 145.990 MHz<br /><br />The Nayif-1 Telemetry Dashboard  can be downloaded from<br /><a href="http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif-1_Dashboard_1039_Installer.msi">http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif-1_Dashboard_1039_Installer.msi</a><br /><br />Guidance  notes<br /><a href="https://funcubetest2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nayif-1_dashboard_notes_release-1-0b.pdf">https://funcubetest2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nayif-1_dashboard_notes_release-1-0b.pdf</a><br /><br />A file to test that the Dashboard and Warehouse  configuration are working correctly<br /><a href="http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif1_testfile.funcubebin">http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif1_testfile.funcubebin</a><br /><br />Nayif-1  Data Warehouse <a href="http://data.amsat-uk.org/nayif1/">http://data.amsat-uk.org/nayif1/</a><br /><br />[ANS  thanks AMSAT-UK for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Satellite  Operators on the Road<br /><br />ZF, CAYMAN ISLANDS. Scott/KA9P and Ron/W9XS will be  active as ZF2SC and ZF2FB, respectively, from the Cayman Islands between  February 22-28th. Activity will be on 40/30/20/17/15 meters and the  satellites. Operations will typically be CW, with a KX1 or KX3, and Buddipole  beams or verticals. QSL via their home callsigns or LoTW.<br /><br />6E, MEXICO.  A group of Ham Radio operators from Southern Mexico will be operating from  some Mayan archaeological sites from the Mexican States of Yucatan, Campeche,  Tabasco, Chiapas and Quintana Roo, using the special callsign 6E3MAYA between  March 18-21st. Activity is to commemorate the Spring Equinox which is so  important for the Mayan culture. Activity will be on 80-6 meters on CW, SSB,  the satellites and the Digital modes. QSL via XE3N.<br /><br />C6, BAHAMAS (IOTA  Op). Operators John/M0IDA, Rob/M0VFC and Steve/M1ACB hope to be active as  C6APY from Little Harbour Cay, Berry Islands (NA-054, WW Locator FL15do).  They will fly into the Bahamas on March 2nd, but it will take them a couple  of days to get to the island, so they hope to be active around March 4th -  but this is very much weather dependent, as is the whole operation. They will  fly back to the UK on March 12th, which means they will need to de-rig on the  10th or 11th, again varying according to the weather. Operation probably  won't be 24/7 - they will do as much operating as they can, but eating and  sleeping is back on the boat, there's only three of them, and they will  probably want to go for the occasional swim as well. They will be running up  to three stations simultaneously, all Elecraft K3s at 100W. They will be  generator powered and have to carry<br />the full week's fuel with them on the  boat, hence no amps. They are expecting that most QSOs will be on 40-15  meters; they will monitor the higher HF bands as well and may venture on to  10/12m if propagation favors them; similarly they may throw up an 80m dipole,  but don't expect to do very much, if anything, there. There will definitely  be CW (op M0VFC) and SSB (ops M0IDA and M1ACB); they may also do some data if  time permits. They should be active on some satellite passes with hand-held  antennas: the FM birds will only cover parts of the USA, and not EU, so they  will<br />attempt some FO-29 passes as well. They are not satellite experts  though, so be patient with them. QSL is via M0OXO's OQRS system. They will  upload the logs to ClubLog and LoTW regularly throughout the trip, assuming  all the kit plays nicely.

Crew scheduling and  ISS orbits will determine the exact contact dates. To maximize these  radio contact opportunities, ARISS is&nbsp;looking<br />for organizations that will  draw large numbers of participants and integrate the contact into a  well-developed education plan.<br /><br />The deadline to submit a proposal is April  15, 2017.&nbsp; Proposal information and documents can be found at <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact">www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact</a>.<br /><br />The  Opportunity<br /><br />Crew members aboard the International Space Station will  participate in scheduled Amateur Radio contacts. These radio contacts are  approximately 10 minutes in length and allow students to interact with the  astronauts&nbsp;through a question-and-answer session.<br /><br />An ARISS contact  is a voice-only communication opportunity via Amateur&nbsp;Radio between  astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station and classrooms  and communities. ARISS contacts afford education audiences the opportunity to learn firsthand from astronauts what it is like to live and work in  space and to learn about space research conducted on the ISS. Students  also will have an opportunity to learn about satellite communication,  wireless technology,&nbsp; and radio science. Because of the nature of human  spaceflight and the complexity of scheduling activities aboard the ISS,  organizations must demonstrate&nbsp;flexibility to accommodate changes in  dates and times of the radio contact.<br /><br />Amateur Radio organizations around  the world, NASA, and space agencies in Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe  sponsor this educational opportunity by providing the equipment and  operational support to enable direct communication between crew on the  ISS and students around the world via Amateur Radio. In the US, the  program is managed by AMSAT (Radio Amateur Satellite&nbsp;Corporation)  and<br />ARRL (American Radio Relay League) in partnership with NASA and CASIS (Center for the Advancement of Science in Space).<br /><br />More  Information<br /><br />Interested parties can find more information about the  program at <a href="http://www.ariss.org/">www.ariss.org</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.arrl.org/ARISS">www.arrl.org/ARISS</a>.<br /><br />For proposal  information and more details such as expectations, proposal guidelines and  proposal form, and dates and times of Information Sessions go to <a href="http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact">http://www.arrl.org/hosting-an-ariss-contact</a>.<br /><br />Please  direct any questions to <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">ariss@arrl.org</a>.<br /><br />[ANS thanks Dave, AA4KN,  for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />RadFXsat-2  Receives IARU Frequency Coordination<br /><br />RadFXSat-2 is a 1U cubesat  technology demonstration mission from Vanderbilt University that has been  accepted for launch as part of NASA?s CubeSat Launch Initiative.

This would be the first amateur radio payload in a geosynchronous orbit, and would significantly enhance communications capabilities for amateur radio operators, in particular following natural disasters or other emergency situations.<br /><br />Amateurs have, of course, been communicating via satellite for decades. The first Orbiting Satellites Carrying Amateur Radio, or OSCAR, satellites were launched in the 1960s. Until now, however, these satellites have been in low Earth orbit (LEO), and were only available for short times when they happened to be overhead.<br /><br />A geosynchronous satellite, however, would be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A geosynchronous orbit has the same period as the Earth?s rotation ? just under 24 hours. That makes them easy to locate and access, as they are almost always in the same spot in the sky. In this case, the satellite will always be within a band of longitudes over the Americas, continually accessible to any amateur radio operator there, including the students and researchers at the Virginia Tech Ground Station.<br /><br />One expected application is emergency communications. This satellite will allow amateur radio operators to help emergency personnel reliably access supplies, logistical support, and medical assistance. They key is to ensure that the satellite would always be accessible to the radio operators ? which is why the geosynchronous orbit is critical.<br /><br />The satellite itself will be operated by Millennium Space Systems on behalf of the United States Air Force; the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation, also known as AMSAT, will operate the radio, which will be designed and built by Virginia Tech students ? making this project a unique collaboration among the university, nonprofit organizations, private companies, and the federal government.<br /><br />The Hume Center team is also engineering a ground terminal that emergency personnel could use to relay their own existing communications channels through the satellite. This setup could be deployed through the American Radio Relay League and the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation as a key part of a robust national emergency response system, allowing trained operators to reliably mobilize to disaster areas in the first critical hours after a devastating event.<br /><br />Questions. I have questions.<br /><br />I?ve taken most of this information from a <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/12/122215-ictas-humegeoradio.html">press release</a> on the Virginia Tech website. The press release raises nearly as many questions as it answers. For example:<br /><ul><li>What can I and other amateur radio operators do to support this effort?</li><li>What frequencies will this satellite use?</li><li>Will amateurs like you and me be able to build their own equipment to access this satellite?</li><li>If so, what kind of equipment will amateur radio operators need to communicate via this satellite?</li></ul>I?ve e-mailed N4HY with these questions. I?ll follow up on this story when I have the answers. This will be an amazing addition to amateur radio, and I?m looking forward to it.<br />UPDATE: There is more information in the QRZ.Com at&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/first-amateur-radio-in-geosynchronous-orbit.505312/">http://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/first-amateur-radio-in-geosynchronous-orbit.505312/</a>, if you want to wade through some the usual baloney that these threads contain.

Dave and his daughter  downloaded the list of questions for the ARISS QSO between Astronaut Shane  Kimbrough and South Street School, Danbury, Connecticut USA. He and Erin  researched the questions and made a list of projected answers for them. The  contact was made with ON4ISS, an ARISS telebridge station in Belgium, and  Erin and Dave were able to listen to the transmission live from from their  QTH in South Yorkshire, UK. Dave videotaped the QSO and posted it online  at:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQbyIH8Qwg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQbyIH8Qwg</a><br /><br />This  is an excellent example of how to integrate Amateur Radio and the the ISS  without being directly part of an ARISS contact. The examples can be used  with any demo or within a planned classroom setting.

By<br />participating in the programme, students will implement  standard practices for spacecraft development; receive support  from experienced ESA specialists; attend tailored training courses;  and<br />will be offered access to state-of-the-art test facilities.<br /><br />ESA  say only launch opportunities from the International Space Station (ISS) are  envisioned, and CubeSat teams applying need to ensure that their mission  complies with a deployment to orbit from<br />the ISS.<br /><br />Further information  at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ANS043-UnivCubesats">http://tinyurl.com/ANS043-UnivCubesats</a><br /><br />UK  Space Agency<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/spacegovuk">https://twitter.com/spacegovuk</a><br /><br />[ANS  thanks ESA via Southgate ARN for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Nayif-1  CubeSat Launch Announced<br /><br />AMSAT-UK and AMSAT-NL are delighted to now be  able to confirm that the Nayif-1 1U CubeSat, which has a full FUNcube  payload, is now scheduled for launch on an Indian PSLV launch vehicle at  03:58 UT on February 15, 2017. The flight, C-37, will be carry a total of  104 satellites into orbit.<br /><br />Nayif-1 has been developed by the Mohammed  bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) and American University of Sharjah (AUS). The  UAE?s first Nanosatellite was developed by Emirati engineering students from  AUS under the supervision of a team of engineers and specialists  from MBRSC within the framework of a partnership between the two  entities, aiming to provide hands-on experience to engineering students  on satellite manufacturing.<br /><br />The spacecraft includes a U/V linear  transponder and telemetry transmitter. It employs enhanced oscillator  circuitry and includes an active attitude determination and control  system.<br /><br />As with previous missions carrying FUNcube payloads, AMSAT-UK  would very much like to receive as many reports from stations around  the world, especially during the first few minutes and hours after launch.  We expect that the first signals may be heard in North America during the mid  evening hours (local time) on Feb 14.<br /><br />There is a mission specific  Telemetry Dashboard for this project and this can be downloaded  from:<br /><br /><a href="http://download.funcube.org.uk/Nayif-1_Dashboard_1038_installer.msi">http://download.funcube.org.uk/Nayif-1_Dashboard_1038_installer.msi</a><br /><br />and,  in a similar way to the FUNcube-1 Dashboard, this will be capable of  uploading the telemetry received to a central Data Warehouse.<br /><br />Guidance  Notes for the installation of the Dashboard, integration with a FUNcube  Dongle and the Data Warehouse have been prepared for the Nayif-1 mission.  These can be downloaded from:<br /><br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ANS043-Nayif-1-Dashboard">http://tinyurl.com/ANS043-Nayif-1-Dashboard</a><br /><br />A  file to test that the Dashboard and Warehouse configuration are working  correctly can be downloaded from: <a href="http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif1_testfile.funcubebin">http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif1_testfile.funcubebin</a><br /><br />The  operating frequencies for the spacecraft will be:<br /><br />Telemetry&nbsp; 145.940  MHz using 1k2 BPSK to the FUNcube standard.<br /><br />SSB/CW Transponder&nbsp; Uplink  on 435.045 ? 435.015 MHz&nbsp; Downlink on 145.960 ? 145.990 MHz<br /><br />Initial  operations of the spacecraft will be in a low power ?safe? mode where only  the telemetry transmitter is activated.<br /><br />More details about the launch,  exact deployment time and pre-launch TLE?s will be made available as soon as  they become available; in the meantime we will really appreciate your  support!<br /><br />[ANS thanks AMSAT-UK for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Nayif-1  UPDATE Pre-launch Keps and more details<br /><br />The launch time for the Nayif-1  CubeSat has been confirmed as 03:58UTC on February 15th 2017 on the PSLV C37  vehicle and a set of pre-launch TLEs have now been  released:<br /><br />NAYIF<br /><br />1 17002U 17002A&nbsp;&nbsp; 17046.17824931 0.00000000&nbsp;  00000-0&nbsp; 00000-0 0&nbsp; 9993<br />2 17002&nbsp; 97.5521 107.5843 0004848 278.6481 296.8511  15.21991390&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01<br /><br />This file can also been downloaded from here <a href="http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif_tle.txt">http://download.funcube.org.uk/nayif_tle.txt</a><br /><br />We  expect that the FUNcube transmitter on Nayif-1 will activate at approximately  05:06UTC, but the exact timing is still to be confirmed!&nbsp; Initial  transmissions will be in ?safe? mode and will be<br />of the 1k2 BPSK telemetry  only with approx 50mW of RF power. If the predictions are correct, the  spacecraft will be heading north over Mexico and the western parts of the US  and Canada.<br /><br />During the Launch and Early Operation phase (LEOP) of the  mission, the Nayif-1 command team will be headquartered at the  American University of Sharjah Ground station in the United Arab  Emirates. They will obviously be especially keen to have all possible  reports of signal reception during this first orbit! To encourage everyone  to take part, there will be a small prize for the station that submits the  first data to the Nayif-1 Data Warehouse and perhaps an extra reward if they  manage to receive the very first frame transmitted by the spacecraft! This  should have the sequence number 5471 or 5472.<br /><br />Details of the Nayif-1  frequencies, together with details of how to the download the Dashboard can  be found here<br /><br /><a href="https://funcube.org.uk/2017/02/08/nayif-1-launch-date-now-confirmed/">https://funcube.org.uk/2017/02/08/nayif-1-launch-date-now-confirmed/</a><br /><br />The  Data Warehouse is still under final development but a preview can be seen  here: <a href="http://data.amsat-uk.org/nayif1/index">http://data.amsat-uk.org/nayif1/index</a><br /><br />Please  note that if you are already a registered user of the FUNcube Dashboard then  you do not need to re-register. Your existing details will transfer  automatically to the new Dashboard when you run it for the first  time.<br /><br />If you run the test file with the Nayif-1 Dashboard please do  not expect the Warehouse to show the data - it is from an earlier  date than that is already displayed. However the ?packets uploaded? tab  at<br />the bottom right corner of your Dashboard will show that the files have  uploaded OK, that all is well with your system and that it is ready for  action.<br /><br />We are hoping that the actual launch will be webstreamed and  details of this will be made available as soon as possible.&nbsp; The AMSAT-UK  and -NL team will also be using the #funcube IRC channel<br />on launch day and  you will be very welcome to join them there. If you do not have the Dashboard  available then please submit your heard reports here.

Yuri does not process qsl requests when he  is not on a ship.<br /><br />The following procedure only applies to contacts  made during this season from the M/V Chestnut. Previous seasons will be  handled by his manager Eugene, UX0FY.&nbsp; Eugene has all the logs for previous  seasons and can be contacted through his qrz.com email address.&nbsp;  Please contact Eugene before sending anything in the mail to him and ask  for instructions on how to proceed.<br /><br />You may prepare a logsheet of  QSO's that Yuri can print, verify, sign and mail from one of his destination  ports.&nbsp; An example of a suitable logsheet can be found at papays.com/sat  under the UT1FG/MM QSL Instructions link at the top of the  page.<br /><br />Please use the following conventions when preparing the  logsheet:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; List only one contact per grid.<br />2.&nbsp; Only request  confirmations of NEW Grids.<br />3.&nbsp; Use Excel or a similar program to create the  logsheet.<br />4.&nbsp; Save the Logsheet to a .pdf&nbsp; If your program cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save  to a .pdf, download a free program like Bullzip&nbsp;that will install a .pdf  printer that you can print to&nbsp;and create a .pdf file.<br />5.&nbsp; Each page  should stand alone; there should be a&nbsp;place for Yuri's signature on each  page.<br />6.&nbsp; Incude your COMPLETE Mailing Address on each page.<br />7.&nbsp; Name the  logsheet file with this format:&nbsp;Yourcall_UT1FG_DateLastQSO&nbsp;for  example:&nbsp; DJ8MS_UT1FG_10Feb2017.pdf<br />8.&nbsp; Email your file as an attachment  to:&nbsp;k8yse at papays.com with the subject line the same as the .pdf  file name:&nbsp; DJ8MS_UT1FG_10Feb2017<br />10. Please be sure to follow the example on  the&nbsp;website papays.com/sat/ut1fgqsl.html&nbsp; Consistency&nbsp;&nbsp; will help  Yuri process requests more efficiently.<br />11. If there are qso's on your list  that are not in the&nbsp;log, Yuri will draw a line through them and  initial.<br /><br />I will send an acknowledgement email when I receive a request.&nbsp;  This way you will know that Yuri will have your logsheet.<br /><br />If Yuri  tells me that he has mailed your logsheet, I will post that information on  the bulletin boards.<br /><br />Yuri's time when nearing or in port is very limited.  He has a lot of responsibilities to carry out and large amounts of paper to  process along with requests from his Company.&nbsp; He has more time when he  is sailing. Let that guide you when deciding when you email  your requests.&nbsp; A good time to mail&nbsp; your request is when Yuri is about  5 days from making port.&nbsp; Follow him at marinetraffic.com (M/V Chestnut -  bulk Cargo).<br /><br />This new procedure may be changed or stopped depending on  how it goes.&nbsp; Hopefully this will work well and Yuri will find it  acceptable.<br /><br />We are very fortunate that Yuri operates from so many water  grids that otherwise would never be on the satellites.&nbsp; His passion  for satellites is amazing. Have fun working him.<br /><br />[ANS thanks John  K8YSE for the above  information]<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Live  HAMTV Video Planned for ARISS Contact<br /><br />The HAMTV experiment is planned  transmit live video during the ARISS contact with Collège André Malraux,  Chatelaillon-Plage, France on Mon 2017-02-13 14:00:35 UTC.<br /><br />The HAMTV  video downlink is on 2395 MHz (DVB-S,SR2000,fec 1/2, PID video 256, PID audio  257, Mp eg2 codec).
