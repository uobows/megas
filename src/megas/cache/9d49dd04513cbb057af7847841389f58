<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The recent surge of attention given to sexual harassment has laid bare a long silence about the reality of women?s working lives. As a practitioner and now researcher in sexual harassment law reform, it is a conversation I never imagined taking place on this scale. Yet there are still important gaps in it.</p>
<p>Our thinking around sexual harassment in the workplace is both too much about sex, and not enough. By concentrating on sexual behaviours alone, we overlook women?s non-sexual experiences of being denigrated or undermined at work.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-is-not-enough-it-has-yet-to-shift-the-power-imbalances-that-would-bring-about-gender-equality-92108">#MeToo is not enough: it has yet to shift the power imbalances that would bring about gender equality</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>At the same time, discussions of sexual harassment are also not enough about sex. They ignore one of the most damaging consequences of harassment: the chilling effect on women?s sexual expression and behaviour.</p>
<h2>When sexual harassment is too much about sex</h2>
<p>When we think of sexual harassment, we typically think of a young woman subjected to the unwanted sexual attention of a (usually older) man. This focus on sex suggests that women are disadvantaged by individual acts of sexual aggression, rather than more systemic inequalities. The remedy for sexual harassment then becomes dealing with those individual men, with a select few publicly targeted and losing current positions or contracts.</p>
<p>This approach diminishes the many non-sexual acts that make workplaces hostile to women. These can often be subtle and cumulative.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/business/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/348371/Women-and-the-Future-of-Work-Report_Final_060318.pdf">recent Australian study</a>, women reported ? alongside sexual harassment ? men being preferentially promoted because they were seen as more confident. Women felt they had to to dress differently, or take off a wedding ring to avoid assumptions about child-bearing. They also reported being ?treated like a moron?, and not taken seriously compared to men. These undermining acts are arguably <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-03471-006">even more damaging</a> than sexual harassment.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211508/original/file-20180322-165587-19iplv1.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">In a recent study, women reported forms of discrimination such as men being preferentially promoted because they were perceived as more confident.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/download/confirm/370034096?src=a_7nXoR-eLm--rpI3WWyyw-1-82&amp;size=huge_jpg">Shutterstock</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When women are treated unequally at work because of their sex, this may still be protected as a form of sex discrimination, but non-sexual behaviours have not received the same level of public attention that sexual harassment has. The separation of sexual and non-sexual mistreatment has <a href="http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2002/22.html">artificially created two seemingly distinct categories of gender inequality</a> and channelled attention to the sexual. Non-sexual acts that contribute to women?s inequality are overshadowed by the racier stories of harassment, and since less visible, are even harder to pinpoint and prove.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-exposes-legal-failures-but-trial-by-twitter-isnt-one-of-them-92683">#MeToo exposes legal failures, but ?trial by Twitter' isn?t one of them</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>In law, courts have struggled to characterise certain behaviours as ?sexual? enough to fit within sexual harassment. In 1996, the Supreme Court of Victoria awkwardly held that <a href="https://victorianreports.com.au/judgment/view/1997-2-VR-127">repeated and invasive declarations of love</a> by an employer were ?sexual?, bringing them within the law. In <a href="http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HREOCA/1997/52.html">another case</a>, a discrimination complaint was undermined by treating sexual acts (cutting women?s bra straps in a workplace ritual) as separate from non-sexual acts (calling a senior woman a ?mother hen? and her team the ?nursery?), rather than as evidence of a whole environment hostile to women.</p>
<p><a href="http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2011/35.html">More recently</a>, a case failed when a woman could not show that the series of non-sexual acts she complained of (male colleagues turning off equipment taps so tightly that she could not use them, ignoring her, and being treated as less authoritative than junior male colleagues) were because of her gender. Sexual behaviours by men, in contrast, are presumed to be directed at and harmful to women.</p>
<h2>Sexual harassment is not enough about sex</h2>
<p>The impact of sexual harassment is typically thought of as temporary distress, with a potentially wider professional impact when women lose work opportunities by refusing sexual advances. What has still been overlooked is the impact of sexual harassment on women?s sexual development and agency.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment reverberates far beyond an individual perpetrator or act. The chilling effect of constant low-level policing of sexual boundaries takes a wider toll on women?s sexuality. This is because they are forced to modify themselves ? their appearance, their speech, their interactions with men ? in response to anticipated as well as actual male behaviour.</p>
<p>Young women are particularly subject to sexual harassment, and their sexuality often develops in that context. While around <a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/chapter-1-working-without-fear-results-sexual-harassment-national-telephone-survey-2012-0">a third of Australian women</a> have been sexually harassed, a <a href="http://www.unitedvoicevic.org.au/hospo_sexual_harassment_survey">recent survey of hospitality workers</a>, disproportionately female and young, found 89% had experienced harassment. Actor Natalie Portman <a href="http://time.com/5111739/natalie-portman-times-up-womens-march-speech/">said recently</a> that receiving rape fantasy fan mail and being sexualised in the media as a teenager forced her to adopt a ?prudish? persona to feel safe and respected.</p>
<p>Recent discussions about sexual harassment have largely ignored these significant sexual harms, for which there is little recognition and no legal remedy, while unnecessarily sexualising broader gender inequality.</p>
<p>How can we address these subtle, but serious, harms? Sexual harassment laws have existed in Australia for decades, but addressing inequality takes more than law. We can only fix the damage we can see.</p>
<p>We need to look beyond individual sexual misbehaviour to the wider meaning of sex in sexual harassment, and reform our current laws based on a broader understanding of women?s sexual and non-sexual experiences of inequality.</p>

<p>UTS Business School Associate Professor Sarah Kaine and RMIT Professor Cathy Brigden have launched a <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/save-womens-stories">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money for an oral history project that will record these stories for posterity and inspire future generations.</p>
<p>?We realised there was an imbalance in the stories of people who battled to make things better in the workplace. The current recorded history focuses on men ? there is a lack of stories about women who fought for their rights and the rights of those around them,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to seek out 50 women who were activists between 1968 and the present, from a wide range of backgrounds, and record them in their own words via face-to-face interviews. The interviews will then be made available to the public via a web archive.</p>
<p>?There is something really powerful and inspiring about hearing people speak in their own words about their experiences ? hearing them tell stories of everyday bravery that has often come at a personal cost in terms of pressure on them and their families,? says Associate Professor Kaine. </p>
<p>The project will include interviews with senior union figures involved in major campaigns, people like former ACTU president Jennie George, but it will also include lesser-known women, ?everyday heroes? who have inspiring stories of challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>As well as asking for public support to fund the project, the researchers are looking for help in uncovering the women activists who helped shape their workplaces, whether in capital cities or regional areas, and from all cultures and backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of the women already interviewed is cleaner Chris Wagland, a union leader and activist for the rights of workers in the cleaning industry. Wagland has worked as a cleaner for more than 30 years, and became involved in activism when her workplace refused to pay long-service leave and other worker entitlements.</p>
<p>?The biggest barrier is always to get people to take that big leap into the unknown, to put their hands up? that?s the power that people don?t realise they have. No matter how much your voice wavers, or you get upset or your knees shake,? says Wagland.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/235320342">Wagland?s story</a> about how she stepped up and held her ground, despite threats and bullying, is the kind of story the researchers are looking for ? one that will help others realise that change is possible. </p>
<p>The stories will include issues from the late 60s to current times ? from harassment or underpayment, to the gender pay gap, maternity leave, issues with contract work, or continually being a casual or contingent worker.</p>
<p>?We chose 1968 because it was a pivotal time in terms of politics and the women?s movement, and it will enable us to investigate both broader social change, and change across the union movement. This is a living history project, so we will also include current stories,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>In 1968 workplace conditions for women were very different from today. Many workplaces only employed women if they were single and forced women to resign when they got married. Paying women less than men for the same role was normal and there was no maternity leave, paid or unpaid.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment was also not illegal until 1984 and even then, only if it led to disadvantage in the workplace. It was only included in the Sex Discrimination Bill because of pressure from activists.</p>
<p>?The website will be a place where personal memories can become collective memories, where they can be shared, and preserved for history,? says Associate Professor Kaine,</p>
<p>The Australian Services Union, National Tertiary Education Union and United Voice have provided Initial seed funding to develop the website. The project is supported by the UTS Centre for Business and Social Innovation, which aims to examine issues around social access, equity and fairness at work.</p>

Do you pride yourself on never lying, cheating or stealing?</p>
<p>Well, we may <em>think</em> our morals are set in stone but new research reveals our standards may be more easily influenced than we think ? possibly for ill, but preferably for good.</p>
<p>A series of experiments has revealed that changing the way people process information ? by priming them to have a particular mindset ? leads to differences in how they subsequently judge the morality of a particular behaviour, and how they themselves behave.</p>
<p>?Morality has been extensively explored in literature and philosophy, and there are two main approaches to moral reasoning,? explains lead researcher <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/geetanjali.saluja">Dr Geetanjali Saluja</a> from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p>
<p>The first view of morality is a very fixed, rule-based approach, where a particular action is considered either right or wrong ? for example, it is always wrong to commit murder (what?s known as the deontological perspective).</p>
<p>The second view of morality is more flexible and takes into consideration whether the means justify the ends ? for example stealing might be okay if it is taking from the rich to give to the poor (the consequentialist perspective).</p>
<p>The researchers primed some participants to have a more ?flexible? approach to morality by asking them to analyse and judge a range of news items one by one. Other participants were primed to have a more ?fixed? approach to morality by asking them to judge the news items as a collection, rather than making individual assessments of each one.</p>
<p>?We found that changing someone?s mindset ? how they processed the information ? changed their moral outlook when presented with a hypothetical situation a short time later,? says Dr Saluja, a marketing researcher with UTS Business School.</p>
<p>One of the hypothetical situations researchers presented to participants was a story about someone who accidently collected extra change from a café barista but did not return it.</p>
<p>They were asked how moral or immoral they found this person?s behaviour and how certain they were about that judgment.</p>
<p>The results showed that participants who had been primed to view information on an individual basis were more likely to see taking the extra change as okay.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who were primed to make a ?global? judgment about information were more certain about the immorality of the situation.</p>
<p>Another experiment examined whether participants were more or less open to downloading pirated movies.</p>
<p>Those who previously judged information on an individual basis were more likely to entertain the idea of illegal downloads than those who had earlier made a ?global? judgement.</p>
<p>A final experiment revealed that inducing a ?global? mindset encouraged participants to be more generous to fellow students ? in this case offering them a ?lucky draw ticket?.</p>
<p>?If we understand what shifts moral values, then we can perhaps influence consumers to act in more ethical ways, such as reducing the trade in illegal wildlife or pirated goods,? says Dr Saluja.</p>
<p>?Helping people think about the overall picture, or the global view, and how behaviours are good or bad for society, is likely to encourage more moral behaviour,? she says.</p>

<p>The detail of the government?s reforms remains elusive four months after the commission?s <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/Report.aspx#_Findings">final report</a> was handed down. However, the challenges to implementation and justice are clear.</p>

<hr /><h2>Recommendations that fall short</h2>
<p>A key demand of advocates for youth justice reform has been to <a href="https://shutyouthprisonsmparntwe.wordpress.com/">shut down detention centres</a>. Their view is detention has failed children and damaged lives.</p>
<p>The commission identified this failure, but it fell short of recommending their closure. Instead, it proposed purpose-built detention centres. The government <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">has announced</a> it will build two new detention centres.</p>
<p>The recommendation to establish 20 family support centres is likely to reproduce old ways of managing Indigenous families without a clear imperative to reduce the removal of children from families.</p>
<p>Without increased resources being given to Indigenous families, communities and organisations to maintain the wellbeing of their children based on Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing, these centres will only replicate established institutional practices of managing children.</p>
<p>That there are only 20 centres means they will not provide place-based care across the hundreds of Indigenous communities and homelands in the NT.</p>
<p>The recommendation to consult and partner with Aboriginal Peak Organisations in developing an Aboriginal Out-of-Home Care Strategy may not give Indigenous communities a voice.</p>
<p>The commission heard that since <a href="https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/politics/northern-territory-emergency-response-intervention">the Intervention</a> in 2007, government consultation has become a dirty word in Indigenous communities. They <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2016/Transcript-12-October-2016.pdf">feel betrayed</a> by the Commonwealth government, which consults only after policies are decided.</p>
<p>Where Indigenous organisations spoke out against government policy, their organisations <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2017/Transcript-21-June-2017.pdf">were defunded</a>. The commitment that is needed therefore is not simply one of consultation, but empowerment.</p>
<p>The commission noted two officers displayed particularly egregious conduct, but did not recommend charges be laid against them or detention managers be held to account. This continues the lack of justice for the young people tortured in detention.</p>
<p>Matters that have gone before the courts paint a bleak picture.</p>
<p>In 2014, Alice Springs detention supervisor Derek Tasker was prosecuted in the NT Supreme Court for choking Dylan Voller and bashing his head against a cell wall. The footage of this incident showed 14-year-old Voller quietly sitting in his cell when Tasker grabbed him. The court found Tasker?s actions were reasonable and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-08/guard-involved-in-stripping-voller-to-front-royal-commission/8336788">he was acquitted</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, a civil case was brought by four of the six Indigenous boys who were gassed in Don Dale?s isolation unit in 2014. Despite all bar one having been sitting in their cell passively, the court found the gassing was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-21/don-dale-teenagers-gassed-win-civil-lawsuit-against-nt-govt/8373768">?reasonable and necessary?</a> and did not award compensation for this aspect of the claim.</p>
<h2>The NT government?s reticence</h2>
<p>Ninety-one of the commission?s recommendations have received <a href="http://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/nt-govt-to-accept-all-227-royal-commission-findings/news-story/426a74f396e98142527c9ddd9879d8c2">mere in-principle support</a>. This includes the controversial measure to increase criminal liability from ten to 12 years of age, and to keep kids under 14 out of detention centres.</p>
<p>This would make the NT the first Australian jurisdiction to lift the age of criminal responsibility from ten. While not substantially reducing the youth detention population, it would prevent the brutalisation of the youngest and most-vulnerable children.</p>
<p>The NT government has continuously referred to the need for the federal government to step up to its responsibility to care for children, especially <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">by matching</a> its initial $50 million funding commitment.</p>
<p>But youth justice and child protection are squarely in the domain of the states and territories. The federal government?s failure to act would be a weak basis for the NT government to disavow its responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Ideology gets in the way</h2>
<p>Policing of young people alongside a government mantra of ?tough on crime? have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-indigenous-kids-in-detention-in-the-nt-in-the-first-place-63257">major push factors</a> for Indigenous children becoming increasingly detained in the NT over the past decade.</p>
<p>This approach has continued unabated: the government unleashed the Territory Response Group police unit to monitor young people immediately after the royal commission concluded.</p>

<hr /><p>The NT government continues to refer to children in detention as <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24304">?problem youth?</a>, and its goal as creating <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">?safer communities?</a>. Such a persistent focus on children as a criminal risk subordinates a focus on children?s human rights.</p>
<p>Indigenous witnesses from remote communities who came before the commission spoke about the devastating effect the Intervention had on their capacity to care for their children.</p>
<p>These witnesses referred to the bureaucratisation of Indigenous services that had previously been community-run and its regime of discriminatory controls. They described the torture in Don Dale as an extension of the Intervention and requiring immediate repeal.</p>
<p>However, in responding to the commission, the federal government <a href="https://www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/news/2018/australian-government-response-to-the-royal-commission-into-the-protection-and-detention-of-children-in-the-northern-territory">said</a> it would not revisit its role in the NT.</p>
<h2>A bigger shift is needed</h2>
<p>When the commission?s final report was handed down, NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">said</a> the findings were ?a stain on the Northern Territory reputation?. But this stain will continue to spread if there is only reform at the margins.</p>
<p>Implementation must proceed on the basis that penal institutions have failed Indigenous children, and upholding the commission?s intent requires a reinvestment in Indigenous models of social, cultural and emotional wellbeing.</p>

Its meteoric rise over the last 12 months has made it a daily conversation staple, even among people who normally spend their time bitching about the price of Sydney real estate instead. Here's what happened: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/900-20000-bitcoins-historic-2017-price-run-revisited/" target="_blank">In December 2016, bitcoin was trading at around $900.

While it's recovered somewhat (today, it's trading at about $14,000), the currency's peaks and troughs have always been volatile, based partly on its finite supply (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins released</a>) ? but that seems to be part of the appeal.  </span></p>

<p><span id="part1"><strong>2.</strong>       <strong>Bitcoin's the icing, blockchain's the cake</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="part1">If you're going to invest in bitcoin, you should probably know a little bit about blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Essentially, blockchain is a digital ledger that records bitcoin transactions via a decentralised computer network. When a bitcoin transaction is made, blockchain provides a report to the network about the results, adding the new block of encrypted, verified data to the existing chain of information contained within the ledger (clear as mud? Read this <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank">beginner's guide to blockchain</a>). The lure of blockchain is that it's been designed to be incorruptible ? information can't be removed or erased from the chain after it's added, and blockchain has a built-in consensus protocol that basically prevents dodgy bastards from coming in and hacking the system. In short, it solves problems of trust, reputation and transparency ? three key areas of risk when it comes to online transactions. What's more, blockchain can do much more than just verify bitcoin transactions ? in future, it has the potential to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/11/21/smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-businesses-reap-the-benefits/#4bf28a3d1074" target="_blank">deliver smart contracts</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/11/17/what-is-blockchain-used-for-besides-bitcoin/#4bdd1666446e" target="_blank">prevent voter fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/24/blockchain-bitcoin-technology-most-important-tech-invention-of-our-age-sir-mark-walport" target="_blank">issue passports and record land registries, to name a few.  </a></span></p>

  </div>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">The last couple of years has seen the rise of <a href="http://lentilasanything.com/about/">restaurants</a>, <a href="https://rsecure.metmuseum.org/admissions">museums</a> and other businesses allowing customers to pay as they want. There may be altruistic reasons for companies to adopt this pricing, but research shows that ?pay what you want? pricing can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">sometimes lead to an increase in revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Adopting pay what you want does increase the risk for businesses, as customers can easily pay nothing, or less than the seller?s costs. However, the fact that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">most customers still pay significantly more than zero</a>, and that revenue can actually increase, shows people make purchase decisions for many reasons, including a perception of fairness.</p>
<p>Businesses can use several strategies to increase revenue, such as posting signs with suggested prices, or donating money to charity.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-economics-behind-ubers-new-pricing-model-78180">The economics behind Uber?s new pricing model</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Research on pay what you want <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">is mixed</a>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2011.07.003">One study</a> tracking a pay-what-you-want restaurant over two years found that the average meal payment decreased but the number of daily guests increased, which meant total revenue increased.</p>
<p>However, in other cases, pay what you want did not provide an increase in revenue. A recent example is the <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/pay-what-you-can-afford-restaurant-forced-close">closure last year of the Footscray Lentil as Anything restaurant</a>.</p>
<p>In general, pay what you want is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">most effective in low-competition marketplaces</a>.</p>
<p>The rock band Radiohead famously <a href="http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html">used pay what you want</a> to sell one of its albums online. New York?s Metropolitan Museum of Art used a <a href="https://rsecure.metmuseum.org/admissions">pay-as-you-wish admission policy</a> for 50 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> also uses a pay-what-you-want model to fund itself.</p>
<h2>Why pay as you want can be profitable</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why pay as you want <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">could be profitable</a>.</p>
<p>Pay as you want allows for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp">price discrimination</a>. Normally this means companies try to extract the most a customer would be willing to pay by offering different services, such as extra legroom on planes, for example.</p>
<p>Think about how much you would pay for a smashed avocado breakfast. For some people, the answer is A$10. For others it is A$20. A restaurant that prices its smashed avo at A$15 may be losing some customers (those willing to pay only A$10) and also fail to capture the full value from other customers (those who would have been willing to pay A$20).</p>
<p>By allowing people to pay as they want the restaurant can successfully cater to both types of customers.</p>
<p>Pay as you want can also be used to undercut the competition. While a competitor has posted its prices in a menu or on a website, customers can always pay less at the pay-as-you-want business. This can not only increase the number of customers to the pay as you want business, but could drive competitors out of the market.</p>
<p>In that sense, pay as you want lends itself to businesses that want to sell as many products as possible ? they are appealing to all price points and are technically the cheapest option.</p>
<h2>Why do people pay more than zero?</h2>
<p>If a customer was perfectly rational then they would always pay zero to a pay-as-you-want business.</p>
<p>But research shows that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">most people are inherently pro-social</a>, meaning they engage in altruistic actions that have no direct benefits to themselves.</p>
<p>Paying more than zero is also a ?<a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">signal</a>? to others that we are fair. Paying zero for a product that obviously cost the seller something to produce would make the customer appear unreasonable to those around them, which would <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1120893109">violate their self-image as a good person</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.11.004">A customer may value the product enough</a> that they want to help the seller stay in business. After all, if no one pays then a seller will close down and the customer will lose access to the product.</p>

<h2>Strategies to increase pay-as-you-want revenue</h2>
<p>For a pay-as-you-want strategy to be effective, customers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41272-017-0078-0">must perceive</a> the product to be of good quality and have high satisfaction with the transaction.

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">The last couple of years has seen the rise of <a href="http://lentilasanything.com/about/">restaurants</a>, <a href="https://rsecure.metmuseum.org/admissions">museums</a> and other businesses allowing customers to pay as they want. There may be altruistic reasons for companies to adopt this pricing, but research shows that ?pay what you want? pricing can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">sometimes lead to an increase in revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Adopting pay what you want does increase the risk for businesses, as customers can easily pay nothing, or less than the seller?s costs. However, the fact that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">most customers still pay significantly more than zero</a>, and that revenue can actually increase, shows people make purchase decisions for many reasons, including a perception of fairness.</p>
<p>Businesses can use several strategies to increase revenue, such as posting signs with suggested prices, or donating money to charity.</p>

<hr /><p>Research on pay what you want <a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">is mixed</a>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2011.07.003">One study</a> tracking a pay-what-you-want restaurant over two years found that the average meal payment decreased but the number of daily guests increased, which meant total revenue increased.</p>
<p>However, in other cases, pay what you want did not provide an increase in revenue. A recent example is the <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/pay-what-you-can-afford-restaurant-forced-close">closure last year of the Footscray Lentil as Anything restaurant</a>.</p>
<p>In general, pay what you want is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">most effective in low-competition marketplaces</a>.</p>
<p>The rock band Radiohead famously <a href="http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html">used pay what you want</a> to sell one of its albums online. New York?s Metropolitan Museum of Art used a <a href="https://rsecure.metmuseum.org/admissions">pay-as-you-wish admission policy</a> for 50 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> also uses a pay-what-you-want model to fund itself.</p>
<h2>Why pay as you want can be profitable</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why pay as you want <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">could be profitable</a>.</p>
<p>Pay as you want allows for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp">price discrimination</a>. Normally this means companies try to extract the most a customer would be willing to pay by offering different services, such as extra legroom on planes, for example.</p>
<p>Think about how much you would pay for a smashed avocado breakfast. For some people, the answer is A$10. For others it is A$20. A restaurant that prices its smashed avo at A$15 may be losing some customers (those willing to pay only A$10) and also fail to capture the full value from other customers (those who would have been willing to pay A$20).</p>
<p>By allowing people to pay as they want the restaurant can successfully cater to both types of customers.</p>
<p>Pay as you want can also be used to undercut the competition. While a competitor has posted its prices in a menu or on a website, customers can always pay less at the pay-as-you-want business. This can not only increase the number of customers to the pay as you want business, but could drive competitors out of the market.</p>
<p>In that sense, pay as you want lends itself to businesses that want to sell as many products as possible ? they are appealing to all price points and are technically the cheapest option.</p>
<h2>Why do people pay more than zero?</h2>
<p>If a customer was perfectly rational then they would always pay zero to a pay-as-you-want business.</p>
<p>But research shows that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1946">most people are inherently pro-social</a>, meaning they engage in altruistic actions that have no direct benefits to themselves.</p>
<p>Paying more than zero is also a ?<a href="https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.44">signal</a>? to others that we are fair. Paying zero for a product that obviously cost the seller something to produce would make the customer appear unreasonable to those around them, which would <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1120893109">violate their self-image as a good person</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.11.004">A customer may value the product enough</a> that they want to help the seller stay in business. After all, if no one pays then a seller will close down and the customer will lose access to the product.</p>

<h2>Strategies to increase pay-as-you-want revenue</h2>
<p>For a pay-as-you-want strategy to be effective, customers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41272-017-0078-0">must perceive</a> the product to be of good quality and have high satisfaction with the transaction. Beyond this basic necessity sellers can employ numerous strategies to increase revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.09.015">Customers pay more</a> when provided with a reasonable suggested price. A seller may put up a sign saying ?a meal like ours would cost you $20 next door?, for example. A suggested price serves to anchor customer?s expectations and helps make clear what might otherwise be a confusing situation at the till.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0276146712448193">Customers will also pay more</a> when provided with information about ?socially correct? behaviour. For example, a seller may put up a sign indicating that ?90% of people pay more than the cost price of our meals?. This kind of information helps customers understand what behaviour is considered normal and expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1186744">Customers also pay more</a> when a portion of their payment is directed to charity. Charity donation provides customers with a ?warm glow? feeling and presents the seller as socially responsible.</p>
<p>The next time you are buying a product, reflect on what you would pay if free to choose. It might be higher than you think.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Private individuals rather than public figures have emerged as the primary source of defamation in the digital age, a study by the Centre for Media Transition at the University of Technology Sydney shows.</p>
<p>Over a five-year period between 2013 to 2017 just over one in five (21 per cent) of plaintiffs in defamation case judgements were public figures ? and just over a quarter of defendants (25.9 per cent) were media companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/node/247996/about/projects/trends-digital-defamation">The findings</a> contradict common assumptions about public figures being the main users of defamation laws.</p>
<p>They show it is more common for private individuals to be the plaintiffs in defamation actions. Private individuals are also more likely to be the defendants (sometimes with their employers).</p>
<p>It also confirms that NSW is the defamation capital of Australia, with more matters reaching a substantive decision than the rest of the country combined.</p>
<p>In addition to the five-year snapshot, the study also looked at 2007 as a ?pre-social? comparison.</p>
<p>?The proportion of digital cases ? arising from publication in social media, websites, email and messaging ? has increased substantially, from just over 17 per cent in 2007 to more than 53 per cent in 2017,? said co-director of the Centre for Media Transition <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/derek.wilding">Professor Derek Wilding</a>.</p>
<p>?The landscape for legal disputes around reputation is changing, as the question ?who is a publisher? continues to evolve.?</p>
<p>The study identified 189 core cases, and in total it located 609 decisions related to these cases, and another 322 cases that were still running from earlier years or just starting out. The study captures information on defamation matters over this period, but the full picture on defamation is likely to involve even more litigation activity.</p>
<p>?As the law evolves, we see publishers ? whether big or small ? caught up in many protracted disputes,? Professor Wilding said. ?This chain of litigation requires a major commitment of time and resources from plaintiffs and publishers alike.?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-media-transition">Centre for Media Transition</a>, a joint venture between UTS Law and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, has been set up to examine new business models for journalism, best practice in journalism and the legal and legislative restrictions that affect journalism, civil debate and the public?s right to know.</p>
<p>Professor Wilding said the study highlighted the growing influence of social platforms and websites not affiliated with media companies as the source of legal disputes.</p>
<p>The study showed a wide variation in the form of digital publication:  </p>
<ul><li>There were 16 cases involving Facebook posts, 20 involving emails, four involving tweets and two involving text messages</li>
<li>There were 37 cases involving websites not affiliated with media organisations, Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>There were three cases (all relating to search results) in which Google was the defendant.</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/peter.fray">Professor Peter Fray</a>, co-director of the centre and a former news editor, executive and journalist said, ?This study prompts us to think about the conditions for free expression in this country.</p>
<p>?Developments in technology and user expectations provide many of us with the opportunity to publish our views. There must be a role for public policy in moving us away from costly and time-consuming legal disputes.?</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Private individuals rather than public figures have emerged as the primary source of defamation in the digital age, a study by the Centre for Media Transition at the University of Technology Sydney shows.</p>
<p>Over a five-year period between 2013 to 2017 just over one in five (21 per cent) of plaintiffs in defamation case judgements were public figures ? and just over a quarter of defendants (25.9 per cent) were media companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/node/247996/about/projects/trends-digital-defamation">The findings</a> contradict common assumptions about public figures being the main users of defamation laws.</p>
<p>They show it is more common for private individuals to be the plaintiffs in defamation actions. Private individuals are also more likely to be the defendants (sometimes with their employers).</p>
<p>It also confirms that NSW is the defamation capital of Australia, with more matters reaching a substantive decision than the rest of the country combined.</p>
<p>In addition to the five-year snapshot, the study also looked at 2007 as a ?pre-social? comparison.</p>
<p>?The proportion of digital cases ? arising from publication in social media, websites, email and messaging ? has increased substantially, from just over 17 per cent in 2007 to more than 53 per cent in 2017,? said co-director of the Centre for Media Transition <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/derek.wilding">Professor Derek Wilding</a>.</p>
<p>?The landscape for legal disputes around reputation is changing, as the question ?who is a publisher? continues to evolve.?</p>
<p>The study identified 189 core cases, and in total it located 609 decisions related to these cases, and another 322 cases that were still running from earlier years or just starting out. The study captures information on defamation matters over this period, but the full picture on defamation is likely to involve even more litigation activity.</p>
<p>?As the law evolves, we see publishers ? whether big or small ? caught up in many protracted disputes,? Professor Wilding said. ?This chain of litigation requires a major commitment of time and resources from plaintiffs and publishers alike.?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-media-transition">Centre for Media Transition</a>, a joint venture between UTS Law and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, has been set up to examine new business models for journalism, best practice in journalism and the legal and legislative restrictions that affect journalism, civil debate and the public?s right to know.</p>
<p>Professor Wilding said the study highlighted the growing influence of social platforms and websites not affiliated with media companies as the source of legal disputes.</p>
<p>The study showed a wide variation in the form of digital publication:  </p>
<ul><li>There were 16 cases involving Facebook posts, 20 involving emails, four involving tweets and two involving text messages</li>
<li>There were 37 cases involving websites not affiliated with media organisations, Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>There were three cases (all relating to search results) in which Google was the defendant.</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/peter.fray">Professor Peter Fray</a>, co-director of the centre and a former news editor, executive and journalist said, ?This study prompts us to think about the conditions for free expression in this country.</p>
<p>?Developments in technology and user expectations provide many of us with the opportunity to publish our views. There must be a role for public policy in moving us away from costly and time-consuming legal disputes.?</p>

<p class="uts-lead">Parents of babies born with heart disease are likely to benefit from routine cardiac genetic counselling to reduce risk, prevent future disease and improve treatment outcomes, according to world-first research led by UNSW Sydney, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and the Sydney Children?s Hospitals Network.</p>
<p>In a study of one hundred parents of children with congenital heart disease who had surgery between 2000 and 2009, almost all parents showed clear preference for a single genetics appointment with both a specialised clinical geneticist and genetic counsellor, offered as soon as possible after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Lead author UNSW Associate Professor Nadine Kasparian, and co-authors Dr Richard De Abreu Lourenco and Professor Rosalie Viney from the UTS Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, said the study, published in Genetics in Medicine, showed that meeting a specialised clinical geneticist and cardiac genetic counsellor, supported by online health resources, was a high priority for parents of children with heart disease.</p>
<p>?This study highlights an important gap between what parents feel they need and what is currently available,? says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>?Specialised paediatric cardiac genetics services can provide information about genetic and other risk factors associated with a child?s heart condition, as well as offer emotional support to alleviate the feelings of guilt, fear and sadness parents so often feel.?</p>
<p>Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with congenital heart disease, which includes malformations of the heart, heart valves or major blood vessels. Worldwide there are about 1.35 million babies diagnosed with congenital heart disease each year. It is a leading cause of infant death and one of the most common reasons babies are admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>After diagnosis of congenital heart disease, paediatric cardiologists usually discuss the possible genetic implications with parents, however referrals to a cardiac genetics service are less common. Funding of additional resources would allow more referrals to properly structured congenital heart genetics clinics.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Kasparian says the great majority of parents of babies with congenital heart disease would like to be offered this service, with 93% of parents in the study indicating they would attend an appointment with a specialised clinical geneticist and counsellor, if offered within two weeks of referral.</p>
<p>?In order to plan services, we need to understand the needs of the people the service is supposed to help?, says co-author and clinical geneticist UNSW Conjoint Professor Edwin Kirk. ?In this study, we heard from parents about their ideal service. We may not always be able to reach the ideal, but this gives us a clear goal to aim for.?</p>
<p>The study showed the presence of a genetic counsellor in addition to a geneticist made it even more likely for parents to attend the appointment.</p>
<p>?The genetics landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are learning more about the genetics of childhood heart disease every day,? says UNSW Associate Professor Kasparian. ?This study shows the need for greater resources and new models of care. There are important discoveries being made at molecular level and our services need to be ready for when these discoveries are translated into clinical care.?</p>
<p>More resources, funding and workforce training are needed before the model of care preferred by parents could be implemented, says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>?The growing demands for paediatric cardiac genetics services means genetic counsellors, working with cardiac teams, could play a greater role in the care of children with heart disease and their families,? says Associate Professor Kasparian.</p>
<p>The study comes as Health Minister Greg Hunt announced on February 14 the first National Action Plan to discover treatments for thousands of Australians affected by childhood heart disease. It will be important that we extend that action to the delivery of services that better meet the needs of parents of children with heart disease.</p>
