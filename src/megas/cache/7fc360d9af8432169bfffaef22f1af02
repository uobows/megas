Don't become addicted to strict diets. Try to vary food in your daily  ration and make it more balanced. Though strict diet may guarantee a quick  weight loss, such food limitations are usually a short-term solution only. In  most cases these restrictions lead to vitamin deficiency, fatigue and loss of  muscle. Less muscle and muscle tone means a slower metabolism and consequently  fewer calories burned 24 hours-a-day. Moreover, strict diet doesn't teach you  how to acquire health habits and improve your lifestyle. It works like  self-delusion: you rely on the quickly achieved result and return to the former  lifestyle. Ultimately after going off an extreme diet you gain the weight lost  back within a year or less.<br />In order to avoid Yo Yo Dieting i strongly recommend to refuse from all those  radical diets and create your own plan of healthy lifestyle which can be  observed during a long-time period and which makes you lose weight gradually.  The more slowly you lose weight the higher probability you will not gain it  back.<br />2. A high consumption of virgin oil, vegetables and fruits, fish, milk and  cheese, nuts etc. not only enriches your daily ration with all indispensable  vitamins and elements but also helps reduce weight and prevent many  diseases.<br />Habitants of Mediterranean countries are guided by the principle to consume  the mentioned products everyday. People bound to Mediterranean Diet have a 70%  more of expectancy of life and a 80% of better quality of life, supposing they  do not smoke. Mediterranean Diet prevents stroke, heart attack, metabolic  syndrome, lung diseases, Parkinson, Alzheimer and helps keep the bone mass in  elderly people.<br />3. Eat frequently but reduce portion sizes. Mini meals make your blood sugar  stay at normal level and it guarantees that you will never get too hungry and  lose control of your portion intake. I advice you to eat salad before lunch or  dinner and it will help curb appetite and give you a sense of satiety  sooner.<br />4. Consume dairy products<br />Milk is a good source of protein, zinc, B vitamins and calcium. The recent  studies show that calcium is not only a bone-building element but it also helps  lose weight. Due to the research those who consumed 3 servings of low-fat dairy  products a day lost more than 10% of their body weight. Those who took calcium  supplements or those who had little calcium in their diet lost only 6% of their  body weight.<br />5. Take enough sleep. If you don't get enough hours of sleep your metabolism  will not function properly and it may cause hormone imbalance. Hormone ghrelin  increases hunger, and when you are sleep-deprived, you have more ghrelin. Leptin  decreases hunger, but when you are sleep-deprived, you have less leptin.  Consequently you eat more plus your metabolism slows and you gain more  weight.<br />6. Learn to manage stress. When you are under stress your body produces  adrenalin and cortisol - 2 stress hormones which may affect your weight.  Cortisol causes elevated blood sugar levels, which also trigger the release of  insulin, causing the body to store fat, instead of burning protein. Adrenalin  also increases sugar levels in the blood and it leads to glucose/insulin  imbalance which strengthen your appetite.<br />7. Combine cardio and strength training. Cardio exercises boost metabolism,  elevate serotonin levels in the brain and make your body burn calories faster.  Strength training can help enhance your muscle mass and develop strong bones. As  you gain muscle, your body gains a bigger "engine" to burn calories more  efficiently.<br />8. Increase quality protein intake which helps improve muscle function and  prevent muscle loss during weight loss. Proteins also lower blood levels of  triglycerides which helps leptin get into your brain easier and therefore you  feel full on fewer calories.<br />9. Drink an adequate amount of water. The process of burning calories  requires sufficient supply of water otherwise dehydration will slow down the  fat-burning process. If you drink water before every meal you will feel full  sooner and therefore u become satisfied with less amount of calories.<br />10. Always remind yourself: "I can. I'm strong". Weight loss programme  requires constant efforts and determination therefore any obstacle or failure  shouldn't discourage or distract you from your main goal - to get perfect and  seductive body.</div><div id="article-resource"><br /><a href="http://magazine-mn.com/" target="_new">http://magazine-mn.com/</a>  Magazine MN (beauty, health, business, career, success, leadership,  marketing)</div>Article Source:    <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Natalie_Myhalnytska">http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Natalie_Myhalnytska</a>";s:12:"link_replies";s:174:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/feeds/3657735884877263548/comments/defaulthttp://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-lose-weight-and-avoid-yo-yo.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/3657735884877263548";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/3657735884877263548";s:4:"link";s:83:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-lose-weight-and-avoid-yo-yo.html";s:11:"author_name";s:15:"FatBurningMummy";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13261659967784047066";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:7;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3649803911188076942.post-6194246653203502116";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-02-12T18:14:00.000+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-02-12T18:14:52.587+00:00";s:5:"title";s:46:"Whitney Houston Dies - The Passing of a legend";s:12:"atom_content";s:1453:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CzW_dcu6D_A/TzgBVSgvhOI/AAAAAAAAAPA/XiHlWw-ZfRk/s1600/Whitney-Houston1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" sda="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CzW_dcu6D_A/TzgBVSgvhOI/AAAAAAAAAPA/XiHlWw-ZfRk/s200/Whitney-Houston1.jpg" width="145" /></a></div>I couldn't let the day pass without mentioning Whitney Houston, regardless of the main content of my blog.<br />I was shocked, like many others&nbsp;when I heard of the death of Whitney Houston. I, and many of her fans I'm sure, were happy to see her two years ago as she made her steps towards her&nbsp;career comeback. I had bought her last album and absolutely loved playing track seven, <em>I Didn't Know My Own Strength - </em>a track that you just knew she sang from her heart and soul. A track that I'm sure a lot of listeners could relate to.<br /><br />She was The Voice. Her music and voice will always be remembered. I'll always remember being in High School and dancing around the room to her first track, <em>I Wanna Dance With Somebody</em>, and watching the colourful video that accompanied the track.<br /><br />My condolences go out to her daughter, <em>Bobbi Christina</em> and all her family.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hD1Jm5Jtdis" width="420"></iframe>";s:12:"link_replies";s:178:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/feeds/6194246653203502116/comments/defaulthttp://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/whitney-houston-dies-passing-of-legend.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/6194246653203502116";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/6194246653203502116";s:4:"link";s:87:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/whitney-houston-dies-passing-of-legend.html";s:11:"author_name";s:15:"FatBurningMummy";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13261659967784047066";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:8;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3649803911188076942.post-1423490667098938305";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-02-12T16:45:00.000+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-02-12T16:45:56.872+00:00";s:5:"title";s:48:"Part 2: Have You Got the Motivation to Exercise?";s:12:"atom_content";s:910:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ixdx12wBOM4/Toe1pNmtA5I/AAAAAAAAALQ/Vn6hfRVTni4/s1600/weight-gain-health-factors.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="132" sda="true" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ixdx12wBOM4/Toe1pNmtA5I/AAAAAAAAALQ/Vn6hfRVTni4/s200/weight-gain-health-factors.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Need the motivation to exercise?

Are you sticking to your resolutions?<br />If one of your resolutions was to exercise more, how have you been at sticking to this? With this cold weather I know how difficult it can be to motivate yourself to exercise. I should know!The early morning workouts I did last year have so far become non-existent. <br /><br />Not exercising enough has likely been the&nbsp;contributing factor to why I haven't&nbsp;been blogging over the last two months. Or maybe not blogging has contributed to&nbsp;my not exercising enough!&nbsp;Recording my fat-burning journey and mentioning exercise and nutrition on this blog has been very helpful to my trim-down goal. It seems that keeping a record or a journal of your exercise/weight loss goal can keep you on the right path.<br /><br />I have been doing a few minutes of stretching in the morning, plus there's all the walking I do each day when taking my DDs to and from school. But its time to get back on that path and do more. Just writing this has now spurred me on to exercise.<br />Are you keeping a record or journal&nbsp;of your exercise/weight loss goal?";s:12:"link_replies";s:148:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/feeds/7049152381473530716/comments/defaulthttp://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-year.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/7049152381473530716";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/7049152381473530716";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-year.html";s:11:"author_name";s:15:"FatBurningMummy";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13261659967784047066";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:10;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3649803911188076942.post-8830547821792603847";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-12-23T16:52:00.001+00:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-12-23T17:43:08.598+00:00";s:5:"title";s:27:"A Diabetic Christmas Dinner";s:12:"atom_content";s:1575:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1lBCV1ayfo/TvSxmPojVaI/AAAAAAAAAOI/wAxF88h7NKA/s1600/turkey.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1lBCV1ayfo/TvSxmPojVaI/AAAAAAAAAOI/wAxF88h7NKA/s200/turkey.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />Are you diabetic or having diabetic guests over for Christmas Dinner?

I love 'em. Especially with <em>Ambrosia </em>custard. This Christmas weakness usually begins late October when&nbsp;my main&nbsp;supermarket starts stocking them. I mus say though, I have consumed less this year than last year and with a few days to go before Christmas, the cupboard has been bare of mince pies for at least a week now. I am eating them in moderation, while still thinking of the calories...do they do low-calorie mince pies? With all the walking that I do, I know I am burning off some of those consumed calories. I'm sure I'll have a couple on Christmas Day, while watching <em>Downton Abbey</em> but then that's it...Christmas will be over.

I sure do. But it's always a naughty but nice feeling when I bite into one.<br />I came across an article that gives you the&nbsp;worst biscuits to eat if you're trying to trim your weight, number&nbsp;20 being the worst.<br /><br />20. <strong><em>Tesco</em> All Butter Shortbread Fingers</strong> - the worst for saturated fat.<br />19.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Fox's</em> Crunch Creams </strong>- one of the worst for saturated fat plus there's a heaped teaspoon of sugar in each biscuit.<br />18.<em> <strong>Cadbury</strong></em><strong> Crunchie Bisuit - </strong>The worst for sugar content; one of the highest bisuits for fat content.<br />17. <strong><em>Jammy Dodgers - </em></strong>has more than a heaped sugar in each; there's no real raspberry in the centre.<br />16. <strong><em>Fox's Viennese - </em></strong>Contains the highest fat content in a chocolate biscuit; contains hydrogenated vegetable oil - not good!<br />15. <strong>McVitie's Milk Chocolate Digestive -&nbsp; </strong>Contains twice as much sugar as a plain digestive.<br />14. <strong>Cadbury Chocolate Rich Tea -</strong> Contains twice the amount of sugar AND twice the number of calories as a McVities plain Rich Tea.<br />13<strong>. McVities Chocolate Hobnobs - </strong>Compared to plain hobnobs they have seven times the amount of saturated fat AND nearly twice the amount of sugar.<br />12. <strong>Tesco Value Bourbon Creams -</strong> The cream centre has almost 10% of your daily intake of saturated fat.<br />11. <strong>Crawfords Custard Creams - </strong>Contains more fat, more saturated fats and more sugar than Asda's smartprice brand.<br />10. <strong>Asda Smartprice Custard Creams</strong> - Contains less calories and sugar but has a high saturated fat content (as with all creamy centre biscuits).<br />9. <strong>Fox's Crinkles Coconut -</strong> High in sugar and saturated fats.<br />8. <strong>Maryland Chocolate Chip Cookies -</strong> Only 57 calories per cookie, but eating two or three is equivalent in saturated fat content as eating a two-fingered Kit Kat!<br />7. <strong>McVitie's Jaffa Cakes</strong> - Only 46 calories per biscuit AND contains 1g of fat, BUT is high in sugar.<br />6. <strong>Tesco Value &nbsp;Ginger Nuts</strong> - &nbsp;Only 46 calories and 2g of fat per biscuit; is a healthy biscuit to choose&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains approx. one-tenth of your iron daily allowance.<br />5. <strong>McVitie's Ginger Nuts</strong> - Contains slightly less fat than a Tesco Value Ginger Nut.<br />4. Fox's Malted Milk - 43 calories and 1.9g of fat; high malt and milk content; low sugar and saturated fat content.<br />3. McVitie's Digestive - A great source of fibre because of the wholewheat content. This brand contains a lower saturated fat content than other digestive brands.<br />2. McVitie's Oaty HobNobs - 67 calories and 1.3 g of fat; very good for fibre - three biscuits gives you 10% of your daily allowance;&nbsp;gives a steady release of energy; high sugar content.<br /><div align="center">?</div><br /><div align="center"><strong><u>The Best Biscuit</u></strong></div><div align="center"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>1.

You keep beating up on yourself when you haven't exercised. You keep telling yourself that you haven't got the time to exercise. Perhaps it's time to stop calling it 'exercise'.<br />The word sounds like such a chore...and who likes doing chores. It's something you do because you have to, not because you enjoy it. You want to get it out of the way, and subconsciously you're clock-watching, waiting for it to be over.<br />If you're trying to lose weight, don't exercise...do fat-burning (activities). This is what I've been doing for the last four weeks. As much as I love doing Tae Bo and Harvey's <em>Fighting Fit Fighting Fat</em> DVDs, I want to keep myself physically active, as much as possible, each day.<br />It doesn't have to be something requiring you to change into workout gear. There are lots of fat-burning activities you can do per day/per week, that will contribute to you trimming down your weight. Recently, I've done the following:<br /><ul><li>Putting on a children's CD and dancing around the living room with my two young DDs</li><li>Putting on my salsa/merengue CDs and doing salsa dancing/zumba-like fitness, while cooking, cleaning, tidying up.</li><li>Brushing up, instead of vacuuming. I've found brushing a carpet requires more energy than vacuuming. I've incorporated waist twists&nbsp;for even&nbsp;more fat-burn.</li><li>My own armlifts - no, not using weights...but my three year old daughter! This started by chance, when I lifted my daughter into the air and put her back down...and she wanted me to do it again...and again...and again...and again...It's now a regular in our household. I'm not complaining!</li><li>Lifting up both my DDs on either side of me and being a human see-saw! This they enjoy!</li><li>Being a lover of Strictly Come Dancing, who would love to learn the 'old fashioned' dances, I like to pick up either of my daughters, and dance the foxtrot..or the tango...and the waltz, and waltz around the room. They love it! My DDs sure aren't light (at 3 and 5), so I'm certainly developing some muscles in my arms when I lift them!</li><li>Occasionally walking back from school after taking first my eldest, then my youngest(in the afternoon). 'Power walking' to school&nbsp;to pick them up. It's about a twenty-five minute walk to school, but I often get there in fifteen minutes!Yee har!</li><li>Walking up and down the stairs at home, as much as possible per day.</li></ul>I've been noticing the difference too - I'm looking a little trimmer, and have had a few comments from people too, so I guess I must be doing something right. I've also been changing how I eat...but I'll leave that for another blog post.<br />A little bit really does make a difference, and it hasn't felt like a chore at all.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UvSR1WYbeBE/TrZwIB8hb_I/AAAAAAAAAMA/9pXe6pNf8NU/s1600/Enjoylifeandneverstopdancing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UvSR1WYbeBE/TrZwIB8hb_I/AAAAAAAAAMA/9pXe6pNf8NU/s1600/Enjoylifeandneverstopdancing.jpg" /></a></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:174:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/feeds/5997227507179834233/comments/defaulthttp://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2011/11/little-bit-makes-lot-of-difference.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/5997227507179834233";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3649803911188076942/posts/default/5997227507179834233";s:4:"link";s:83:"http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2011/11/little-bit-makes-lot-of-difference.html";s:11:"author_name";s:15:"FatBurningMummy";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13261659967784047066";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:20;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3649803911188076942.post-4138332186229940755";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-10-08T00:31:00.000+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-10-08T00:31:27.020+01:00";s:5:"title";s:21:"The Early Bird Again!";s:12:"atom_content";s:2025:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i8_E6RcVhfw/To-E6z5DzLI/AAAAAAAAALo/FwN7QXQ0EmM/s1600/clock+alarm.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i8_E6RcVhfw/To-E6z5DzLI/AAAAAAAAALo/FwN7QXQ0EmM/s200/clock+alarm.gif" width="191" /></a></div><div align="center"></div>After falling asleep as soon as I put my DDs to bed last night, I woke up alert enough to do&nbsp;an early morning workout (5.50am exactly). I ignored the fact that it was still dark outside and slipped my workout DVD into the player. <br />This morning, it was the turn of a TAE-BO workout. I poured a large glass of water and got to 'work'. I started with the Basic workout but then fast forward to the Advanced workout. That was more like it. I worked up a sweat and enjoyed all the punches and kick exercises. It felt good. Maybe I had some aggression to get out...<br />If you're looking for a different type of workout from what you're used to seeing, then as well as checking out <a href="http://fatburningmummy.blogspot.com/2011/09/yee-har.html">Harvey's Fighting Fat, Fighting Fit</a> as I previously posted about, then you should check out and try Tae Bo. Ideal for men and women, so get your partner to do a workout with you. I used to love doing&nbsp;Tae Bo many years ago, before my DDs arrived, but like so many other things, Tae Bo and exercising got&nbsp;put on the back burner.
