I need to make a record of specific dates and milestones of her achievements because she is growing so quickly. That being said, since arriving home, our lives have been filled with a flurry of medical assessments, doctors appointments, referrals to specialists and long days in waiting rooms.   Sometimes I question if it's all necessary.   So much so, that I recently cancelled a scheduled MRI because I just wasn't convinced the need was justified (and after consulting with her specialist). &nbsp; She was born 6 weeks premature, and with a medical condition that may, or may not affect her brain.  At this point, she is not showing any signs of a neurological defect, except for some general delays.      So, I seem to vacillate between immense pride in her accomplishments,  and fear and worry over her being slightly delayed.    When we picked her up she was 11 months old and couldn't sit up on her own, crawl or use a pincher grasp.

Sometimes I question if it's all necessary.   So much so, that I recently cancelled a scheduled MRI because I just wasn't convinced the need was justified (and after consulting with her specialist). &nbsp; She was born 6 weeks premature, and with a medical condition that may, or may not affect her brain.

It was a 4 hour drive and gave us a great opportunity to see the sights along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were so many thoughts going through my mind, most of all&nbsp;the amazing way that God lead us to Poland, so far outside of our little bubble and in a way that&nbsp;only He could've ordained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over I just kept thanking God for this experience, and Karolina.</em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Our hotel was clean and nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Are you kidding?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim and I looked at each other with our palms sweating and our knees knocking.&nbsp;&nbsp; We nervously awaited her arrival until the door finally opened with a little bundle wrapped in a pink blanket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

On April 12 we left the states for Poland.&nbsp; Our trip was nearly 24 hours but we were energized with the realization that we were on our way to our little girl!&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a layover in Amsterdam and flew into Warsaw where we waited for a driver to take us to the region where Karolina is.&nbsp; It was a 4 hour drive and gave us a great opportunity to see the sights along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were so many thoughts going through my mind, most of all&nbsp;the amazing way that God lead us to Poland, so far outside of our little bubble and in a way that&nbsp;only He could've ordained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over I just kept thanking God for this experience, and Karolina.</em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Our hotel was clean and nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Are you kidding?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim and I looked at each other with our palms sweating and our knees knocking.&nbsp;&nbsp; We nervously awaited her arrival until the door finally opened with a little bundle wrapped in a pink blanket.&nbsp;&nbsp; They unwrapped her...and there SHE WAS!&nbsp;&nbsp; What a beautiful face!&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin was so perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp; Her cuddly body was so healthy and strong!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>We held her and I prepared myself that she might not look me in the eye or respond with affection.&nbsp; In our adoption classes, we were told to expect that might happen, &nbsp;and we understood completely.&nbsp;

She suggested we auction the "rare" edition on eBay, &nbsp;and use the money for our adoption fund.&nbsp; Great idea mom!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never seen a Pope John Paul II comic before,&nbsp; and I thought she might be on to something.&nbsp;
