In total, the team will have 7 freshmen competing for playing time and trying to show what they are capable of at the college level. No one knows for sure who will be the most valuable first-year player, but most are banking on Kameron Chatman to stand out early.<br /><br />&nbsp;Standing at 6?7? tall, Chapman has the size and athleticism to be a standout at the forward position almost right away. He was a top 50 recruit out of Oregon, and he is hoping to play the same type of role as Glenn Robinson III played a season ago.  When the team went over to Italy, Chatman was able to show right away that he has some leadership qualities out on the floor. He was able to put up a lot of shots, and he was the scoring leader among freshmen in those games. He has mostly played under control, although he has had some freshman mistakes that he is hoping to work through as the season moves along.  In the John Beilein system, shooting three-point shots come pretty naturally. Chatman has shown so far that he is pretty proficient from deep.<br /><br />What makes the coaching staff a little bit worried is the fact that he is not getting to the line as much as a guy his size should. Once he adds a little bit of muscle and feels more confident at this level, he should be able to get to the line for some easy points.  Anyone who plays <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/fantasy-basketball">fantasy basketball</a> at the college level should definitely be looking at Chatman as a guy who could be one of the most impressive freshman players in the Big Ten. Not only does he have the skill to be a solid contributor right away, but he also will be given the opportunity basically out of necessity for a young Michigan squad.

Batman: The Movie 1966 (RT 79%)</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/Batman1966Poster.jpg/220px-Batman1966Poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/Batman1966Poster.jpg/220px-Batman1966Poster.jpg" height="400" width="262" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This was the first Batman I came know as a 4 year old watching the Adam West reruns after pre-school. My cousin and I would run to the playground singing the awesome theme song and fight over who was Batman and who was Robin. Its funny to think that This was BATMAN before the Dark Knight Returns was published.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://filmdump.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman-1966-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://filmdump.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman-1966-1.jpg" height="226" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The movie now is pure cheese. It is just a funny watching it now with the rubber sharks and a giant bombs. You also have Joker with a stash and every villain you could want. I can't get many to watch this with me. My wife hates it but I like to laugh at how 4-7 year old Ryan knew Batman.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">9.Batman:Under The Red Hood ( RT 100%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://images.alphacoders.com/157/157673.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://images.alphacoders.com/157/157673.jpg" height="472" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Ok guys there will be a lot of DC animated stuff on here so don't freak out. Most this stuff is better then the live action stuff. This one the is pretty good one. The red hood follows the story the Red Hood who taking over Gotham's crime lords with violence and force. Batman is still not over Todd's death(2nd Robin.. Don't worry no one liked him anyway) and the big crime lord in town gets Joker out to help kill off the red hood.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Its full of action and a bit of gore. Its not as grounded as some of the other DC animated Batman stuff but its a good mash of the Red Hood and Death in the family. Its only 75 mins and packed full of action with very little drag. Bruce Greenwood does an ok Job doing Batman but there have been better. The Joker has a bit of a different voicing with John DeMiggio but I liked him. Music could have been better but not much to complain about here.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">8.Batman Year One(RT 86%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This is based off the Frank Miller graphic novel Year One. It does a great job sticking to the style and story of the source and gets the mood just right. Its Batman's first year as the dark knight and it takes him a while to find him groove while Gordon is the new cop in town who isn't standing down to the crooked cops.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/batman-year-one-6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/batman-year-one-6.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">If you like Gordon then you get a lot of him here. You get all his problems on the home front with his pregnant wife and his issues with falling in love with a blond who is courting him on the force. Bruce and Gordon both fighting for the same thing which puts them on a collision course with each other. You can even seen some ideas that were grabbed from these books that Nolan used in Begins. Its my 2nd favorite Batman comic and could easily be put up higher on this list.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">7.Batman Mask of the Phantasm(RT 81%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://076dd0a50e0c1255009e-bd4b8aabaca29897bc751dfaf75b290c.r40.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/files/001/635/342/original/original.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://076dd0a50e0c1255009e-bd4b8aabaca29897bc751dfaf75b290c.r40.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/files/001/635/342/original/original.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">If you seen Batman the animated series then you know how good this movie is. I saw this in the theaters on Christmas day when it released. It blew me away. It was the first cartoon I saw that had blood which I thought was amazing as a kid. They pulled no punches with this one and the story and plot of the movie is outstanding.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://076dd0a50e0c1255009e-bd4b8aabaca29897bc751dfaf75b290c.r40.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/files/001/633/982/original/original.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://076dd0a50e0c1255009e-bd4b8aabaca29897bc751dfaf75b290c.r40.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/files/001/633/982/original/original.jpg" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Batman is falling in love and is thinking about hanging it up. It does some great origin stuff as well to get you up to speed with things. There is this new scary dude running around town killing all the mob guys in creepy ways. This movie also has a nice twist you don't see coming. The voice acting is some of the best since you get Mark Hamill doing his iconic Joker voice and Kevin Conroy(the best Bat voice ever). Its really to bad the movie flopped at the theater and has only picked up cult steam over the years. There is a good follow up as well that just missed my list called Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker(RT 86%). Check that out if you find yourself wanting more.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">6.Batman The Dark Knight Rises(RT 88%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flicksandbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-dark-knight-rises-bane-batman-3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.flicksandbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-dark-knight-rises-bane-batman-3.jpg" height="358" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Out of the Nolan movies this one had fans fighting with each other on whether it was good,great or bad. Topping the The Dark Knight was going to be near impossible. I liked Rises a lot. When I saw it I liked it more then Begins but after more viewings of both I come to like Begins more. Its just stronger overall.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I love Tom Hardy as Bane. He did a great job stealing a lot of this movie. When he wasn't on screen all you could think was "When is BANE going to be back?" My biggest grip was how they did him in the end. He wasn't this big bad leader. He was just a women's tool. He went out like a chump from Cat women. After building him up all movie they destroyed the aura they built. Having Batman fighting him to the death would have been way more epic. As a fan who loves his origin comic and has it graded and framed that Bane would have never taken orders from anyone else.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.themobhasspoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dark-knight-rises-2.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.themobhasspoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dark-knight-rises-2.jpeg" height="512" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Ok now that my Bane rant is over the movie is still great and one of the best 3rd movies in series with Last Crusade and BTTF III. Its hard getting three great movies and Nolan did it here. I enjoy the little twist in the end. Its pure Nolan to let you decide what really happened.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">5.Batman Begins(RT 85%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/site_furniture/2007/11/27/batmanbegins460.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/site_furniture/2007/11/27/batmanbegins460.jpg" height="384" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When I saw this coming in 2004 I didn't even care(not even one Yahoo search was given). It came out in 2005 and I still didn't care. Up to that point I had seen every Batman movie on day one. I was abused so bad by Returns, Forever and B&amp;R that I just had no faith in it being any good. Then a funny thing happened. It started getting good reviews and it picked up steady steam in the movie theaters. Rumors were it was pretty damn good. So I saw it in IMAX. Found it to be a breath of fresh air. Gone were bright neon lights and Batman on ice skates. Now I was treated to a dark logical Batman. I also love that these movies aren't special effect fests(Say that 10x fast).&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://viewerscommentary.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman-begins-the-tumbler.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://viewerscommentary.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman-begins-the-tumbler.png" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">dBegins is a very good origin story that grabs from different comics and puts them together really well(even had the bats from year one!). Bale knocked it out of the park for me. I even liked his voice that so many people complain about or now had become a pretty funny joke in movies and on the web. It also took huge balls not to come with the Joker right away and take that risk of a 2nd movie not ever seeing the light of day. The movie gets away with some villains that not every movie goer knows much about or understands. Nolan pulled it off and set up for the best comic trilogy ever. My only issue with the movie was the closely filmed fighting scenes. Other wise it blasted Batman back to the top in the 2000s.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">4.The Dark Knight Returns Pt.1(RT 100%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.shortboxpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-1-trailer-L-Tk1CFg.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.shortboxpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-1-trailer-L-Tk1CFg.jpeg" height="356" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I am going to gush a bit about this one. Its my favorite comic ever and movie is near flawless in following it up. I have all the issues framed, I've read it many times... I love it. In 1986 Frank Miller wrote the comic that changed Batman forever. If you haven't read it. Go now. Get a copy and read it.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://larryfire.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/batman-the-dark-knight-returns-frank-miller-dc-comics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://larryfire.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/batman-the-dark-knight-returns-frank-miller-dc-comics.jpg" height="320" width="206" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Ok got that out of my system. DC went all out and did a great job taking the comic and putting it into a 2 part movie. I am so glad they didn't try to fit this amazing book into 2 hours. It would have been missing to much. Part 1 sets the tone that the comic did. Bruce is old and not sure how to spend his days. The thought of dying a normal old man death is driving him nuts. Gordon is retiring and Gotham has forgotten Batman so much that some think hes a myth. Bruce paid to have Harvey Dent's face fixed. A new gang has taken a hold of the city with terrible crimes and Murder. Bruce is torn on if he should just sit on his hands or return to the night.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fbCQec7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/fbCQec7.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I don't want to give away to much but the music, voice acting and pace of the movie are amazing. Peter Weller(Robocop) does a great old and pissed off Batman but does have moments where you wish he brought some more. The Dark Knight Returns has so many quotes that are awesome and the gets most of them in there and nails them.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/6701_5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/6701_5.jpg" height="223" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">To me this is Batman's end story and it starts here. He's old and had enough. If you can't read the comics just go rent this. Its one of the finest Batman movies you will see and Part 2 only gets better.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">3.Batman 1989(RT 71%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://wagthemovie.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman5.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://wagthemovie.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/batman5.jpeg" height="426" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Batman 1989 took what I knew about 1966 Batman and threw it out the window. This is the movie that made me a Batman nut. I got all the toys for Christmas. I ate the cereal. Collected the cards and repeated "Who are you? "I'm Batman". It was great. The movie to me is just full of fun. Is it correct or true to the story? Not even close. But as a 7 year old not much could top it.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://derekwinnert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/466.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://derekwinnert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/466.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Jack Nicholson is amazing. Keaton was pretty damn good and the Batmobile is my favorite one ever. Burton was kept on a leash by WB and it didn't get to weird. It had just the right touch of weird. It is action packed with great one liners and iconic moments. Its just the little things that bother me about the movie. Like how no one knows who this Wayne guy is. I mean Knox had to dig through old news papers to know his parents were murdered. Joker killed them.. Ahh no he didn't. But outside of those things its just pure Batman fun with cool sets and style. The Prince music seemed like an odd choice though..</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">2.The Dark Knight Returns Pt.2(RT 94%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://kastorskorner.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DarkKnightReturnsPt2-1024x640.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://kastorskorner.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DarkKnightReturnsPt2-1024x640.png" height="400" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">TDKR pt.2 picks up where part 1 left off and kicks the pace up a notch. Again they do an outstanding job ripping from the comic and leaving almost nothing out at all. I have always wanted a direct live action take on the comic but I don't think it could match the effort that DC put in and how the vibe and feel is hit right on the head. I really don't want to give away a lot but when you put both parts together you have Batman take on two face, mutant leader, Joker and Superman all in one movie. It flows with the story and never lets you go.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn.denofgeek.us/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/article_main_half/public/batman_andjokercover.jpg?itok=xFxvfyCE" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cdn.denofgeek.us/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/article_main_half/public/batman_andjokercover.jpg?itok=xFxvfyCE" /></a></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ditto004.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dark_knight_returns.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://ditto004.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/dark_knight_returns.jpg" height="247" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You can see the comic on the bottom and the movie on the top. Nailed it.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Speaking of the Joker, Michael Emerson(LOST) does an amazing Joker. Not as loud and obnoxious as Hamill but creepier for sure. Joker holds nothing back here as the body count gets high. The final duel with Batman in the tunnel of love is tense and leaves a mark on you. In the comic nothing is said as the two have their final dance. In the movie they added in lines which add a lot to the scene. I wasn't sure about that at first but after many viewings it was the right call. This scene alone is dark and violent. I wouldn't recommend it for kids.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com//wp-content/uploads/geek/2013/01/TDKR_R2_248621.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com//wp-content/uploads/geek/2013/01/TDKR_R2_248621.jpg" height="358" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After the Joker scene you feel exhausted and its like.. THERE IS MORE? That is how the book feels. Like one epic moment after another. The battle with Superman is a good one too. I feel this main event is over shadowed by the Joker events but was an impossible moment to follow. Superman fans hate this battle but us Superman haters love it. Batman is.. Well I won't ruin it.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/51ce61b3e4b0d911b449d9f0/1358193872065/1000w/darkknight2123834718.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://static.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/51ce61b3e4b0d911b449d9f0/1358193872065/1000w/darkknight2123834718.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">To me this movie unbelievable and shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys just the Batman movies. Fan of the comic or not this SHOULD NOT BE MISSED! My only grip with the movie are the bullet dodging Batman jumps through(I know this is the norm but it goes overboard here) and Weller not seeming into a few lines as much as he should be. Oh and the stupid flying dolls. Everyone hated them in the comic as they just feel out of place in this story and they seem dumb and corny in the movie as well. But with that said. This is a masterpiece.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">1.The Dark Knight(RT 94%)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://theathleticnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/the-dark-knight-nolan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://theathleticnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/the-dark-knight-nolan.jpg" height="380" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This wasn't a hard pick.

At 18-7, there is not a lot of fear that they won't make the NCAA tournament. However, after losing 3 of their last 5 games (all by double-digits), there are certainly some doubts surrounding the tournament runner-ups from a season ago.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">Not a lot of people play<span style="color: red;"> <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/">one day fantasy leagues</a> </span>at the college level, but those who do will be quick to point out that Michigan lacks that true superstar this season. When the going gets tough, Michigan really does not have a player to turn to. Many people thought that Mitch McGary or Glenn Robinson III would take on that leadership role, but the 1st guy is injured and the 2nd guy is playing passively. Nick Stauskas has been their best player, but he has struggled recently. Caris LeVert has talent, but he does not seem to be assertive enough to take over games when it matters most.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">The Big Ten has seen quite a few road wins compared to the past few years. Maybe some people are getting a little bit too concerned about a good Wisconsin team coming into the Crisler Center and picking up a victory. The same can be said for those losses to Indiana and Iowa. However, the Wolverines could quickly go from being a legitimate Big Ten contender to just an average team with an average seed in the NCAA tournament in less than 4 weeks. They will need to Commit to the defensive end of the floor in a hurry, as they have rival Michigan State on the road this Sunday. Things get a little easier for them schedule wise after that, but a statement win on the road against the Spartans would certainly be exactly what this team needs to get back to where they were at the beginning of the season. Even without a true star, they could collectively start playing better together.<o:p></o:p></span></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/4207942922498930797/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2014/02/michigan-basketball-fan-post.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4207942922498930797";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4207942922498930797";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2014/02/michigan-basketball-fan-post.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:3;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-4783791436541171093";s:9:"published";s:29:"2014-01-25T07:19:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2014-01-25T07:19:27.506-08:00";s:5:"title";s:30:"How nik stauskas sees the hoop";s:12:"atom_content";s:435:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5vb5UnpVA0w/UuPVimE8AWI/AAAAAAAAA18/saD8FAL2_kA/s1600/nik1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5vb5UnpVA0w/UuPVimE8AWI/AAAAAAAAA18/saD8FAL2_kA/s1600/nik1.png" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">And yes he can "throw it into the Ocean".</span>";s:12:"link_replies";s:162:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/4783791436541171093/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-nik-stauskas-sees-hoop.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4783791436541171093";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4783791436541171093";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-nik-stauskas-sees-hoop.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:4;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-8875591184811461774";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-11-30T07:37:00.001-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-11-30T07:38:50.738-08:00";s:5:"title";s:15:"The Fire Rises ";s:12:"atom_content";s:2234:"Its been a sad season for MM. No MS Paints.. No nothing. 1st shift plus child makes it almost impossible. I want to apologize to my 4 readers who pay attention to the blog. The season hasn't really inspired anything... for me to want to ms paint. Saying that I have watched every play this season and still stand behind this team.<br /><br />The fire has risen for sure around Hoke's neck and this team. It just been a complete mess and putting AL aside, I have a terrible feeling that the leadership on this team isn't very good or the locker is so split with lots of younger guys that they just don't get along. I can't see how a team who likes each other could play so terrible. I've been on teams that had talent but didn't get along and the results were similar. I can only hope the guys grow in the locker room and get it together for 2014.<br /><br />Now Al. I really never call for people to be fired since I know they want to win and have families(I didn't even call to fire Rich) but Al has got to go. Its just poison now. Play action on 2 and 12 is just the tip of the iceberg. Not giving your QB a chance to check out of 11 dudes in the box because there is 2 seconds on the play call just shows me you have a lack of competence. I could go on.<br /><br />Al will be gone. Brandon IMO won't give Hoke even the chance to keep him. Brandon knows football and he knows the things he sees are just embarrassing. From the rushing numbers to the offensive looking like a deer in the head lights.Its over. Al Borges will be fired.<br /><br />Saying that...

Dark and scary. This movie will freak out any 8 year old. Melting vulture faces anyone?<br /><b>The Chipmunks Adventure-</b>The best Chipmunk cartoon in my book. Balloon race around the world gets real when the Chipmunks find out they are just moving diamonds and cash for some bitch.<br />&nbsp;<b>The Secret of NIMH-</b>Creepy movie by Don Bluth. It has very adult tones and the science lab scene is intense. Plus a sweet medallion is used to help the mom Mrs.Brisby.<br /><b>An American Tale-</b>Classic movie that is just a fun ride with a great singing mouse.<br /><b>Mr.Boogedy-</b>This was on TV in 1986 and was made by Disney. It was scary as hell but I loved it. So much in fact I broke the vhs watching it so much. Hanover became Boogedy after killing a woman who turned him down, her young son and himself. I am pretty sure this movie was the reason I slept with my parents from age 4-6.<br /><b>Big-</b>Kid becomes a man with a wish. Keeps the lights on when hes about score as a 12 year old man... Whats not to like? Not a kids movie but who cares?<br /><b>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure-</b>You get a history lesson and surfer talk all in one place. I even made the time machine out of a box and walked in our towns parade as Ted.<br /><b>Uncle Buck-</b>This guy is cooking our garbage..<br /><b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II-</b>I thought this was the best thing when I was a kid but now not so much. I was blinded by Vanilla Ice and Super Shredder.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">10.

I didn't like He-Man has a kid. There I said it. The Animation sucked, there was like no story telling and Thundercats was just better. That being said.. I loved Masters of the Universe the movie and He-Man fans will hate me in every way for this. How can you hate the show and like the movie? Yes the movie isn't winning any Oscars but it was just fun to me. I had a ton of the toys(only one who bought them I'm sure). I wanted Gwildor's key(wonder where that prop is now?).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.meangoblin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/masters-of-the-universe-dolph-lundgren-l.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.meangoblin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/masters-of-the-universe-dolph-lundgren-l.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div>Frank Langella knocked Skeletor out of the fucking park. In the same way Ledger and Jack did with Joker. Dolph does alright He-Man but is overshadowed by Frank. The story is pretty shallow since it gives you no background on how He-Man becomes He-Man and how all this shit came to be. The movie just throws you right into the action of the plot which is fun but leaves out a ton of back story.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EJrs1ZWFKag" width="480"></iframe><br />Ever since this movie I have been telling people "good journey" instead of good bye.<br /><b>COOL FACT: </b>After the credits Skeletor pops out of the water and says "I'll be back!"

Not sure how to explain it. The pacing is perfect. The acting was spot on and Dustin Hoffman was a perfect Hook. Just like in MOTU Dustin steals the show with how good of a Hook he is.

If this movie was made today Hook's "hook" would be digital I am sure. It would be just a mess.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LxnR9e7M8Vw" width="480"></iframe><br />Robin Williams does a great Peter Pan and pretty awesome watching him come back around. I used to get chills when Rufio hands over the sword to Peter when he "wakes up". Speaking of Rufio, I was shocked as a kid when he was killed. One of the coolest dudes in the movie is slayed by Hook was shocking for a 10 year old. I just showed this movie to 8-10 year olds at work and they all said "Rufio is coming back...NOW" during the Peter fight with Hook but poor Rufio never showed. They couldn't believe he was really dead.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b> David Bowie turned down the role of Hook.

It had Knight Rider like abilities. The movie even has some really dark and odd characters. From the rich boy Frances to Large Marge! It was adventure for sure.

You can can see the chain going up from under the bike. Or when he is driving on the road at night and sees all the different road signs. You can see the track they are running on. Not sure if Burton does this on purpose to add cheese or they are just bad misses.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZrzqBwuxHV8" width="480"></iframe><br />The DVD has a commentary with Pee-Wee and Burton which is really good.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b> The dinosaur rest stop has sadly been torn down</div><div><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">6.

I even loved them more as a kid when its in a shiny UFO with a ton of buttons. Its a pretty cool story for a kids movie. Kid falls into hole in the woods. Kid wakes up and walks back home to only find a different family living there. He finds out he has been missing for 8 years. His younger brother is older then him!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.towatchpile.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flight-of-the-navigator-towatchpile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.towatchpile.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flight-of-the-navigator-towatchpile.jpg" height="344" width="640" /></a></div>He goes to NASA for testing where young hot Jessica Sarah Parker helps him sneak out in this cool robot..thing. He meets Max the UFO space ship that took him on this adventure. I never owned it but rented it from the video store countless times. Like "oh nothing looks good... I'll rent FOTN". There are some really cool scenes where he learns to fly the ship, meets more aliens and the ship transforms to fly faster.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E4DzASrMZtc" width="640"></iframe><br />Pee-Wee/Paul Reubens voices Max and maybe a bit annoying to grownups but to us kids it was a great touch that made us love the movie even more. He only goes full Pee-Wee after he scans the kids brain.. So it isn't that bad. I am always hoping for a good Blu-Ray release but won't hold my breath.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b> Had a hard time finding anything really interesting so <a href="http://dinosaurdracula.com/blog/flight-of-the-navigator-toys/">here is a cool look at David's NASA room.</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">5. Never Ending Story</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.impawards.com/1984/posters/neverending_story_ver1_xlg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.impawards.com/1984/posters/neverending_story_ver1_xlg.jpg" height="640" width="416" /></a></div>I remember being at the baby sitters when I first saw this. It was amazing. Its fun, emotional and scary all at the same time. The kid actors are some of the best I've seen. Barret Oliver(Bastian) and Noah Hathaway(Atreyu) both bring out a lot of emotion making the movie so memorable.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews49/never_ending_story_blu-ray/large/12_neverending_story_blu-ray.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews49/never_ending_story_blu-ray/large/12_neverending_story_blu-ray.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div>I put the death of Artex the horse up there with Rufio from hook. I was shocked and sad. I was only about 5 or 6 when I saw it. I was also scared with that crazy ass wolf, Gmork(spelling?) chasing down Atreyu. His death is a good one and even has some blood. Pretty freaky stuff for kids. As the nothing rips through Fantasia you really wonder what could stop this thing? I really enjoyed how the movie wrapped up and had the happy ending that it did. Seeing the horse back and the bullies getting what they deserved was pretty satisfying.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.alicia-logic.com/capsimages01/tns_061Gmork.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.alicia-logic.com/capsimages01/tns_061Gmork.jpg" height="270" width="640" /></a></div>Of course there is part 2 and 3 which are just terrible. I was so geeked for 2 and I remember the pure disappointment after leaving the theater. It was cool seeing the same characters again but Jonathan Brandis(RIP) was terrible and the plot was just boring. &nbsp;3 sucks balls big time and... Ahh it has Jack Black in it? I really need to read the book. People who like the book hate on the movie. I liked it so much as a kid that I doubt that could happen.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/B3DcWtkKeIY" width="480"></iframe><br />I even did two themed Michigan Never Ending story Michigan MS Paints. One is<a href="http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2012/06/weird-wednesday-brings-us-what-really.html"> Roh's eyebrow</a> and the other is <a href="http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2010/02/oh-my-god-fetuatitus.html">Tate fly on Falcor with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #020202; font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;">"Fetuatitus"</span></a>&nbsp;which was banned from MGBLOG since I made it up.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b>Author Michael Ende was unhappy with the film and didn't want his name on the opening credits. A small credit is given to him at the end.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">4.Goonies</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cf.drafthouse.com/_uploads/galleries/23982/mondo-goonies-poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cf.drafthouse.com/_uploads/galleries/23982/mondo-goonies-poster.jpg" height="640" width="432" /></a></div>The ultimate adventure kid movie. Every kid wants to take off and go find treasure, pirates and a giant special ed friend. Its a movie that is a blast and never stops. This is another great acting kid movie where the kids sell their roles so well. Every line Chunk delivers is gold.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cf.drafthouse.com/_uploads/galleries/23982/goonies_image_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cf.drafthouse.com/_uploads/galleries/23982/goonies_image_1.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div>If this movie came out today it would be PG-13 easy. The cussing in this thing is great but it is a major reason I can't show it to the kids in my class. Back in the 1980s I don't think parents were so sensitive plus the rating system was just more lax.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pWgc8Ute2tU" width="640"></iframe><br />Some of my favorite scenes were Chunk spilling his life story at the blender, Kids breaking the dick off the statue and Chunk flagging down the car. The Nintendo games sucked but the commentary on the DVD is very good as it has pretty much everyone from the cast.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b> The pirate ship was in fact a real ship the studio built for the movie. Once the filming was done the studio tried to sell it off to anyone and everyone. They had no takers and so it was dismantled.. ):<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">3.Karate Kid</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.cinemasterpieces.com/92010a/kidsept10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.cinemasterpieces.com/92010a/kidsept10.jpg" height="640" width="436" /></a></div>I got so hooked into this movie(watched the cartoon and had the toys). I was never even in Karate but this movie made me beg my mom for lesson in which I was denied. I made my own&nbsp;bandana and Karate suit. I would watch the final fight with Daniel vs Johnny and mimic the moves and do the crane kick. I also rented the video game and hid it from my mom so she wouldn't take it back since I liked it so much.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://101tees.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/karatekid-1024x544.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://101tees.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/karatekid-1024x544.jpg" height="340" width="640" /></a></div>This movie has so many memorable lines. Wax on wax off has become a house hold phrase. One of the best is "GET EM A BODY BAG!!!!11" followed by a weasel laugh. "mercy is for the weak!" "Sweep the Leg..." I could go on all day.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film3/blu-ray_reviews51/karate_kid_blu-ray/large/large_karate_kid_blu-ray4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film3/blu-ray_reviews51/karate_kid_blu-ray/large/large_karate_kid_blu-ray4.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div>The movie grabs every kids attention since every kid has dealt with a bully at one point or another. Johnny plays the perfect bully. We have all had to fight off a Johnny in our lives so it easy for kids to get sucked into this plot. We also can't forget the fucking awesome tournament montage of "the best around". Might be one of the best of the 80s.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://basementrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/karate-kid-1984-johnny-skeleton-costumes-cobra-kai-ralph-macchio.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://basementrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/karate-kid-1984-johnny-skeleton-costumes-cobra-kai-ralph-macchio.jpg" height="354" width="640" /></a></div>When I got the dvd set(full of great interviews BTW) and watched it, I realized how much I missed as a kid since the only copy I had was a recorded version off TV. I would always pause during the commercials and then forget to hit pause again when the movie would come back on so my Karate Kid was all chopped up. Like I missed the whole soccer fight at school, lunch with his GF and the punch training. So that was a nice bonus.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/n7JhKCQnEqQ" width="640"></iframe><br />The 2nd one I thought was good. More adult tone, serious threat. 3rd one is just garbage and Ralph is like 32 years old and the acting is awful.<br /><b>COOL FACT:</b> Ralph was 23 years old and playing a 16 or 17 year old! He also got to keep the yellow car and still has it. Oh and his kids name is "Daniel".<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">2.Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.impawards.com/1991/posters/robin_hood_prince_of_thieves.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.impawards.com/1991/posters/robin_hood_prince_of_thieves.jpg" height="640" width="430" /></a></div>Some how Kevin Costner made Robin Hood a lot of fun. I am not one to like time period movies but after seeing Robin Hood at nine I was hooked. I bought almost all the toys and even had the cassette tape with all the music. I even ran around calling myself "Ryan Hood". I never did use a English accent since Kevin never bothered to.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx6iolWPsw1qdau9mo1_500.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx6iolWPsw1qdau9mo1_500.gif" height="362" width="640" /></a></div>This is another movie where the villain steals the show. Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham was amazing. He was more funny then anything. "I'll rip you're heart out with a spoon!" Really the movie is full of funny moments. All of Azeem's fish out of water moments to Azeems interactions with a blind Duncan are pretty hilarious.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://assets2.classicfm.com/2011/33/robin-hood-prince-of-thieves--1313768698-article-0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://assets2.classicfm.com/2011/33/robin-hood-prince-of-thieves--1313768698-article-0.jpg" height="308" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I am pretty sure I attempted to build a tree house due to the movie but failed. I also had a $1 store bow and arrow which didn't work very well but it was good enough.&nbsp;</div><b>COOL FACT:</b> The movie was nominated for two Razzie Awards. Worst supporting actor in Slater and Costner won for worst male lead which I don't think he is Razzie bad by any means.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">1. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Of course "Shredder's" number 1 movie as a child is Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles from 1990. When I saw the teasers and trailers for this movie I could barley contain myself. I would jump up and down at the TV and foam at the mouth. It was one of the first movies I saw on opening day. Not only did I see it on opening day I saw it three times in the first three days of its release. Every friend was calling me asking if I could watch it. It was no doubt the biggest movie release of our young lives. I would only put such movies as Ghostbusters 2, Indiana Jones TLC and BTTF 3 in the such company.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CS_11737_TeenageTurtlesOneSheet.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CS_11737_TeenageTurtlesOneSheet.jpg" height="640" width="448" /></a></div>I can still remember sitting in the theater with my mom with a turtle doll that the theater was giving to the first 100 kids. The theater was a buzz. The lights went down and you can feel every kid on the edge of their seat. Hey its foot soldiers! Oh my god there is April O' Neal! She is wearing a yellow rain coat! Then the Turtles save April and you see Raph's eyes as he watches his weapon being picked up April. He mutters "Damn".. SHOCKING! A cuss word right off the bat. Not a big one but wow. Then all you hear is Turtle chatter as they walk down &nbsp;the sewer. The theater at this point was about to burst. Then this title flashes on the screen with Leo jumping into frame!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pvJtaR-K9Sk/UeNRYR2E1QI/AAAAAAAAAzw/i-BRX-XcwhQ/s1600/tmnt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pvJtaR-K9Sk/UeNRYR2E1QI/AAAAAAAAAzw/i-BRX-XcwhQ/s640/tmnt.jpg" height="302" width="640" /></a></div>The theater goes fucking nuts! Kids screaming and cheering. I still haven't experienced anything like that at a movie since. It was like TMNT had hit its peak and we couldn't get enough.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-62Pm2EH7Zwg/TjwEy8Lx5HI/AAAAAAAABn8/ZiYV87WdB5s/s1600/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-62Pm2EH7Zwg/TjwEy8Lx5HI/AAAAAAAABn8/ZiYV87WdB5s/s640/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div>After reading the comic I will say this movie does a pretty damn good job of sticking to elements in the comic. It isn't spot on(April is still a reporter here and no Baxter Stockmen) but it hits the tone pretty well. I remember hearing how pissed parents were at the dark tone and language in the movie but it was really just being faithful to the source the best it could while maintaining a PG rating. I guess showing kids smoking,drinking and playing a NARC arcade was a bit much but they need to show the kind of kids the Shredder attracts.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.doblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/teenageturtles5348.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.doblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/teenageturtles5348.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a></div>Jim Hanson knocked it out of the park again with the turtle suits. The faces moved great, they were believable and the actors could still do all the ninja work without any hold ups. In part 2 and 3 the suits got worse and worse. In 3 they look almost comical they are so bad.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Jim_Henson_and_Ninja_Turtles_1990.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Jim_Henson_and_Ninja_Turtles_1990.jpeg" height="190" width="320" /></a></div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UPxL4lkkIyw" width="640"></iframe><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Five Top Scenes</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">5.Splinters heart to heart with Raphael</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cmM_KZB4NOw/UetMIE4_6kI/AAAAAAAAAz8/QACh-OfMp_U/s1600/top5tmtn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cmM_KZB4NOw/UetMIE4_6kI/AAAAAAAAAz8/QACh-OfMp_U/s640/top5tmtn.jpg" height="296" width="640" /></a></div>Raph comes home after watching "Critters" at the theater and his rough run in with Casey Jones and he is no mood to chat but Splinter isn't having it. Its a good heart felt scene that shows the father like connection. He also says "hey we know you are like the Lebron James of TMNT but your anger holds you back". Something like that.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">4.When April meets the Turtles/Splinters talk with Daniel</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WZU4KdAHzZ0/UetQVz3dDbI/AAAAAAAAA0M/UUTQgzKKNaw/s1600/top5tmtn2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WZU4KdAHzZ0/UetQVz3dDbI/AAAAAAAAA0M/UUTQgzKKNaw/s640/top5tmtn2.jpg" height="308" width="640" /></a></div>This scene does a good job of selling the origin of the turtles without it being the whole movie. When I was a kid I thought the story was all wrong here. But like a lot of kids we had no idea that the Turtles were born in comics. In the movie you hear that Splinters master Hamato Yoshi and Oroku Saki were fighting over this babe named Tang Shen but she only loved Yoshi and so Saki killed them both and left Splinter without his master(and the rat scarred his face so he hides it). Comic goes a little deeper with that. Yoshi and a man named Oroku Nagi were apart the most feared assassins group in Japan called the Foot Clan(origin of the foot). Nagi loved Shen but she only loved Yoshi. When Yoshi comes home to find Nagi beating Shen within a inch of her life "Yoshi's world vanished in a red haze". Yoshi ends up beating Nogi to death.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130720_232021_zps252a5f9f.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130720_232021_zps252a5f9f.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></div>Since Yoshi killed another clan member he was to end his own life or run from Japan. So Yoshi and Shen run to NYC. Nogi's younger brother Oroku Saki who was 7 at the time(intense 7 year old) vowed Vengeance on Yoshi. Over time Saki became the best foot clan member and was even better then his teachers. Saki was sent to NYC to start the Foot on US soil. Saki also knew that his revenge would come full circle now. Once in the USA he became the Shredder(no reason is given to why he goes with Shredder) and went to Yoshi's home and held his wife until Yoshi came home. Once home he killed Tang Shen in front of Yoshi and then killed Yoshi as well. The movie just cut some of the fat and saw no reason for Nagi. Either way you go its some pretty edgy shit for a kids movie. The flash backs in the movie are all grainy and dark. You still see Yoshi and Shen murdered. Its real heavy stuff and can't believe it wasn't cut or pushed to a PG-13 but god damn its good and faithful.<br /><br />Now the rest of the movie just does it own thing. Splinter is never captured by the Shredder and in the comic its pretty clear the Turtles are used for his revenge on Shredder. But the movie stays true to the tone and that counts for something.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">3.April's apartment fight</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ic_o1r1vwKQ/UetkdxItsxI/AAAAAAAAA0c/6FBHW6_qR9I/s1600/top5tmtn3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ic_o1r1vwKQ/UetkdxItsxI/AAAAAAAAA0c/6FBHW6_qR9I/s640/top5tmtn3.jpg" height="256" width="640" /></a></div>This was always one of my favorite parts of the movie. Raph is almost beaten to death and the turtles have this long fight that leads to the basement where Casey Jones shows up to help kick some ass. The Turtles also struggle at times and the foot get their shots in which makes it feel different because in the cartoon the foot are about as dangerous as a infant to the turtles. They never got punches in. The turtles have to retreat which is also just bizarre when they never had to. My only complaint is that at times in can venture off with "funny" stuff during the fight when its a pretty serious situation.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">2.Shredder's Entrance</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2013/02/tmnt13.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2013/02/tmnt13.jpg" height="358" width="640" /></a></div>At this point all we have of the Shredder is his voice so they do a good job of building this moment up. You also gotta love the music and the wrap around camera shot. The scene builds him up as one big bad mother fucker. There isn't a whole lot to say about the scene other then its just gives you chills.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">1.Final Fight</span><br />I loved this final act as a kid and I love it even more after reading the comic. A lot of elements are there. Shredder on a building taking on the Turtles to the death(or so we think). The turtles are of course are cocky at this point and Shredder wipes the floor with them one at a time.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8nBRNRg7wKo/Uet_x8uR9sI/AAAAAAAAA0s/ykLEjUXvoY4/s1600/top5tmtn4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8nBRNRg7wKo/Uet_x8uR9sI/AAAAAAAAA0s/ykLEjUXvoY4/s640/top5tmtn4.jpg" height="260" width="640" /></a></div>Shredder then pokes the bear a bit by hinting at Splinter possibly being dead. All of a sudden the jokes are over. Every Turtle giving their best shot at Shredder. Leo gets the best shots in as he slices Shredders arm but Leo loses his cool and gets owned by the Shredder and is put on his back with a spear at his neck. Splinter shows up to save the day and Shredder is thrown off a building and smashed in a garbage truck(Casey does "whoops" as he pulls the leaver... Like no big deal...JUST MURDERING)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D33WqGWg-Ls/UeuAYGKvXfI/AAAAAAAAA00/zfSrFRlRVQs/s1600/top5tmtn5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D33WqGWg-Ls/UeuAYGKvXfI/AAAAAAAAA00/zfSrFRlRVQs/s640/top5tmtn5.jpg" height="284" width="640" /></a></div>Now in the comic, Shredder gets some shots in but the Turtles really mess him up. He is stabbed, catches a few throwing stars and once defeated is told to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku">SEPPUKU</a> for honor. Yes it fucked up and awesome all at the same time.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130721_015752_zps6858432a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130721_015752_zps6858432a.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></div>While the movie isn't as gory or follow everything to heart it still feels like a great adaptation to the comic and for a PG "kids" movie it pushes the envelop. As a kid it was the best thing I've seen since Ghostbusters and watched it everyday for about a month once I got my VHS copy. In fact I still have a sealed VHS copy that I found in a bargain bin for 50 cents.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130721_015827_zpsa2dfb3dc.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/20130721_015827_zpsa2dfb3dc.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div>I hope one day a proper Blu-ray is released that is cleaned up and with some extras for the fans. The current BR is just terrible. Tons of grain and hasn't be touched at all. The latest movie coming out from Michael Bay sounds like a joke. Call me a hater but I am not at all looking forward to it. I expect pure shit with Meagan Fox's bizarre thumbs mixed in. Bay might find a way to to top the giant dump that was Turtles 3 but I doubt it.<br /><br />Thanks for reliving my movie childhood!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:162:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/1285067539396463631/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/07/my-top-10-childhood-movies.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/1285067539396463631";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/1285067539396463631";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/07/my-top-10-childhood-movies.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:6;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-2330853523100454611";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-06-13T11:08:00.001-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-06-13T11:08:36.716-07:00";s:5:"title";s:33:"Mini Scouting Report:Devin Booker";s:12:"atom_content";s:4376:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2013/0305/rn_devinbooker_ms_576.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2013/0305/rn_devinbooker_ms_576.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Last weekend I got a chance to watch Devin Book play three games at the GRCC team camp. Take this report with the smallest grains of salt since it was only three games.<br /><br />Let me just say the kids size is great. He looked a legit 6'4 and has room to grow. I could easily see his frame finish at 6'5-6'6. He looks the part of a major 5 star prospect. He came late to the event. The competition was alright with East Kentwood(huge school) and some other nice size schools there.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Offense</span><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">+</span></b>He is just smooth. Handling the ball is just easy for him. Has a great stride when he runs. Can get to the hoop in very few dribbles.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>He pull up going to his right was great. He seemed most comfortable in his shot going right. Never saw him try and go to left and pull up.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Vision was outstanding. Found people open all day. Was never selfish. His basketball IQ was great that he would never take a terrible shot and hit the open man. A lot of great high school players take bad shots since they think there always the best option. Even when a player is open. Booker didn't show any of that. He just made the right basketball play.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Went to the post, didn't have the dominate the ball. Would also play off the wing. Willing to play anywhere on the court.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>-</b></span>Standing jump shot. Didn't make a lot of three balls. Seems like a better shooter off the dribble.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>-</b></span>Post game. He would be in the short corner or in the high post and couldn't convert. BUT I will say he made great back to the basket moves to get a good look. Just couldn't convert(not that he would post up in a coach B system).<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>-</b></span>Shoot more. At times he would pass up open looks to drive or find others. Had a Lebron feeling to him that he would rather get others going first. Not always a bad thing but at times its a great open look. Not sure his shot is there yet and just goes back to him wanting to slash more because of it.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Defense</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Showed great lateral quickness on smaller players. There was a smaller PG that talked junk to him and all of a sudden he went into lock down mode. The kid pretty much couldn't dribble with out losing it and he was a decent senior PG. He also helped on defense by taking a few shots out of the air on layups. He seem to take pride in defense. He wasn't just waiting to get back to the offensive side.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>-</b></span>A big kid had his way in the post a few times on him but had a lot of weight on him. I doubt that would happen a whole lot in the B10.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Highlights</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Windmill dunk with ease.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Beat a kid back on defense who had a free layup to only wipe it out into the stands(at a summer camp..Shows he hates to lose)<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>+</b></span>Picked a pocket for a easy two handed slam.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Lows</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>-</b></span>Talked to much crap for my liking. When he made a great play he made sure to let the defender know about it. Yes you will be playing at Duke or Michigan next year. That kid will be taking Math 101 at GRCC.. You should score. He show great confidence which is good but would cross the line at times for no reason.<br /><br />He looks like an elite guy. He will be a huge get for Michigan if they can reel him in. Lets hope they do. He spent most his free time with Drake Harris if that means anything.";s:12:"link_replies";s:168:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/2330853523100454611/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/06/mini-scouting-reportdevin-booker.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2330853523100454611";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2330853523100454611";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/06/mini-scouting-reportdevin-booker.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:7;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-519245546523130666";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-05-09T10:43:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-05-09T10:44:32.318-07:00";s:5:"title";s:38:"MICHIGAN CRAP YOU WOULDN'T BUY ON EBAY";s:12:"atom_content";s:4964:"Not all Michigan items are pretty.

This move might be bad for those students who enjoy sleeping in for early games, but it should make the stadium crazier than ever.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In 2012, there was a growing trend of unused student tickets creating empty pockets in the section. For the largest stadium in the country, that was simply not a good look. There was an average of over 5000 unused student tickets throughout the 2012 season, including 3500 for the marquee home game of the year (Michigan State).</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The move might be new for Michigan, but it is certainly not new to other major programs. Michigan State, Penn State, Wisconsin and Nebraska in the Big Ten already use this format with student seating, and it has mostly been a positive experience for them. It allows groups of students to simply show up together and sit together. The previous setup meant groups of people would have to decide at the start of the season.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With this move, obviously that means for some of the more marquee matchups, there will be camping out to get the best seats available. The logistics of that are still being worked out, but the University and the city of Ann Arbor do not foresee it as being a huge issue. Despite the sale numbers being great, Michigan is hoping the move will make the Big House appear even bigger to opposing fans. Packing the stadium and having the students as close to the action as possible will make for a slightly more intimidating look as they battle for Big Ten titles.</span></div><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To draft Michigan players to your <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D%3C/span"><a href="https://www.fanduel.com/fantasy-football" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://www.fanduel.com/<wbr></wbr>fantasy-football</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">?&gt;fantasy football 2013<a href=""> lineup click on the link.</a></span></a></span></b>";s:12:"link_replies";s:174:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/2453717456201867656/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/05/guest-post-michigan-student-section-is.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2453717456201867656";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2453717456201867656";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/05/guest-post-michigan-student-section-is.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:9;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-6549635028191283683";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-05-04T09:55:00.001-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-05-04T09:55:27.130-07:00";s:5:"title";s:16:"Rent a House Yo ";s:12:"atom_content";s:715:"Midnight Maize and <a href="http://universityfootballrentals.com/">University Football Rentals</a> are teaming up to give you a discount on a house to rent for the football season in Ann Arbor.

I coach and played. I now&nbsp;officiate.&nbsp; I could go on and on. So that makes me an expert on the 2-3 zone.<br /><br />We are lucky enough to get a little preview of this Final Four match up back in 2011 when Michigan played Cuse in the Legends Classic. Now the 2011 Michigan team is in no way as good as the 2013 team but not far off.<br /><br />The basics are to keep the ball moving. Burke can't pound the air out of the rock for 10 and 15 secs of a&nbsp;position. Attack the creases(looking at you THJ,GR3 and Burke) and find soft spots in the zone. Soft spots can be found all over the court. Moving the ball with a good flow will open them all up. A "stuck" ball will not.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Soft spots in the short corner</span><br />This is where Burke must find Mcgary, Morgan, GR3 and Horford's when the soft spot in the zone opens up in the short corner. Ok pictures.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Pab1VJidwg4/UV4xer7eNZI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/7JrAy5gGOqc/s1600/cuse1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="308" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Pab1VJidwg4/UV4xer7eNZI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/7JrAy5gGOqc/s640/cuse1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-53RVtPr0CvI/UV4zOdFOcEI/AAAAAAAAAyY/xRirKOK2GIU/s1600/cuse2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="308" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-53RVtPr0CvI/UV4zOdFOcEI/AAAAAAAAAyY/xRirKOK2GIU/s640/cuse2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Morgan is standing in the short corner. If one thing Morris has on Burke is his great court vision. He already can see Morgan creeping in the short corner. He looks out to his right which looks off the center Mello and opens a crease for a pretty pass which Morgan finishes for 2. Now the pass was a bit high which caused Morgan to use a up and under but the play was made. Also with Novak close to the short corner that means his man won't sag off a lot since he can knock down threes. That will be Nik on Saturday. Michigan has to get its fair share of easy buckets from the short corner.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Soft Spots in the Corners</span><br />Alright Nik this is you buddy.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KKW_cv_6_xI/UV43fuHPraI/AAAAAAAAAyw/P4YaNvuXwtY/s1600/cuse4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KKW_cv_6_xI/UV43fuHPraI/AAAAAAAAAyw/P4YaNvuXwtY/s640/cuse4.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bxn3vK7ZPFw/UV42afUM31I/AAAAAAAAAyo/D2jLLKP8Umk/s1600/cuse3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bxn3vK7ZPFw/UV42afUM31I/AAAAAAAAAyo/D2jLLKP8Umk/s640/cuse3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>I suspect Beilein will move Nik all over and even throw him in the middle which is a great idea. It is harder to keep track of shooters in the zone if you are not just planting them on wings and having them wait for kicks. Here Evan starts in middle. The ball swings right and he moves out to the corner and Morgan slides to the cuse bench side. This moves the zone which gives Morris his crease to attack. The defense closes on Morris and the ball is kicked to the corner for a easy three for Evan. Open shots will be had when Burke attacks. Michigan just has to make them.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Soft Spot in the Middle</span><br />THJ needs to be chucking less here and be more of a play maker.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--RXL6JnpKEU/UV46x_kQO2I/AAAAAAAAAy8/iRVHtFQ9n64/s1600/cuse5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--RXL6JnpKEU/UV46x_kQO2I/AAAAAAAAAy8/iRVHtFQ9n64/s640/cuse5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>When the ball get to the high elbow or the "middle" the zone is broke. Options&nbsp;galore&nbsp;happen. You have the shot, the dump down to the short corner and the drive and kick for a 3. Now here Evan rushes the shot and misses. He has Morgan wide open for the dump or he can put the ball on the floor and suck the defense in even more setting up Stu(not the best idea since he wasn't that skilled at doing such things). The reason the zone works even after you break it is because the players are given so many options they don't always take the right one or they turn it over. THJ will be the main man here and maybe Mitch too. THJ can't just chuck the ball at the hoop cause hes open for one split second. Him getting to the rack would be a great option which gets him to the foul line and gets open looks for his team. I can't stress it enough that getting the ball in the middle is only half the battle. Once there you will need be quick and smart. Dumb teams like Marquette get killed since they DERP once the ball enters the high posts.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">A few notes on this 2011 game</span><br />-Michigan lacks the talent Cuse has but Beilein's X and O zone break keeps this game close.<br />-Michigan got a good number of offensive rebs. GO GET EM MITCH.<br />-THJ was THJ. Bad shot&nbsp;selection, quick shots in the middle of the zone.<br />-Morris found Morgan countless times in the short corner. Burke must do the same.<br />-Like they did with Evan, moving Nik all over the court in the zone will be key.<br />-The corners were open a lot in this game. Nik should be drooling.<br />-Jordan Morgan looks more&nbsp;confident&nbsp;in this game then he has all season in 2013. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">A few notes on the 2013 game</span><br />-Burke has to move the ball. The only dribbling that is needed will be for hitting creases.<br />-Team basketball is key.<br />-Be smart when you break the zone. Looking at you Tim.<br />-Feast on the short corner Mitch and GR3.<br />-Turnovers will happen and happen early.<br />-If the shots fall the zone will become less aggressive. You have won the war.<br />-THJ is due. That is all I will say.<br /><br />Michigan struggled for a bit with the&nbsp;Florida's&nbsp;zone but found comfort after about 5 mins of it. That is how zones are. Your brain settles in after seeing it move&nbsp;position&nbsp;after&nbsp;position&nbsp; You know the movements of the defense. After Michigan settles in the turnovers will become less and things should open up a lot. This is why when I coach I would never use it full time. Its great for a change of pace or "curve ball" but after the offense settles in... It can be hard to get defensive stops. I won't even get into rebounding.<br /><br />Michigan has all the tools to "get nuts" on this thing but they will need to be smart, quick and shoot decent. Slow and dumb could cause Michigan to lose. I like our chances if Burke is finding his bros. Remember Bros before shots vs a Zone Trey.

You wouldn't have know that he had been signing for the last 5 hours. He was really great to all the fans. It was at Legends Card Shop. This was much better then fan day since you had a number and could roam and be a Mall Rat for the day. It did cost money but I like getting my crappy MS Paints signed.

I will no longer be a 3rd shift who blogs once in a while. I will no longer walk around like a zombie. I will&nbsp;actually&nbsp;be me for once and not some lazy pathetic over tired slob. I will no longer not like me. I haven't liked me in some time. Working 3rds can&nbsp;mentally&nbsp;break you down and physically turn you into a pile ooze.<br /><br />I have&nbsp;accepted&nbsp;a new job within the company I work for working with&nbsp;academics&nbsp;and kids. I will now be a normal human who works 7 am to 3 pm and sleep in the same bed as my wife for 7 days a week. I am pretty excited about this. Its been six long years of 10:30 pm to 9 am. Its finally over and I can't soak it in enough.<br />People every night take for granted sleeping in their own bed. I got to sleep in my own bed 3 nights a week. That is 156 days a year. Think about that. That is&nbsp;absurd. It makes you worthless pretty much everyday.<br /><br />I was keeping up fine until my son was born then things changed... My wife goes to school full time so I would come home and have to watch him all day after staying up all night. Not only was this terrible for me and my well being but I was a useless dad who turned the TV on and tried not to fall a sleep as my son played. This is a big reason I stopped posting on MM so much. I couldn't focus on writing anything at night since my vision would just blur and double as I would struggle to stay awake. Writing for me is just like reading a book. It relaxes me and puts me out. So unless I got some extra sleep or I was feeling better then norm I wasn't going to write anything. Here was my normal day after my 3 days off. Wake at 8:00 am when my son did. Watch him all day until my wife got home at 6 pm. Do family and dinner and go to work at 10:30 pm. We have meetings on the following day so I have to stay until 11 am... So now I am at about 27 hour awake. I would go home and watch my son until my wife got home around 5 pm and maybe 4 pm if I am lucky. So that is about 32-34 hours awake straight. I would then sleep from 5 pm to 10 pm and go back to work and repeat. It was killing me. And it almost did&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;times. I have lost count how many times I have dozed off while driving and almost gotten into an&nbsp;accident. I have been very lucky. I have taken 15 min power naps at many gas stations just to make it home.<br /><br />Its 3:35 am right now and I have been up since 8 am.. Oh and I have a meeting until 11 am tomorrow. This is the last week of killing my brain.<br /><br />So many people would say, how do you do it? It crazy how you just like hit this wall and you can't keep your head up but then out of no where you will break through the wall and have a new burst for an hour. When I had Season tickets last season I would head to Ann Arbor on no sleep right after work. I would be having a really hard time staying awake but once I got on US-23 I would get a rush of energy as I could feel the Big House calling me. I only went to a few games and sold the rest since I couldn't pass up the one day I could just go home and go to sleep for 10 hours(I won't get into day sleeping, its sucks). I watched most my games on DVR.<br /><br />My body? Its goo. I started at 195 lbs and no I am a hefty 220 lbs. At 6'2 it isn't the end of the world but I am not happy with it. I eat so much crap at night to stay awake. My mind? A mess. I can't remember anything anymore. You sit around all alone at night and wonder what you are dying from this week. Worry about this or that. Did I just see a figure out the window? A person? No I am just dozing off again. Seeing things. Wait what did I hear? A child sneaking out? Nope just me nodding off and hitting the remote control on the ground. Nothing seems real and your a step slow with every thought.<br /><br />I didn't want my son seeing his dad sleep his days away and not being able to be there for special moments. If I hadn't knocked this interview out of the park I'm not sure what I would have done. With my wife a full time slave of school and the hospital(intern) I could never walk away. But I did own that interview and now I can lead a normal life. I now can help kids at work while they are awake and that is a good feeling. I didn't mean to ramble this long post out but its been a long time coming. 3rd shifters will never get their due since its hard to&nbsp;imagine&nbsp;the torture they go through unless you do it. I have no idea if this changes anything with my blog that gets a few ebay posts and MS paints here and there. My&nbsp;motivation&nbsp;will be back. That I can say... So I have no idea. Not like I have a ton of readers but I do enjoy the people that do read.<br /><br />I start Monday. I am free of this torture. My mind and body will be back. I can now watch Michigan Football and Basketball live. Life is good.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_4P5Ts-yjJw/UThdaeo5hOI/AAAAAAAAAwM/bhWundrgCc0/s1600/bannershreds.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="144" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_4P5Ts-yjJw/UThdaeo5hOI/AAAAAAAAAwM/bhWundrgCc0/s640/bannershreds.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:164:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/4950770241524856880/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/03/waking-up-from-six-year-haze.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4950770241524856880";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/4950770241524856880";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2013/03/waking-up-from-six-year-haze.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:14;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-4110574004412561995";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-02-08T02:48:00.001-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-02-08T02:51:24.270-08:00";s:5:"title";s:48:"Big Ten Basketball Crap you wouldn't buy on Ebay";s:12:"atom_content";s:7559:"I give you the single<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Michigan-State-Spartans-Sweater-Cardigan-Womens-M-Cheer-Mens-Basketball-Football-/290857425348?pt=US_NCAA_Fan_Shop&amp;hash=item43b87419c4"> most terrible cardigan ever knitted in history of man..</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Michigan-State-Spartans-Sweater-Cardigan-Womens-M-Cheer-Mens-Basketball-Football-/00/s/MTI4OVgxNjAw/z/Q9AAAOxyhs9RDtnN/$(KGrHqJHJBQFEHMPqGRTBRDtnM6i2w~~60_57.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="514" src="http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Michigan-State-Spartans-Sweater-Cardigan-Womens-M-Cheer-Mens-Basketball-Football-/00/s/MTI4OVgxNjAw/z/Q9AAAOxyhs9RDtnN/$(KGrHqJHJBQFEHMPqGRTBRDtnM6i2w~~60_57.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Michigan-State-Spartans-Sweater-Cardigan-Womens-M-Cheer-Mens-Basketball-Football-/00/s/MTI3NFgxNjAw/z/-WUAAOxynhFRDtns/$T2eC16JHJHEE9ny2p6YbBRDtnrGSjw~~60_57.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="507" src="http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Michigan-State-Spartans-Sweater-Cardigan-Womens-M-Cheer-Mens-Basketball-Football-/00/s/MTI3NFgxNjAw/z/-WUAAOxynhFRDtns/$T2eC16JHJHEE9ny2p6YbBRDtnrGSjw~~60_57.JPG" width="640" /></a></div>I mean wow.

Our home has been helping abused and neglected youth in Grand Rapids for over 100+ years!</div><br />In the past some great Michigan fans and Grads have donated to our home through this blog. In the past people have donated Michigan T-shirts, Basketball Tickets, Football tickets and even money for Hot Dogs at the games. Each time we go to a Michigan event the kids have a blast. Some even mention when they leave that it was their favorite day at St.Johns. Right now we have some big Michigan fans in the house(no State! yay!).<br /><br />So this Christmas we are looking for any donation to a Basketball game. Does not matter what the game. Hoping for at least 3 tickets together. Then we could take one staff and two boys. We have 9 boys total but I know getting that many together is a stretch. So we will take any number of tickets that are offered. If I get more then one offer then I will try and see if any other homes would like them(we have 5 other houses on campus)<br /><br />I am also looking for a old NES or SNES for the boys. I think they would really have a good time with some classic games. Our xbox broke and haven't had the money to replace it so I have been wanting to find something that could fill some time during the winter that won't cost $100+. If anyone has a old NES or SNES with some games laying around they don't want then the boys would really love it.

And that's Denard.</span></i><br /><br />It has been a fun 4 years with Denard. I was on hand to witness his first touch of the football that went BOOM!<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hL9Dl0-SvpU" width="480"></iframe><br />During the 2009 season it seemed like there was no way you would ever sling the ball at Michigan on a every down basis. 2010 came and UCONN visited the Big House and the rumors were proven true from practice reports...<i> Denard Robinson was the man for his time and place</i>.&nbsp;Deanrd had defenses kneeling before him week after week and he was kneeling on them. Its pretty scary to think what his stats would have looked like under RR but this is football and changes were made.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4gTqNkIJOR8/UKYfoy94p1I/AAAAAAAAAu0/DRpCyAR7rSM/s1600/drtimeandplace4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4gTqNkIJOR8/UKYfoy94p1I/AAAAAAAAAu0/DRpCyAR7rSM/s1600/drtimeandplace4.png" height="292" width="400" /></a></div><br />The changes kept Robinson from ever putting up Heisman numbers and asked him to make throws he can't always make but he did it all for Michigan and his team. Many players who had the success that Denard did in 2010 would have jet for the Oregon's of the world. He didn't since Michigan was always first to him.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F-0ca19rAuQ/UKYgOU8QhoI/AAAAAAAAAu8/EF5--X7dNIo/s1600/drtimeandplace5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F-0ca19rAuQ/UKYgOU8QhoI/AAAAAAAAAu8/EF5--X7dNIo/s1600/drtimeandplace5.png" height="292" width="400" /></a></div><br />Its a true sadness that the smile of the program for the last 4 years may not get to lead Michigan to victory on Saturday. The nerve injury in his elbow could rob him of that moment and the Pat White rushing record. I don't want to get into that because then I will cry all over my keyboard.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nqoLhTn6Pro/UKYeep7PLvI/AAAAAAAAAuc/FGGe6O-zpRk/s1600/drtimeandplace1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nqoLhTn6Pro/UKYeep7PLvI/AAAAAAAAAuc/FGGe6O-zpRk/s1600/drtimeandplace1.png" height="292" width="400" /></a></div><br />I can't think of to many players who have had this kind of impact on Michigan football. He is a true special talent and seeing him hit the banner one last time will have me fighting tears because I am happy for him and because I am selfish and don't want this to end. Thanks Denard for all the memories and I had such a great time making Deanrd MS Paints. Here is what Denard&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;in MS Paint form over the years. Enjoy.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/bttfcopy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/bttfcopy.jpg" height="388" width="640" /></a></div>The first Deanrd MS Paint.

Ours on the Technodrome needs a firmware update that Krang hasn't gotten to yet . It allows you to jump to close "timelines" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)">parallel universe</a>". I jumped a few lines over(not to far) to see how Michigan was doing and to find out I tracked down myself to get the&nbsp;Answers. We will just call him <span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX</span>.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> So did Michigan lose to Nebraska and did Denard hurt his elbow? Or was it something else he hurt?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX</span><span style="color: #6fa8dc;">:</span> No, Michigan didn't even play Nebraska.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> Huh?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX: </span>Nebraska isn't in the Big 14. Michigan played Indiana and it was a tight game vs the winner of the last four big 14 championships but Michigan got past the&nbsp;Hoosiers 28 to 23.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> Wait Indiana has won the last four Big 10 or errr Big 14 Championships?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> Yeah they have had a program of football&nbsp;excellence&nbsp;for years.... So Michigan is 5-0 after beating on the&nbsp;Minnesota&nbsp;Golden Retrievers.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> What the Golden Retrievers? I only went a few lines over and your world is nothing like mine. Does Denard even play for Michigan?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX: </span>Oh yeah he plays for Michigan and did hurt a nerve in his leg vs Indiana so he has throw a lot the last few games and has shown to be pretty good at it. Our&nbsp;offensives&nbsp;coordinator Mike Leach has held off on his Air raid offense due to Denard not being much of a pure passer but had to unleash it since he has lost some speed with the nerve injury. He's been great. He threw five TDs vs the Retrievers and four vs Indiana. Michigan is looking like a lock for the Big 14 championship game. The other&nbsp;division is a bit tighter but I am guessing Central Michigan comes out of the&nbsp;Papa Jims Pizza&nbsp;Division.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> ..................<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> ok ok so Mike Leach was hired? Where is Al Borges?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> I think he is OC for North Texas. He has them doing very well. He is known for calling bubble screens all the time.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> Unbelievable...<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> So... Is Northwestern any good?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX: </span>Yeah they won the Big 14 before Indiana took over. They had the Heisman last year with Dan Persa. They took a step back after Persa left. Michigan should be able to handle them. Michigan had one of the best running attacks in the nation with Deanrd, Fitz and Austin White. With Denard hurt Michigan will just pound them on the ground with Fitz and White unless NW finds a way to shut it down like Indiana and Minnesota did.<br /><br /><b>Shredder: </b>You couldn't write this stuff.<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> Huh?<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> Nothing, throw me some info on things that have nothing to do with football.<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> Hmmm Everyone uses Windows Phones.<br /><br /><b>Shredder: </b>What about Apple?<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> Apple? They are about to shut down. They are finished. They tried to enter and Toaster&nbsp;business&nbsp;and failed.<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> Also Burger King owns almost everything. They own ESPPN and Disney.<br /><br /><b>Shredder:</b> Well that&nbsp;officially&nbsp;makes me want to get back to my own timeline. Thanks for the time "other" Shredder.<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">ShredderX:</span> No problem. Good Journey.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />So as you can see with just a few jumps of the timelines Michigan is in the drivers seat for the Big 10..ahhhh Big 14 title game. Anytime this timeline's Michigan team frustrates you... Remember there is this one that just beat on power house Indiana in another timeline and is thriving under OC Mike Leach.

I am personally sick and tired of all the bad ink we are getting, and it is really time to put an end to it. Yeah, I got an OWI, so what! It's over, and everyone now knows about it. It's not like 300 other students on this campus haven't gotten one, yet the names of those people are not put on the front page of the Exponent followed up three months later by a headline on the back page of the Sports section. I know all those people putting the paper together don't have anything better to write about, and I am not mad at them for that. I am mad because they continously are publishing articles that make us look so bad. If I am not mistaken, you guys go to Purdue too and I thought you would have a little more respect for your fellow classmates and the people who bring millions of dollars into this university year after year. So to all of my basketball players, football players, soccer girls, softball girls, wrestlers, cross country, track and field guys and girls, divers, golfers, tennis girls and guys, volleyball girls and baseball players, forget what ya heard.

We some how hope to incorporate the Arby cowboy hat with the Block M. The endzones will be Dunkin' Donuts and the other will be Summers Eve Hail &nbsp;to the V. We felt that we need a ladies presence as one of our core sponsors. The 25 yards lines will also be special as they will be&nbsp;sponsored by Sex Panther Cologne and Cyberdyne Systems Corporation . Then our other sponsorship around the field will be Pizza Plant, S-Smart, I got worms, Spatula City and Holly Star Bowling Lanes. This is a exciting time for the Michigan Brand and we hope to maybe add some more sponsors in the future. Maybe a special sponsor patch on the uniforms.&nbsp;</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M0dPCjEQqnA/T__4eR1yevI/AAAAAAAAAsY/KKugrFPwZ0k/s1600/newfieldrightsideup.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="264" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M0dPCjEQqnA/T__4eR1yevI/AAAAAAAAAsY/KKugrFPwZ0k/s640/newfieldrightsideup.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzaQjX_OCaA/T__5CF8CeWI/AAAAAAAAAsg/Yy8jQqLHB9Y/s1600/newfieldrightsidedown.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="264" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzaQjX_OCaA/T__5CF8CeWI/AAAAAAAAAsg/Yy8jQqLHB9Y/s640/newfieldrightsidedown.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"></blockquote>";s:12:"link_replies";s:175:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/6324726448784341811/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2012/07/dave-brandon-announces-new-field-design.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/6324726448784341811";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/6324726448784341811";s:4:"link";s:86:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2012/07/dave-brandon-announces-new-field-design.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:24;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538.post-2504175823133794572";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-07-09T19:22:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-07-09T19:22:20.091-07:00";s:5:"title";s:22:"Just Say No to NCAA 13";s:12:"atom_content";s:8497:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F7UqxAXXht4/T_uQB7AJXyI/AAAAAAAAAsM/i-WKvmQ2bvc/s1600/stinks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="436" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F7UqxAXXht4/T_uQB7AJXyI/AAAAAAAAAsM/i-WKvmQ2bvc/s640/stinks.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />I always keep my eye on the NCAA series. Hoping that god proves that he exists and the game is everything it should be. I still play NCAA 06 since it was the last great game. Spring games, SI covers, players who are ineligible players. Solid game play. No idiot defenses. Offensive AI that can challenege you. I recommend everyone pick it up for like a buck(it does not play well on the 360, use PS2 or XBOX).<br /><br />Well as of 2012 there is still no God. Chris over at operation sports delivered the<a href="http://www.operationsports.com/MMChrisS/blog/19079-two-full-days-in-my-early-pre-review-thoughts-on-ncaa-13/"> bad news with terrible bed side manner</a>..<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #393939; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: -webkit-left;">Really a lot of the same bugs are back from prior years.

Plus there is no way to really keep track of what else is going on within Dynasty mode, I don't know...to me Dynasty mode has tried something really ambitious here but the design of the whole mode doesn't fit what the developers said they wanted to do. It's impossible to know what happened during the week without actually checking things out and sometimes that's really hard to do as a lot of what you want is buried in the menus. The whole presenting Saturday's as a storyline is cool in theory (it was one of my top wishes for this year's game) -- but it needs to be done differently. A complete revamp of the mode is necessary -- at least the menus -- to achieve this.</li><li>Wayyyy too much dead space with commentary, the presentation as a whole is just not up to par with it's peers in our genre although it is better than last year.</li><li>Seriously, it's time to rethink defense. It's just boring and doesn't work how real football defense is played. On top of that, there's nothing to do and it feels just put in -- especially now after a decade of the same old boring thing.</li><li>Apparently, Brent Venables taught the NCAA Football 13 team all about safety play because receivers run right past them into the open field. Vertical routes with fast receivers are nothing but money, it's horrendous.</li><li>What is NCAA Football 13 simulating on the field? Seriously. SOMEONE FIGURE THIS OUT! Are you watching a TV broadcast? A cinematic presentation of college football? Are you watching it as if you were playing in the stadium? You CAN NOT do all three. All of the great games in our genre pick a style and mimick it and their presentations are much better than NCAA's. I just feel like NCAA tries to do everything and as a result does nothing well in presentation.</li><li>The line play isn't all that great once again (surprised? not I). While there is actually a pass rush this year, it doesn't come at the expense of a collapsing pocket but instead it's like the offensive line 'whiffs' at the block and there is a jailbreak to the QB. The problem I see here are there simply aren't enough animations in line play to accurately depict how it works. Seriously, this is becoming a huge problem with the franchise and hurts the rest of the game because developers try to overcompensate in other areas (like QB accuracy and RB ability) in order to make up for what is simply poorly modeled line play.</li></ul><u><b>Ugly</b></u><ul><li>Sack totals. I've had games on All American where I recorded over 10 sacks. That's not going to fly. Screen passes are especially problematic.</li><li>"There aren't penalties in football except for the occasional holding and offsides!" - Anyone who's only experience with football was through NCAA Football 13.</li><li>There are more plays than just screen plays and deep passes computer AI. Seriously. The A.I. Playcalling is absolutely atrocious from what I'm seeing in the early going. Or maybe it's just the AI's execution? Regardless, the AI seems way off this year when it comes to running an offense.</li><li>Computer running the option...I think there isn't a more ugly thing in the world.</li><li>Heisman FG Logic is still busted. Computer attempted a 58 yarder on me in my lone Heisman foray thus far.</li><li>Still clipping issues, I have players running through each other and such at least once or twice a game. It's 2012.</li><li>Really a lot of the same bugs are back from prior years. This is maddening.</li></ul></div></div></span><div class="relatedstuff" style="color: #393939; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15px; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /></div></blockquote>That is just a laundry list of a broken game. For $60 this shouldn't happen. How do they just keep getting worse? Brand new games shouldn't need patches and tuners right out of the box. Not to mention the terrible gimmicks. Howard playing for OSU? Who fuck thinks that is fun? Maybe like a 10 year old. Hell even I at 10 would have thought "this feels dirty".<br /><br />The last NCAA I bought was NCAA 11. That game was broke as well. I am a dynasty nut so when the recruiting logic of the AI was signing 9 QBs to one class I knew in a few seasons it was going to be donkey dick. And it was. QBs playing TE and RBs playing CB. Oh and the dudes come in so low overall that kickers were missing XP, killing any chance of a close game. Do they not test or sim a dynasty years in advance to see the results of what the AI does? How it recruits? Oh why would they? Suckers buy it anyway... And then the final straw that broke the MY back..<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/IMAG0907.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/IMAG0907.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/IMAG0908.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m32/RTA24/IMAG0908.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Floyd is&nbsp;average but... Not that Average! Crap like this drives me insane. Why is my corner's heading spinning and barfing pea soup? Why do my dudes run through the goal post? Why can't the AI perform a option play when it does it just fine in 2006? Unacceptable!<br /><br />I will give you all some great advice. STOP BUYING THIS GAME. I want it to have the same fate as Fight Night and NBA Live. Let it die. They refuse to put a good product on field(yuk yuk)! EA takes a dump in a dvd case and you all pay $60 for it. Go buy NCAA 2006 for cheap or get NFL2K5 which to this day rivals Madden and does things that Madden still hasn't done(It has SportsCenter!). The game play is awesome and&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;as well(I missed the playoffs last season). There are all kinds of penalties and even off setting ones. You can even get updated <a href="http://www.nfl2k5rosters.com/">rosters here.</a> Just get a transfer cable for your X360 and for around $20 you have the best football game ever made. That isn't&nbsp;opinion. Its a fact people.<br /><br />I hope NCAA at some point dies so 2k can get a shot at it. After playing NFL2k5, their NBA games and College Hoops 2k8(the best college Bball game ever) there is no reason to think they couldn't pull it off. This post is super ranting but screw it. One of my favorite games is pure ass. Tomorrow you have a choice. I hope you all make the right one. Just say NO to NCAA 13<br /><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:158:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/2504175823133794572/comments/defaulthttp://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2012/07/just-say-no-to-ncaa-13.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2504175823133794572";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default/2504175823133794572";s:4:"link";s:69:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/2012/07/just-say-no-to-ncaa-13.html";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}}s:7:"channel";a:12:{s:2:"id";s:45:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3089422185245398538";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2018-03-11T05:10:49.468-07:00";s:5:"title";s:14:"Midnight Maize";s:42:"link_http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed";s:53:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"link_self";s:62:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default";s:4:"link";s:34:"http://midnightmaize.blogspot.com/";s:8:"link_hub";s:32:"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/";s:9:"link_next";s:92:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3089422185245398538/posts/default?start-index=26&max-results=25";s:11:"author_name";s:12:"The Shredder";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/07661208942617845636";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:9:"generator";s:7:"Blogger";}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:4:"Atom";s:12:"feed_version";N;s:8:"encoding";s:10:"ISO-8859-1";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:15:"source_encoding";s:5:"UTF-8";s:4:"etag";s:70:"W/"e4ec73a38af6f2227611ab28b6596e5088d76791c104b394a910bd9b9c6c2e05"
