<p>Late on Friday, October 21, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7549978/maria-pallante-removed-us-register-of-copyrights">news broke</a> that <strong>Maria Pallante</strong>, who had served as Register of Copyrights at the United States Copyright Office had been removed from her post, and reassigned as a special advisor to the Library of Congress on digital strategy.

<p>It&#8217;s no overstatement to say that this news has been greeted with surprise, dismay, and a certain measure of panic from creator groups.

<p>When legal battles about copyright infringement make the news, they tend to concern big stars. big hits, and big dollar amounts, from <strong>Robin Thicke</strong> vs.&nbsp;<strong>Marvin Gaye</strong>&#8217;s estate, to <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>&#8217;s successful defense of their authorship of&#8221;Stairway to&nbsp;Heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">But what about the rest of us? It?s a simple truth that, in the United States, filing a lawsuit for copyright infringement is expensive. </span><a href="http://www.traverselegal.com/copyright-infringement/copyright/how-much-does-it-cost-to-pursue-a-copyright-infringement-claim/" style="font-size: 12px;">Even just sending an initial letter can cost thousands of dollars</a><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"> and a case with a quick settlement can still cost over&nbsp;$10,000.</span></p>
<p>Those charges rise quickly when a case takes years to wind through the courts. When photographer <strong>Daniel Morel</strong> won a $1.2 judgment after a 5-year legal battle against <span class="caps">AFP</span> and Getty Images, <a href="http://petapixel.com/2013/11/23/daniel-morel-awarded-1-2m-damages-law-suit-afp-getty-images/">his law firm had racked up some $2.5 million in legal costs</a>.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">However, even though the jury had found <span class="caps">AFP</span> and Getty had willfully violated his copyright, </span><a href="http://petapixel.com/2015/06/04/the-high-cost-of-suing-for-copyright-infringements/" style="font-size: 12px;">the court refused to grant him attorneys fees</a><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">. This left the law firm that worked with Morel with little hope of collecting on the more than 3,800 hours of work they had put into the&nbsp;case.</span></p>
<p>This is bad news for both plaintiffs, who often can?t afford to file a lawsuit at all, as well as defendants, who are regularly targeted for hefty damages to justify the expenses. &nbsp;For many musicians and composers, this all means that legal recourse, even in clear cases of copyright infringement, may be out of&nbsp;reach.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/small-claims-copyright-act-introduced-in-the-house/122524">a new bill submitted by Representative Hakeem Jeffries</a> (D-<span class="caps">NY</span>) hopes to at least ease some of those costs.

<p>After a recent court victory, <strong>Madonna</strong> is likely to be thanking her lucky stars. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">On June 2nd, </span><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/madonna-gets-victory-vogue-sample-898944" style="font-size: 12px;">the <strong><span class="caps">U.S.</span> Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</strong> ruled 2-1&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">in favor of the dance-pop diva</span><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;and producer </span><strong style="font-size: 12px;">Shep Pettibone</strong><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">, who had been sued by <span class="caps">VMG</span> Salsoul <span class="caps">LLC</span> over her alleged use of a .23-second snippet of the </span><strong style="font-size: 12px;">Salsoul Orchestra</strong><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"> song </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">Love Break</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"> in her 1990 hit </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">Vogue</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">. The court ruled that the use (purported to be a single horn stab) was </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">de minimis</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">, meaning such a small use as to be trivial and not a copyright&nbsp;infringement.</span></p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit ruling is at odds with a 2005 ruling from the Sixth Circuit, <a href="http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/bridgeportdimension.html">Bridgeport Music Inc.. v. Dimension Films</a>. In that case, the court looked at whether <span class="caps">N.W.</span>A., in two of their songs, infringed the copyright of a Funkadelic song by sampling a two-second guitar riff. In that case, the Appeals Court, reversing the lower court, ruled that <em>de minimis</em> did not apply in cases of sampling of a sound recording (while leaving the door open to the possibility of fair use&nbsp;claims.)</p>
<p>This split between the two circuits could even ultimately set the issue on the path to the Supreme Court, though it could be a long time before such a hearing takes place. &nbsp;S<span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">till, the case once again raises the issue of whether very short samples are not only not copyright infringements, but are too trivial to weigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>After a recent court victory, <strong>Madonna</strong> is likely to be thanking her lucky stars. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">On June 2nd, </span><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/madonna-gets-victory-vogue-sample-898944" style="font-size: 12px;">the <strong><span class="caps">U.S.</span> Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</strong> ruled 2-1&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">in favor of the dance-pop diva</span><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;and producer </span><strong style="font-size: 12px;">Shep Pettibone</strong><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">, who had been sued by <span class="caps">VMG</span> Salsoul <span class="caps">LLC</span> over her alleged use of a .23-second snippet of the </span><strong style="font-size: 12px;">Salsoul Orchestra</strong><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"> song </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">Love Break</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"> in her 1990 hit </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">Vogue</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">. The court ruled that the use (purported to be a single horn stab) was </span><em style="font-size: 12px;">de minimis</em><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">, meaning such a small use as to be trivial and not a copyright&nbsp;infringement.</span></p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit ruling is at odds with a 2005 ruling from the Sixth Circuit, <a href="http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/bridgeportdimension.html">Bridgeport Music Inc.. v. Dimension Films</a>. In that case, the court looked at whether <span class="caps">N.W.</span>A., in two of their songs, infringed the copyright of a Funkadelic song by sampling a two-second guitar riff. In that case, the Appeals Court, reversing the lower court, ruled that <em>de minimis</em> did not apply in cases of sampling of a sound recording (while leaving the door open to the possibility of fair use&nbsp;claims.)</p>
<p>This split between the two circuits could even ultimately set the issue on the path to the Supreme Court, though it could be a long time before such a hearing takes place. &nbsp;S<span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;">till, the case once again raises the issue of whether very short samples are not only not copyright infringements, but are too trivial to weigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
