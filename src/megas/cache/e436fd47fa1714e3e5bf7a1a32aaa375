In the terms of contract &nbsp;you buy webhost expecting it to be hosted.. after all you pay for a period of time. That being said if the webhost isnt up for that period of time you are basically paying for nothing! Does anyone know if you can get your money back if the webhost is always offline.. I don't mind a webhost being offline occasionally as all webhosts have problems with datacentres and power supplies and what not but this webhost is offline more than it is online!
