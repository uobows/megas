<br />Back after a long layoff for a weekend post.  Maybe I ought to subtitle this entry, "adventures in scratchy records, part one".  I don't care though because, sometimes, records are great scratches and all. 
<br />
<br />I found this at a recent record show and it's a two-sided winner.  My somewhat limited experience says grab a Falcons record whenever you see one.  This rule certainly applies here. Love the guitar work, among other things.

Well, the 45 acquisitions continue to pile up around these parts. Here's the latest batch. Some were scored off eBay, some from Ray Peters, some from the Indy Record Show and some from a new used record store that just opened in Fountain Square.<br /><br />But before I begin, I need to say in passing that I am currently grieving the loss of my dog Max. It got to the point where he couldn't climb the steps to the house anymore and he was whimpering in constant pain. I could see that the only thing to do was to let Max go. I am very devastated, so please forgive my having to pass this along to you.<br /><br />In the meantime, here we go:<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9966;">Floyd Cramer: Flip Flop and Bop (RCA Victor) This guy is best known for his softer instrumental "Last Date" and I believe he was a top session player in Nashville. This song here is a piano rocker produced by Chet Atkins. Pretty keen for what it is.<br /><br />Boots Brown and His Blockbusters: Cerveza (RCA Victor) He also had a version of "Chili Beans." which I also have. I believe this was a minor Top 40 hit in 1958. At least that's what the guy I bought this from wrote on the sleeve. Pretty kickin' instro with a Latin flair.<br /><br />Los T.J.s: Pure De Papas (RCA Victor (Spanish) (This is one of my favorite pick-ups from the past month, a frantic take on "Hot Pastrami" with lots of screams and yells and a killer guitar break.)<br /><br />Arthur 'Guitar Boogie' Smith: Philadelphia Guitar (Starday). Found this in the dollar bin and it's a red-hot guitar instro from a guy who first hit with "Guitar Boogie" for MGM in 1948 and recorded several records for that label.)<br /><br />Mickey and Sylvia: There'll Be No Backin' Out (Vik) Pretty decent fast mover from the "Love Is Strange" duo. Anybody know what their best record is? Just curious.<br /><br />Jimmy Maddin: Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie (Imperial) This is the original version of the same song Eddie Cochran covered. This has more of an R&amp;B feel with a good guitar break.<br /><br />The Five Dollars: Doctor Baby (Fortune) It's always worth picking up things on the Fortune label and this doo-wop number from a group that usually backed Andre Williams is no exception.<br /><br />Jay Bentley and the Jet Set: Watusi '64 (GNP Crescendo) Good frat-style dancer. Don't know much about it but I do see it around a lot.<br /><br />The Wolf Man: Strange (Okeh) Just what the title says, has Wolfman Jack-style vocals (could this be the real Wolfman Jack?) over a stompin' soul background.<br /><br />The Coasters: The Shadow Knows (Atco) Typical Coasters greatness. "You better watch your P's and Q's and your M's and N's and O's, because The Shadow Knows!"<br /><br />Etta James: The Wallflower (Modern) "Roll with me, Henry," later bowderized by Georgia Gibbs as "Dance With Me, Henry." This is the original and it's great.<br /><br />Little Junior Parker: Stranded (Duke) Pretty good blues stomper from the guy who gave you "Sweet Home Chicago."<br /><br />The Versatones: Bila/Tight Skirt (Fenway) According to my Goldmine guide, this is the second time this single's been issued. It's an upgrade copy of my Atlantic issue, which is all beat up. Both sides of this is off-the-wall doo wop madness of the highest order.<br /><br />Little Richard: Dance What You Wanna (Vee Jay) Pretty good later Little Richard from 1965. He's also got a killer version of "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" on this label from about the same period.<br /><br />Freddy King: Double Eyed Whammy (King) Smokin' hot soul platter from a guy who's got a lot of killer sides, both vocal and instrumental (of course). Comes complete with the expected smokin' guitar work. Me thinks this smokes, get the picture?<br /><br />Eddie Baxter: Fortune Cookie Parts 1 and 2 (Kapp) Pretty cool oriental instro.<br /><br />Terry Noland: Patty Baby (Brunswick) Decent 50s rocker, a little too much emphasis on the backing vocal chorus.<br /><br />Johnny Fortune: Surfer's Trip/Soul Traveler (Park Ave.) Excellent surf guitar two-sider from a guy who's cut quite a few of them, including "Soul Surfer" and "Dragster." From 1963.<br /><br />Buddy Johnson: Rock It (Mercury) Big band blues bopper with rappin' vocals by Mr. Johnson. From 1957)<br /><br />The Jive Bombers: Bad Boy (Savoy) Classic doo-wop heard in the end credits of John Waters' 1990 film "Cry Baby" (I think, though I could be wrong).<br /><br />Stevie Wonder: We Can Work It Out (Tamla) Top 20 hit from 1971 in which Mr. Wonder funkifies the Beatles.<br /><br />Chris Columbo: You Can't Sit Down (Battle) Interesting version of the Phil Upchurch/Dovells tune with emphasis on a coronet. Unfortunately fades out before the drummer gets to get some.<br /><br />Clarence 'Frogman' Henry: Tore Up Over You (Parrot) 1965 oddity from the "Ain't Got No Home" moaner.<br /><br />George Hamilton IV: If You Don't Know (ABC Paramount) The flip of "A Rose and a Baby Ruth" is this not bad rockabilly rocker.<br /><br />Elmore James: Dust My Broom (Jewel) Killer blues as you can expect. Weird thing is that Elmore is mispelled on both sides. One side says "Elmo James," the other says "Elmer James." Weird.<br /><br />Jimmy McGriff: Hello Betty (Sue) Typical killer organ stomper from Mr. McGriff.<br /><br />Elvin Jones: Midnight Walk (Atlantic) Pretty keen jazz instro from this well-known drummer, both sides taken from his album.<br /><br />Dickey Doo and the Don'ts: Ne Ne Na Na Na Na Nu Nu (Swan) Found this at last! Kool whacko instro that I dig a lot.<br /><br />Little Willie John: Take My Love (I Want To Give It All To You) (King) Another winner from Mr. John, this one has him in a fast blues mode.<br /><br />The Jives: I Want You (Tear Drop) Pretty cool Tex-Mex style funk.<br /><br />Jimmy Patton: Ya I'm Movin'/Love Come Back To Me/Let Me Slide/I'm Not Shuckin' (Rollin' Rock) 1970s reissue of some really hot rockabilly that I do indeed dig.<br /><br />Mae West and Somebody's Chyldren: Shakin' All Over (Tower) In which Ms. West brings her shimmyin' ways to rock 'n' roll. From an album called "Way Out West," I believe and pretty cool for what it is.<br /><br />Mae West: Put The Loot in the Boot Santa (Dragonet) More West whackiness, this time for the holidays.<br /><br />Sumpin' Else: Baby You're Wrong (Liberty) Pretty great garage rocker with some fuzz.<br /><br />Eddie Bo: Dinky Doo (Ric) Not my favorite record from this New Orleans legend, but still pretty damn fine, even if a little too sweetened with strings.<br /></span><br />There are a few others, but I need to listen to them a little more first. I've also got a few from last Sunday's record show that I have to go through. We will see.<br /><br />Well, that about brings everything up to date as far as my record collecting goes. Hope you enjoyed reading it and hope to have a couple more things posted before too long. We will see.<br />.";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://itsgreatshakes.blogspot.com/2011/05/and-acquisitions-continue.html";s:6:"author";s:36:"noreply@blogger.com (Brian Marshall)";s:7:"summary";s:6909:"Hello again.

Kool whacko instro that I dig a lot.<br /><br />Little Willie John: Take My Love (I Want To Give It All To You) (King) Another winner from Mr. John, this one has him in a fast blues mode.<br /><br />The Jives: I Want You (Tear Drop) Pretty cool Tex-Mex style funk.<br /><br />Jimmy Patton: Ya I'm Movin'/Love Come Back To Me/Let Me Slide/I'm Not Shuckin' (Rollin' Rock) 1970s reissue of some really hot rockabilly that I do indeed dig.<br /><br />Mae West and Somebody's Chyldren: Shakin' All Over (Tower) In which Ms. West brings her shimmyin' ways to rock 'n' roll. From an album called "Way Out West," I believe and pretty cool for what it is.<br /><br />Mae West: Put The Loot in the Boot Santa (Dragonet) More West whackiness, this time for the holidays.<br /><br />Sumpin' Else: Baby You're Wrong (Liberty) Pretty great garage rocker with some fuzz.<br /><br />Eddie Bo: Dinky Doo (Ric) Not my favorite record from this New Orleans legend, but still pretty damn fine, even if a little too sweetened with strings.<br /></span><br />There are a few others, but I need to listen to them a little more first. I've also got a few from last Sunday's record show that I have to go through. We will see.<br /><br />Well, that about brings everything up to date as far as my record collecting goes. Hope you enjoyed reading it and hope to have a couple more things posted before too long. We will see.<br />.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1304791740;}i:8;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11910289.post-5334634408336071894";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 16:49:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:40:"Vince Edwards - Squeelin' Parrot (Twist)";s:11:"description";s:1281:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zotBoL7s9CA/TasaQujfNlI/AAAAAAAAAxE/mYzikklL5_A/s1600/squeelin%2Bparrot.jpg"><img style="float:center; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 319px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zotBoL7s9CA/TasaQujfNlI/AAAAAAAAAxE/mYzikklL5_A/s320/squeelin%2Bparrot.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5596595836615079506" /></a><br />Just some fun here for a Sunday.

It was the third single for this group of teenagers who recorded this after scoring big with "Black Slacks" and less so with "Penny Loafers and Bobby Sox."  It's kind of a shame that this didn't take off because it's as high quality as their previous two records.   That only means that both sides are KILLER!

It was the third single for this group of teenagers who recorded this after scoring big with "Black Slacks" and less so with "Penny Loafers and Bobby Sox."  It's kind of a shame that this didn't take off because it's as high quality as their previous two records.   That only means that both sides are KILLER!

Well, looks like it's time for yet another list. (Aren't you thrilled?) I've added a few more goodies to my library, which I am going to tell you about right now. These come from eBay and a few other places. So, here they are, without further adieu:<br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Larry Collins: Get Along Home Cindy (Columbia)(At least I think that's the title, but the label's real worn off. Plus, I once watched a clip of The Kingston Trio doing this exact same song in its folk version. This one's a decent rock 'n' roll version with a solid guitar break, as can be expected by one half of The Collins Kids in his adolescent stage.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Galaxies IV: Let Me Hear You Say Yeah (Veep)(Really cool garage frat rock, highly uptempo and charging.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Bluebeards: Come On A-My House (Date)(Sort of a psychedelic version of the old Rosemary Clooney chestnut with some Middle Eastern influence by way of some sitar breaks. Strangely enough, the B-side, "I'm Home," has the exact same melody as Johnnie Walker's "You're All Mine" on Tollie.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Countdowns: You Know I Do (Bear)(Garage punk 'n' roll with some sweet guitar stinging. These guys were from Iowa and this record comes from 1968.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Interns: Hard To Get (Uptown)(Very tough California garage punk from 1968 with fuzz. Wish the copy was a bit better, but it gets the job done.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Stacy Lane: African Twist (Excello) (Stompin' soul, that's all I have to say.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Exciting Voices: Didn't It Rain (Bel Canto)(Swingin' gospel shouter that takes a bit to get started, but when it gets going, it cooks!)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Hound Dog Clowns: Super Fox (Uni)(In which Kim Fowley pretends to be James Brown. Lots of screams on this off-the-wall attempt at funk.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Hully Gully Boys: Yabba (Amy) (Off-the-wall instrumental with lots of African rhythms and tribal yelling. "Fool's Paradise" on WFMU plays a soundbite of this after the soundclip that says "I take real enjoyment in good music, stuff like that. Surprising, huh?"</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Sounds of Jack Downes: Monkey Mash/Up Up and Away (Vistone)(Side A's a smokin' funky instro, while Side B's the Fifth Dimension classic done up the smokin' instrumental way.)</span><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Supertones: Slippin' and Sloppin' (Parts 1 and 2)(Everest)(Pretty cool guitar instrumental on Part 1, less so on Part 2.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Big Beats: Rush Me (Columbia)(Pretty cookin' guitar and sax instrumental. I was told that Trini Lopez is on this.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Chapelaires: Gloria (HAC)(Pretty good slow doo-wop record.

Well, looks like it's time for yet another list. (Aren't you thrilled?) I've added a few more goodies to my library, which I am going to tell you about right now. These come from eBay and a few other places. So, here they are, without further adieu:<br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Larry Collins: Get Along Home Cindy (Columbia)(At least I think that's the title, but the label's real worn off. Plus, I once watched a clip of The Kingston Trio doing this exact same song in its folk version. This one's a decent rock 'n' roll version with a solid guitar break, as can be expected by one half of The Collins Kids in his adolescent stage.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Galaxies IV: Let Me Hear You Say Yeah (Veep)(Really cool garage frat rock, highly uptempo and charging.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Bluebeards: Come On A-My House (Date)(Sort of a psychedelic version of the old Rosemary Clooney chestnut with some Middle Eastern influence by way of some sitar breaks. Strangely enough, the B-side, "I'm Home," has the exact same melody as Johnnie Walker's "You're All Mine" on Tollie.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Countdowns: You Know I Do (Bear)(Garage punk 'n' roll with some sweet guitar stinging. These guys were from Iowa and this record comes from 1968.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Interns: Hard To Get (Uptown)(Very tough California garage punk from 1968 with fuzz. Wish the copy was a bit better, but it gets the job done.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Stacy Lane: African Twist (Excello) (Stompin' soul, that's all I have to say.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Exciting Voices: Didn't It Rain (Bel Canto)(Swingin' gospel shouter that takes a bit to get started, but when it gets going, it cooks!)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Hound Dog Clowns: Super Fox (Uni)(In which Kim Fowley pretends to be James Brown. Lots of screams on this off-the-wall attempt at funk.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Hully Gully Boys: Yabba (Amy) (Off-the-wall instrumental with lots of African rhythms and tribal yelling. "Fool's Paradise" on WFMU plays a soundbite of this after the soundclip that says "I take real enjoyment in good music, stuff like that. Surprising, huh?"</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Sounds of Jack Downes: Monkey Mash/Up Up and Away (Vistone)(Side A's a smokin' funky instro, while Side B's the Fifth Dimension classic done up the smokin' instrumental way.)</span><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Supertones: Slippin' and Sloppin' (Parts 1 and 2)(Everest)(Pretty cool guitar instrumental on Part 1, less so on Part 2.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Big Beats: Rush Me (Columbia)(Pretty cookin' guitar and sax instrumental. I was told that Trini Lopez is on this.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Chapelaires: Gloria (HAC)(Pretty good slow doo-wop record. Not necessarily my cup of tea, but good for what it is.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Starlites: Valerie (Fury)(This is a really cool doo-wop tune that has a righteous desperate vibe to it. Too bad my copy is extremely hammered. I'm glad someone enjoyed it.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">The Night Hawks: Bunny Ride (Pacific)(Decent instrumental with a noir-ish edge to it.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Aretha Franklin: Rough Lover (Columbia)(One of Aretha's pre-Atlantic sides, this is a good soul shouter, with Lady Soul demanding a REAL man.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Buddy Miles Express: Funky Mule/Don't Mess With Cupid (Mercury)(Equally funked-up instro version of the Marvin Holmes classic "Ride Your Mule" with some wild drum work, backed up with a solid pounding version of the Redding-Cropper penned favorite.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Sonny Green: It's A Game/I Can Ketch But I Can't Hold (Fuller)(Pretty solid slow blues two-sider with some shouting vocals.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Dick St. John: Boogie Man (I Ain't Afraid Of You)(Rona) (This goes to my Halloween collection: holiday novelty with lots of sinister laughing.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#33ccff;">Dick Dale and his Deltones: Surf Beat/Peppermint Man (Deltone)(I don't think I need to describe this one.

One of my favorites of this year.   <br /><br /><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="335" height="28" id="divplaylist"><param name="movie" value="http://www.divshare.com/flash/playlist?myId=12713644-625" /><embed src="http://www.divshare.com/flash/playlist?myId=12713644-625" width="335" height="28" name="divplaylist" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed></object>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1286039400;}}s:7:"channel";a:7:{s:13:"lastbuilddate";s:31:"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 13:11:21 +0000";s:5:"title";s:17:"It's Great Shakes";s:11:"description";s:18:"It's Great Shakes!";s:4:"link";s:35:"http://itsgreatshakes.blogspot.com/";s:14:"managingeditor";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Todd Lucas)";s:9:"generator";s:7:"Blogger";s:7:"tagline";s:18:"It's Great Shakes!";}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:3:"RSS";s:12:"feed_version";s:3:"2.0";s:8:"encoding";s:10:"ISO-8859-1";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:15:"source_encoding";s:5:"UTF-8";s:4:"etag";s:70:"W/"24b49112b7baf0f1d8c736e6fb12af1c2d038584664f7414513e595992280fc3"
