After suffering a heavy fall with her horse while competing cross-country at the Jersey Fresh International Three Day Event in 2015, Jessica underwent surgery and was told that she would not recover in time to defend her Pan AM Gold medal. Jessica's spirit and love of the equine sport would be put to the ultimate test! Jessica came back with a full recovery, returning in record time, leading the Canadian Eventing Team at Toronto Pan AM Games and won silver and bronze for team Canada. An outstanding achievement and inspiring story lead to release of song RISE which shares a story of inspiration and empowerment that anyone can relate to when following their dreams or working through any life struggles. Elyse is excited to share this song, as she says, "It's something a little different from my usual sound and style but I know you'll love it." As a rising independent artist in the industry, Elyse is an artist that can relate to this story and can be heard in her vocals and lyric interpretation. <br>Check out the song on Itunes, Apple Music and soon to be released to radio!<br><br><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/content.sitezoogle.com/u/71033/d7f027420878d7d4266f99fd95798a24638775e9/medium/17931749-1926441107567249-2226413022207803392-n.jpg?1494467620" class="size_m justify_left border_" />";s:6:"author";s:12:"

After hearing of the need for winter coats in communities and many not being able to afford the cost of buying one, Elyse wanted to use her platform with the help of her peers to bring people together through music and give back. November 27th Elyse hosted her 4TH annual WARM COATS WARM HEARTS Coat Drive &amp; Concert at The Corral in Oshawa ON. She received support from her country music pals with special performances and KX96 radio host Peter Walker was the emcee. WARM COATS WARM HEARTS collected 500 coats in 2014 and Elyse is excited to announce that she reached her goal of 1000 coats for 2015. The concert was one of the many collaborative efforts that made this goal a reality, donations were not only given to Oshawa residence but to many Mississauga schools this year as well. Elyse very much appreciates the support she had from the ladies of Fight The Cold who helped make this possible. This January another event is in the works to celebrate and commence the 4th annual WARM COATS WARM HEARTS Coat Drive &amp; Concert. </p>
