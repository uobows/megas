<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX (February 6, 2018) </strong>? Following the incredible success of Amplify Austin Day 2017, which raised over $9.8 million for 700 nonprofits in Central Texas, I Live Here I Give Here (ILHIGH) announces that St. David?s Foundation has once again pledged to donate $1 million in matching funds during Amplify Austin?s sixth annual event which is slated to take place March 1 through March 2, 2018.</p>
<p>In addition to this sizable contribution, St. David&#8217;s Foundation has also committed to matching donations (up to $300K total) to the Amplify Stretch Fund which rewards all participating nonprofits with incentive dollars. The Stretch Fund, which has already reached $140,000 and growing for the 2018 event, is distributed on a prorated basis to all nonprofits participating in Amplify Austin Day. Donors will have the option to add a dollar to the overall stretch fund in their checkout cart to support all 700 nonprofits and have that dollar matched by St. David?s Foundation (up to $300k total).</p>
<p>Amplify Austin is an initiative designed to increase philanthropy in Central Texas through online giving for hundreds of Central Texas nonprofits during a single 24-hour period. This year, Amplify Austin aims to raise over $10 million in one day for 700 nonprofits across seven Central Texas counties?Travis, Hays, Williamson, Burnet, Bastrop, Caldwell, and Blanco.</p>
<p>?Austin?s economy is thriving by any measure, yet many of our neighbors and friends across Central Texas do not have access to good healthcare. At St. David?s Foundation, our mission is to make Central Texas the healthiest community in the world, and our support for Amplify Austin helps us to achieve this important milestone. We understand that the challenges we face can only be solved through everyone?s involvement and efforts. Amplify Austin embodies the essence of community and of pulling together to improve the lives of all Central Texans. We are thankful for the invaluable work they are doing to make our community a healthy place for all of us to live, and we are proud to join with them in Amplify Austin Day,? said Earl Maxwell, chief executive officer of St. David?s Foundation.</p>
<p>This year?s commitment brings the total matching contributions by St. David?s Foundation to more than $5.3 million over the past six years, since Amplify Austin?s inception in 2013. The new funds will be distributed on a prorated basis to over 60 St. David?s Foundation nonprofit grant partners that participate in Amplify Austin.</p>
<p>?Our community could not be more grateful for the impact our friends at St. David?s Foundation have made over the past six years,? says Celeste Flores, executive director at I Live Here I Give Here, the producers of Amplify Austin Day. ?They continue to be very instrumental in the success of this annual giving day, helping shape this important campaign for the benefit of the entire community. We hope the Foundation?s generous gift will encourage everyone in the greater Central Texas area to give more during this campaign, knowing their dollars will go further, creating more good and sustaining important programs and services.?</p>
<p>The sixth annual Amplify Austin event is scheduled to run from 6 p.m. on Thursday, March 1, through 6 p.m. on Friday, March 2, 2018. Givers can plan ahead for Amplify Austin Day and schedule donations to their favorite nonprofits. This year, givers are also able to search for nonprofits that have additional match dollars available, like St. David?s Foundation. It?s easier than ever for those interested in giving to find nonprofits located in specific counties or areas, or search by a cause important to them on <a href="http://www.amplifyatx.org">AmplifyATX.org</a>.</p>
<p>New this year, Amplify Austin Day has secured category-dedicated match dollars to reward all participating nonprofit organizations of a certain cause with extra matching dollars. Category stretch funds are being sponsored by various foundations and companies. Sponsored categories currently include the following: Animal Care &amp; Services sponsored by an anonymous donor; Education sponsored by Google Fiber; and Environment sponsored by the Shield-Ayres Foundation. Any Central Texas businesses, companies, or organizations interested in sponsoring a category of nonprofits are encouraged to reach out to Catherine Lucchesi at I Live Here I Give Here, Catherine@ILiveHereIGiveHere.org, to inquire about sponsorship opportunities.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:4551:"<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we think of a superhero, what comes to mind?  A mask, a cape, a superhuman power?someone coming in to save the day for fellow mankind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the mask and cape (but we can get you one if you want), you have all the power you need to be a hero to the citizens of this great region? and there is one day a year when we make it easy.  That is Amplify Austin Day. </span></p>
<p><b>Why Amplify Austin Day?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well let me count the $35M ways.  For the past five years, our community has rallied around a single day to focus on the incredible needs and opportunities of this city and the organizations making change happen. </span></p>
<p><b>So what exactly does this Day do?</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a fraction of what was accomplished in a mere 24hours last March. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collectively made a whole lot of small donations online that added up to the tune of $9.8M. That?s a big number, so let me break it down for you.  It means: 465 pets were saved, 235 new trees were planted along the hike and bike trail, 1.1M free meals were donated to feed local families in need, 5,000 backpacks full of nutritious food were given to kids to avoid weekend hunger, and 3,800+ swimming lessons were made possible for local children, and a whole lot more.  Get the picture?  You and me did this.  Not Batman, Superwoman or Ironman&#8230;WE did that in ONE day. </span></p>
<p><b>So what?s up for 2018?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We must come together more than ever.  When social services are increasing in demand and the opportunities facing our region are vast, the 700 organizations on <a href="https://amplifyatx.ilivehereigivehere.org/">AmplifyATX.org</a> need our super powers once again.  But this time don?t do it alone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are asking you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to not only give back yourself, but ask your family and friends to join this movement and donate alongside you. What about your co-workers? Ask them too &#8211; the ones you like and even the ones you don?t like so much.  Maybe donating together will reveal you have more in common than you think.   </span></p>
<p><b>So how much are we talking?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  How about a cool $10M? We realize that raising 10 million dollars in one day is a very ambitious goal, but this community has growing needs and important opportunities ahead.  This is the one day a year we say, ?I see you nonprofits. I hear your call.  You are doing big work.  And this community deserves it.?  We need you to take action and support these organizations with critical operational dollars for life-changing programs and services &#8212; especially when this is needed the most.  And on this Day your dollar goes further? much further with matches, incentives and additional cash prizes available to nonprofits. </span></p>
<p><b>Are you sure?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We wholeheartedly believe that individuals and businesses will answer this call to give generously and come together on Amplify Austin Day to stand behind the local nonprofit organizations that make Central Texas sustainable and vibrant for all.  From food and basic needs to the arts and parks to caring for our children, families, pets and neighbors, I Live Here I Give Here implores Central Texas residents to make sure that these nonprofits are thriving for the benefit of EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US.</span></p>
<p><b>What?s next then?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Go on to <a href="https://amplifyatx.ilivehereigivehere.org/">AmplifyATX.org</a> and start picking your favorite causes and find a few new ones doing some pretty awesome work. And then I ask you to use your superpowers to inspire others to come along and give with our community on March 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we don?t do it?who will?  We don?t need no stinkin? capes? we got this! </span></p>

<p></p>
<div align="justify">&#8220;Boards have a vital role to play in supporting philanthropic innovation,&#8221; said <strong>Lisa Graham, Co-Founder of Notley</strong>. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to bring Dan Pallotta to Austin because his workshops provide an opportunity for reflection in addition to providing attendees with a framework to take back to their organizations to turn insights into action,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We welcome ED&#8217;s and CEO&#8217;s, board members, and staff to join us in revolutionizing Austin&#8217;s philanthropic ecosystem.&#8221;</div>

<div align="justify">In every Q&amp;A, the first question people ask Pallotta is, &#8220;How can I get my board to think this way?&#8221; Over time, The Bolder Board Training became his formalized response.

";s:12:"atom_content";s:3699:"<p>We could not be more proud to announce <strong>Brittany Morrison as the 2017 Patsy Woods Martin BIG Giver Award recipient</strong>. Brittany will receive the coveted BIG Giver award <strong>in support of her work and ongoing commitment to <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a></strong> at <strong><em>The BIG Give</em> on Friday, September 8 at Hotel Van Zandt</strong>.</p>
<p>Each year, ILHIGH selects one BIG Giver, who has donated their time, talent, expertise and funds to one of the nonprofit?s partner organizations. <strong>The BIG Giver award winner is an advocate for their chosen organization who has created a long-lasting and personal impact on the community</strong>.</p>
<p>?Brittany Byrd Morrison is a remarkable young woman,? said <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> Executive Director Marjorie Mulanax. ?Her willingness to support <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> as a donor and volunteer serves as an inspiring example of how a young person can transform a heartbreaking loss into a passionate advocacy that can benefit other patients and their families.?</p>
<p><strong>Hospice Austin nominated Brittany for her work throughout four years of intense dedication as a vocal champion of the organization</strong>.</p>
<p>The only child of a single parent, Brittany Morrison initially connected with <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> while in her early 20s after becoming the primary caregiver for her mother, who was cared for by <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> despite being unable to afford the full cost of care. After Brittany?s mother passed away, Brittany struggled with grief but knew she could not afford private therapy. <a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> provided Brittany with the organization?s free and low-cost bereavement services, which Brittany says changed her life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hospiceaustin.org/">Hospice Austin</a> is a nonprofit organization that eases the physical, emotional and spiritual pain of any person in the Austin community facing the final months of a serious illness by providing expert and compassionate care, education and bereavement support.</p>
<p>?I Live Here I Give Here?s mission is to inspire the people of Austin and their neighbors to give locally and demonstrate that everyone can be a philanthropist. Brittany Morrison, our 2017 BIG Giver award winner, embodies this through her inspiring work and dedication in supporting Hospice Austin and some of our community?s most vulnerable residents,? said Celeste Flores, Executive Director of I Live Here I Give Here. ?We are extremely proud to have the opportunity to honor her and the dedication she has continued to show to this important cause at The BIG Give this fall.?</p>
<p><strong>Over 300 guests are expected to attend </strong><strong>The BIG Give in 2017</strong>, which will highlight the Austin community?s accomplishments over the past decade since the founding of ILHIGH in 2007 and honor the individuals and businesses that have continued to support the local nonprofit. Tickets are on sale now at <a href="http://ilivehereigivehere.org/the-big-give/">www.ilivehereigivehere.org/the-big-give</a>. Stay tuned, as more details surrounding the 2017 fundraising event will be announced in the weeks ahead.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:4448:"<p><strong>I Live Here I Give Here (ILHIGH)</strong> is excited to <strong>announce an updated brand design as the local nonprofit celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2017</strong>. In honor of this important milestone in the Austin community and greater Central Texas area, <strong>the nonprofit organization now aims to raise over $10M in 2017,</strong> including the record-breaking amount that was raised on Amplify Austin Day this past March. Central Texans can now use the <a href="http://www.AmplifyATX.org/">AmplifyATX.org</a> platform 365 days a year to fundraise and donate to their favorite local causes.</p>
<p><strong>This has been a milestone year for ILHIGH for many reasons</strong>, most specifically due to the nonprofit?s annual daylong fundraising event, Amplify Austin Day, which raised more than $9.8 million from 64,500+ individual donations. The funds raised through Amplify Austin Day benefited roughly 700 nonprofits in seven Central Texas counties, including Travis, Hays, Williamson, Burnet, Bastrop, Caldwell and Blanco counties. <strong>As both ILHIGH and Austin Amplify Day?s reach has continued to expand each year</strong> in terms of participating nonprofits and both individual and corporate donors, <strong>the team realized the need to</strong><strong> refresh the brand to allow for further regional and partner expansion.</strong></p>
<p>?We are so excited to finally reveal the newly redesigned branding for ILHIGH and each of our annual programs,? said ILHIGH Executive Director Celeste Flores. ?We feel as though this organization?s new look and feel honors our past and recognizes what the community here in Central Texas has built, especially as we celebrate our 10th anniversary and attempt one of our most ambitious goals yet in raising a total of $10 million this year on our <a href="http://www.AmplifyATX.org/">AmplifyATX.org</a> platform. With 700 local organizations, 9 different causes, located in 7 counties?the possibilities are endless. The community deserves it.?</p>
<p>Beyond Amplify Austin Day, <strong>ILHIGH incorporates more than five programs and initiatives year-round</strong> that engage the emerging donor community and connect individuals with causes?<strong>See Jane Give, Give Back Jack, The BIG Give, Community Needs Spotlight </strong>and<strong> Austin Involved</strong>. The team decided to <strong>refresh each of the accompanying program logos</strong> to maintain brand integrity and consistency throughout the nonprofit?s robust collection of community initiatives.</p>
<p>ILHIGH credits several individuals that have made this brand refresh possible, specifically <strong>MP Mueller</strong>, former ILHIGH board member, and <strong>Bryan Keplesky</strong>, who oversaw the new project after being involved in the original design many years ago. Mueller?s prior advertising and branding agency, Door Number 3, was actually behind producing the original Amplify Austin Day logo that Keplesky designed at the time while working as an employee at Mueller?s firm.</p>
<p>?It truly has now come full-circle for myself and MP and we could not be more excited to help lead this new rebranding initiative because of the positive impact it will inevitably make in spreading the word and raising more funds,? said Bryan Keplesky. ?This brand refresh will hopefully not only help ILHIGH hit its $10 million goal by the year?s end, but also help engage more community members and spread the word about the nonprofit?s importance here in Central Texas.?</p>
<p>?I was delighted to work with Bryan again, see how the organization and its programs have evolved. We truly look forward to seeing what the next 10 years brings for I Live Here I Give Here,? said MP Mueller.</p>

<p class="p5">Following the incredible success of <a href="https://amplifyatx.ilivehereigivehere.org/">Amplify Austin</a> 2016, which raised over $8.5 million for more than 600 Central Texas nonprofits, I Live Here, I Give Here (ILHIGH) announces that <a href="https://stdavidsfoundation.org/">St. David?s Foundation</a> will donate $1 million during Amplify Austin?s fifth annual event, which is slated to take place March 2 through March 3, 2017.</p>
<p class="p5">Amplify Austin is an initiative designed to increase philanthropy in Central Texas through online giving for hundreds of Central Texas nonprofits during a 24-hour period. For this year, Amplify Austin aims to raise over $9 million in one day for more than 700 nonprofits across seven Central Texas counties?including Travis, Hays, Williamson, Burnet, Bastrop, Caldwell and Blanco?as well as an additional $1 million throughout the rest of 2017.</p>
<p class="p5">?<a href="https://stdavidsfoundation.org/">St. David?s Foundation</a> is proud to support one of our community?s most beloved days of the year, especially one that touches so many lives here in the Austin area,? said Earl Maxwell, Chief Executive Officer of <a href="https://stdavidsfoundation.org/">St. David?s Foundation</a>. ?Our partnership over the past five years has been truly rewarding, and we hope that this donation will inspire potential donors, new and old, to support local nonprofit organizations that provide vital services in and around our Central Texas community.?</p>
<p class="p5">This year?s commitment brings the total matching contributions by <a href="https://stdavidsfoundation.org/">St. David?s Foundation</a> to more than $4.2 million over the past five years, since Amplify Austin?s inception in 2013. The new funds will be distributed on a prorated basis to over 60 <a href="https://stdavidsfoundation.org/">St. David?s Foundation</a> nonprofit grant partners that participate in Amplify Austin.</p>
<p class="p5">?Our entire organization could not be more grateful for the continued support that our friends at St. David?s Foundation have continued to demonstrate over the past five years,? says Celeste Flores, Executive Director at <a href="http://ilivehereigivehere.org/">ILHIGH</a>. ?They continue to be so very instrumental in the success of our annual Amplify Austin event, and have helped shaped this important campaign for the benefit of the entire community. We now hope the Foundation?s generous gift will encourage others in the greater Central Texas area to give more during this campaign, knowing their dollars will go further, creating more good, important work.?</p>
<p class="p5">The fifth annual Amplify Austin event is scheduled to run from 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 2 until 6:00 p.m. on Friday, March 3, 2017.

";s:12:"atom_content";s:5009:"<p><b>Why Amplify Austin Day?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can give you 24.7 million reasons why this online movement is important to our Central Texas region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the many challenges our growing area faces. We also know the things we love the most about our city ? those things that put us at the top of every list. These issues we tackle and things we love are all supported by an important nonprofit infrastructure. They are providing the programs and services to make this a vibrant, sustainable and equitable community for all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On <a href="https://amplifyatx.ilivehereigivehere.org/">Amplify Austin Day</a>, you are able to go to one place to find 700 mission-driven organizations providing real and tangible solutions. A donor can make a donation to an old favorite as well as add a new nonprofit to the checkout cart. All of these small donations are adding up to BIG impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://ilivehereigivehere.org/">I Live Here, I Give Here</a> has built this campaign for the benefit of the whole community to make a powerful connection between the donor (changemakers) and nonprofits (solution providers) that will make this the best place to live, work and play.</span></p>
<p><b>National Scope</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Days started in 2009 and are in many cities across the nation. Many are local homegrown efforts to rally a community to give. There are some national and international giving days that have evolved like <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a> and <a href="http://www.givelocalamerica.org/">Give Local America</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>, which has built a Giving Day Initiative, supports 18 giving day organizers to encourage informed and engaged communities and innovation in digital technologies. Over the last four years, those 18 communities have raised $116M while engaging 367,000 donors and mobilizing over 20,000 participating organizations?and growing!</span></p>
<p><b>In Central Texas</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the first Amplify Austin Day in 2013, I?ve witnessed this 24-hour campaign raise almost $25M for hundreds of local nonprofit organizations that serve the entire community. Over 160,000 individual gifts from individual donors, like you, and companies have made this impact possible.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This campaign is a gateway for local philanthropy. Nonprofits attest the largest benefits of the Day, in addition to funding, are the increased visibility on the whole sector; immediate call to action for donors; and a new, younger donor pipeline walking through their doors. Of all gifts given during the last Amplify campaign, 40% were first time donations. And 31% of the <a href="http://AmplifyATX.Org">AmplifyATX.org</a> site users were millennials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amplify donors report that the top motivations to give on the Day are the stories and missions they read about on social media or on the site. It?s also because the impact of the Day is happening in our backyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign uses the power of collective giving, online peer encouragement and social media. This Day is fun and different. Nonprofits are able to compete for bonus prize dollars and donors are able to maximize their giving because of matches and incentives created by the Day.     </span></p>
<p><b>It is up to Us!     </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amplify Austin Day is produced by I Live Here, I Give Here, a nonprofit organization itself, dedicated to cultivating the power of giving back and engaging the next generation of givers. For all the reasons I listed above and then some, it is important to the 700 nonprofits that this movement is sustainable and continues to grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/42">Charity Navigator</a>, 71% of all charitable giving in 2015 was made by individuals &#8211; that means YOU and ME!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Day engages individuals to make donations, fundraise for a favorite nonprofit or engage in giving with co-workers ? all supporting our favorite causes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I look forward to seeing you on AmplifyATX.org on March 2 &amp; 3. It is up to us to care for this place we love and call home.</span></p>
<p>-Celeste Flores, Executive Director, I Live Here, I Give Here</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:3954:"<p>The world our kids are growing up in is not the same one we remember when we were their age. There are self-driving cars, hours of cat YouTube videos, and multiple tablets in every home. Even the way we interact with philanthropy and charity is changing. In the past year, online donations increased by 13% and online giving movements like Giving Tuesday and Amplify Austin Day are providing a space for donors to make gifts easily to an expansive range of needs in our communities.</p>
<p>Nearly 1/3 of all online donations are made from peer-to-peer fundraising in which individuals reach out to their networks on social media, through email, over the phone and ask their friends and family to consider giving to their cause. To meet this need, AmplifyATX.Org provides a space for individuals or groups to create their own fundraising pages where they can receive direct donations to the nonprofit of their choice. We?ve made it easier than ever to find your cause, fundraise for your favorite nonprofit, and share your story online. On Amplify Austin Day last year, 2,831 Individual Fundraisers made over $1.8 Million in just one day of online giving.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you and your family? It means that there is a whole new way to engage your family in the community, to bring your family together and to instill your children with important values and priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to making giving a lifestyle in your home:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving and volunteering helps build a child?s confidence and sense of self-satisfaction.  They feel good about being able to help others.</li>
<li>Research shows that adults who were introduced to philanthropy as children are far more likely to volunteer and give as adults as those who did not.  They also donate a larger percentage of their income as adults.</li>
<li>Volunteering provides the opportunity for children to interact with people of a variety of different cultures, lifestyles and income levels, which helps to breakdown stereotypes and foster greater acceptance and understanding of others.</li>
<li>Giving back feels good, and lets kids know that they can<em> </em>make a difference. Kids? involvement in service to others brings out their sense of self worth, giving them the understanding that they have something to contribute to society.</li>
<li>Giving together can unite your family across years, geographic locations and life circumstances.</li>
<li>When you give together, your children have the opportunity to work and make decisions as a part of a team.</li>
<li>On AmplifyATX.Org, kids can explore nonprofits and develop their own values as they learn about the world around them.</li>
<li>Learning about philanthropy teaches children how to manage money and understand how spending, saving and giving function together.</li>
<li>The process of finding their cause will develop critical thinking, listening and communication skills.</li>
</ul>
