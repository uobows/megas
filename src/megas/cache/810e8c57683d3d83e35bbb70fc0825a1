<p>Trumpeter Jaimie Branch, who wowed the masses with last year's <i>Fly or Die</i>, is a frequent collaborator with drummer Jason Nazary (of Bear in Heaven, Little Women, Helado Negro). Together, with the addition of synthesizers into their sound, the pair are Anteloper, exploring psychedelic directions and feeling quite free. They're set to release their album (or, er, cassette), <i>Kudu</i>, April 20th on the International Anthem label, so be on the lookout for that. In the meantime, take a while and bask in the odd expanse that is the first single, "Ohoneotree Suite", after the jump while preordering the album.</p>

<p>Bassist/composer <a href="http://zacknestelpatt.com/" target="_blank">Zach Nestel-Patt</a> describes his debut album, <i>River Run</i>, as having "the sensibilities of an indie rock album" while still rooted in jazz elements and the "tradition of improvised music". It's a succinct, but accurate descriptor of his work. <i>River Run</i> has the jumble of the avant-garde with the gentle temperance and focus one would hear from Bon Iver or Grizzly Bear. Altogether, there's something particular here, something special, something that allows for grandiosity for a trio led from a bassist's big ideas.</p>

<p>Mopo is the trio out of Finland of Linda Fredriksson on alto &amp; baritone saxophones, Eero Tikkanen on acoustic &amp; electric bass and violin, and Eeti Nieminen on drums, percussion, and synthesiser. Their new album, <i>Mopocalypse</i>, out now on Finnish label We Jazz Records, shows this group as a tight group with a clean sound. It has just the right balance of slickness with grit, with Fredriksson's saxophones keeping the sound in the back end, Tikkanen's bass riding along nicely, and Nieminen's drums making for interesting turns. Their a group with a punkish sound with more structure.</p>
