On 12/7/17, the program was entitled &quot;Time&#039;s Person of the Year: People Who Broke Silence On Sexual Abuse.&quot;  At one point, one of the guests, Sarah Sobieraj, seemingly talked about an article on the NCFM website, A Few Quick Thoughts on the Current Sexual Abuse Hysteria at           http://ncfm.org/2017/11/news/discrimination-news/discrimination-against-men-news/ncfm-member-jim-jackson-a-few-quick-thoughts-on-the-current-sexual-abuse-hysteria/  As usual for feminists she totally distorted the article in order to disparage it.  She said that the article&#039;s purpose was to discredit women who have come forward with sexual harassment charges.  This was a blatant lie.  I don?t know how she could have read the article and come up with this interpretation.  The purpose of the article was to give the other half of the story, men&#039;s story, which this show and this woman are trying to discredit and censor.  The lace curtain strikes again.
