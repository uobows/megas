With every cell of my body. I ache to hold his body and kiss his cheeks, ear, on down to his neck; stroke his hair; and feel his hand on my face. I miss seeing him wake up so happy and look towards the window, as if it would tell him what kind of a day it would be.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I miss him always being there, with me. On the floor. Putting him in his rocker, wheelchair, bouncer, high chair, or walker. I miss rolling the ball to him, him kicking it back to me, or picking it up and rocking it next to his face. The most gentle blissful smile.&nbsp; I miss his beaming eyes. Miss helping him to stand, roll, rock, reach, and play.</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It is quite an interesting thing when someone you love so much and spend every minute with passes. It is a difficult cross to bear. Time seems like forever. It already feels like forever since I held him. And feels like an eternity before I will hold him again. I know that is not true, and of course I am so grateful for the knowledge that I do have, that the only thing that will be for eternity is actually being with him. And my other boys and Dave and all our great loved ones here and there. That is what eternity is, and I hold on to that.</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Both in Paxton?s life and death I have been nudged to see the more eternal perspective of things. Of this life. Of our cares and worries. Even 6 months later, I have been trying so hard to work on his photo books, putting his videos together in some sort of place&nbsp;</span></span>for them to live on,<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;in some order. It is hard. Hard to get the time to do it with two other youngsters running around; hard because of the emotion it enlists, especially to be interrupted all too soon and have to cut off that core emotion so abruptly. But I also know having these kids is what keeps me going. You have to. ...Still, even with how important those good ?things? (projects) are that I want to do, I have come to realize that even they (as important as they are to me), are just things. They are not Paxton, himself. I could work all day on those treasured memories, giving them a place to rest with us forever, but my house could burn down and I could lose everything and all that really matters is my family. Just like when Paxton was here, with Paxton, it?s the relationship that counts. Not things. Not even good things that we make or read or do. People matter. That?s why I have to take it all in stride, in such careful balance. Two days ago Camden asked me to come play out in the snow with them. I realized it made me feel so good to be asked, and there was nothing better I could do with my time. And I was right! It was so fun for me, too! Sledding and having a snow fight was just what the Dr ordered! I had just come back from California the weekend before- so beautiful and refreshing and I felt like I could see and feel Paxton in every butterfly, hummingbird, and sunset. Then, as I was playing with the boys outside, the sky here was so glorious. The sun setting was as breathtaking as in California, and I just felt such a surge of gratitude. Life is good. Life is so beautiful. Life and Time with those we love is all that really matters. It is such a blessing and a gift! I know there are so many good things to do, even better things. But I?m convinced that the<i> best</i> things have to do with people, the relationships in our lives. Whether it is with God, our family, our friends, ourselves, nurturing our Spirits is all we can take with us and all that will really bring us fulfillment, even here. I am living experience of learning this. I?m grateful God is still teaching me. I know He will. I want so badly to feel His presence, and to feel Paxton?s presence. I know he is busy.</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">I?m not like other moms who have seen their child who has passed (in a vision or dream), having such a peaceful experience that gets them through any hard moment. I wish I was. I hope to become one of those moms. (Really, really bad.) But it may not come. It may be part of the test. I remember that I am loved. I know God loves me, that?s why He gave me these precious souls to live with. I know Paxton loves me, that?s why he came and stayed so long (one of the many reasons). So it?s okay. I have to trust in God, and I do. I know where Paxton is. I honestly don't even doubt it. That's not&nbsp;</span></span>what's hard.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">I know he is busy doing such good things, ministering to even more people than he could here because of mortal limitations. I know he is blessing all of those close to him. Sometimes I am the lucky one to feel him. But he is very busy.</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It has helped me so much, since just after New Year?s, when I got a sweet card from my niece. She told me all the ways she misses Paxton, too, and finished it off with, ?I know it's hard, but at least he was yours to remember.?</span></span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Wow. Out of the mouth of a child. I am SO grateful and humbled that Paxton is ours to remember. That WE had him to live with us and teach us so many beautiful things about life. I miss the part of me that is no longer working in that way, that is dormant, the feeling that came from taking care of his precious body and spirit every day. It was such a blessing and a gift!! He was so perfect and peaceful and still. His body was active but his spirit was so still. He spoke so many sermons without ever saying a word. Oh, I love that boy so much.&nbsp;</span></span>I miss the great, strong, perfect way you loved.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit; letter-spacing: 0px;">I miss who you made me, Paxton, and I miss you so much!&nbsp;</span></div><div style="min-height: 14px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XOOdxNxWdk0/UtnCLcO074I/AAAAAAAAA8Y/8PGxpUHwYvM/s1600/pax+and+me.png" imageanchor="1" style="display: inline !important; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XOOdxNxWdk0/UtnCLcO074I/AAAAAAAAA8Y/8PGxpUHwYvM/s1600/pax+and+me.png" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">So today I (need to) choose Gratitude.

I miss you and still cherish you, Paxton, every bit of you. My heart swells with gratitude for the gift of getting to live with you for three years! I am so thankful. Thank you!!!

Our precious son, Paxton, passed away on July 17. You can read his <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/paxton-edward-norton/%20article_5cadb31d-89e0-526e-be29-756fa8a23ca0.html" target="_blank">obituary here</a>.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div style="line-height: 24px;"><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I have wanted to get on here since to share SOMETHING, ...but which of the constant flood of thoughts or many emotions do I choose to share??? Where do I begin? This will not be by any means all-inclusive, but perhaps satisfy the demands of my heart to share ...something.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First, &nbsp;I must say thank you. Certainly to everyone reading this, and to many others as well. For the sincere and continued prayers, love, and support of Paxton, our family, and the journey we have traveled for the last three and a half (pregnancy) years. I'm so grateful for everyone who has helped us, and especially those who really shared in the "knowing" of Paxton and who he is, with us. I have felt their love as we have witnessed them mourning the loss of his treasured presence alongside us.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our life changed so much when we learned of Paxton's challenges in utero, when he was born, and now with his passing it is completely changing again. At first we mourned the loss of a normal, healthy, full life. The things he wouldn't do as a child, the things we wouldn't do as family. We came to accept those and deal with the circumstances as they were, certainly making the best of all that we COULD do. Now we are mourning being separated from that beautiful, perfect, innocent, happy, hard, special-needs and special blessings life. ...We are sad to lose the opportunities and blessings that having Paxton brought to us. Perhaps it is like being released from being a bishop, a missionary, any calling that you absolutely treasured that unique time for. Although it was hard, that is what made it so special and the blessings of the effort given so abundant. ..What made it so hard to say goodbye and to rearrange the time and efforts of your life, taking what you have learned and putting it all into action in new ways and allowances.</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We miss Paxton everyday. We see his toys and his walkers, his equipment and supplies, his favorite blankets, toys, and spots to sit and play in the house. Where we would see him when we walked in the room or (for Dave-) in the house. Where we would pick him up and throw him in the air and tickle him all over. We long to see him there rocking and twisting, looking up and reaching out. I wish I had a perfect video in my head that would never forget one detail- one pixel of his face or one frame of his movement, that I could play back at any time. That I could perfectly see him lifting his chin and tilting his head back as a huge grin spreads across his cutest little face. How his eyes danced as he smiled at who knows what (or who). And yet maybe a perfect memory can't be afforded because it breaks my break heart when I let myself go there so deeply. I can't believe how much I love and would wish to hold a body! Truly I never knew. Even in burying him, touching his body wasn't the same because his spirit had already gone. But, oh how I miss touching his simple body, skin and hair. It was all so perfect and beautiful to me, and I felt so lucky to be the one to take care of him and bathe him, hold him and carry him. Never once did I hold him without all of his attachments, until after his spirit had left his body. I can only imagine the intense joy that will exude from my body when I can finally hold him- body and spirit- after the Resurrection. Suddenly this blink of life seems a bit long to "endure to the end". &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm feeling like I can go a couple of days with being pretty positively focused on the boys, the house, responsibilities, etc., but then comes a point where I just need to let myself sit and 'go there'. To feel what I need to feel, cry like I need to cry, and just plain miss and think of him. As sad and hard as it is, you want to remember so much every detail. You don't mind the sharp pain because it means you are remembering. Even still, I have learned it is good to be busy, with what I call "healthy distractions", to not "stay" in those hard, long, and sad moments. I know where I draw my strength from and after searching in the scriptures and talks from others on the topic, I have the hope and peace I need to get up and go forward again. These things really help me and I am so grateful there is such an availability to find what we need so easily. Luckily, I have a spirit that once it learns and feels something deeply, it stays with me, and I continually build upon it. So the strength I derive sustains me until it hurts again, and then I build something upon what I learned and felt last time.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;I know where Paxton is. I know he is happy. That death was sweet to him and we will be with him again. That he would be sad and confused to see us so sad over him ...being in Heaven! I can just envision him whispering to us to remember, "But you know where I am, Mom. This is not sad at all! Thank you for loving me and caring for me while I was there... Now just keep going strong so you can come be with me again. All of you. You will love it when you get here; It's worth it, I promise! It will be here in no time!"</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sometimes, no matter what you know, it is still just plain hard going through it. But for the most part, I have felt blessed with 'eternal perspective glasses' that have brought great clarity to my life. They give me personal fortifying peace and strength. A motivation and desire to "hope for the things of a better world" and to use this time "to prepare to meet God." To give my living children opportunities to feel the Spirit, choose the right, and feel loved and connected to us everyday. These are the things that are most important, and I never want to forget them.</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A couple weeks ago on a night when grief hit me hard, I found a talk entitled, "The Doors of Death", by Elder Russell M. Nelson. It helped me to realize there are more reasons to rejoice than to be sad. Do you know what a gift that kind of incredible awareness gives?! I felt so strong and even happy. I immediately wanted to share with Dave all that I had learned and felt from it's words. I share with you these words that have helped me so much in dealing with this "Birth we call death", this "passing" from one life to the next, this transition we have to make of learning to live with a loved one separated for a time, on the other side of the veil. From the brilliant words of Elder Nelson:</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Death separates "the spirit and the body [which] are the soul of man." (D&amp;C 88:15.) That separation evokes pangs of sorrow and shock among those left behind. The hurt is real. Only its intensity varies. Generally the younger the victim, the greater the grief. Yet even when the elderly or infirm have been afforded merciful relief, their loved ones are rarely ready to let go. The only length of life that seems to satisfy the longings of the human heart is life everlasting.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Mourning is one of the deepest expressions of pure love. It is a natural response in complete accord with divine commandment: "Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die." (D&amp;C 42:45.)&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The only way to take sorrow out of death is to take love out of life. (!)</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Eternal perspective provides peace "which passeth all understanding." (Philip. 4:7.)</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We were born&nbsp;to die, and we die to live. (See 2 Cor. 6:9.) As seedlings of God, we barely blossom on earth; we fully flower in heaven.</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Scriptures teach that death is essential to happiness: "Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness." (Alma 42:8; italics added; see also 2 Ne. 9:6.) &nbsp; (!)</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Our limited perspective would be enlarged if we could witness the reunion on the other side of the veil, when doors of death open to those returning home. Such was the vision of the psalmist who wrote, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." (Ps. 116:15.)&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Mortality, temporary as it is, is terminated by the doors of death. Questions then come to searching minds of those left behind. &nbsp;While many questions cannot be fully answered with available knowledge, much is known. ... (see talk for more details on what happens after death, where the spirits go and what they are doing.)</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Meanwhile, we who tarry here have a few precious moments remaining "to prepare to meet God." (Alma 34:32.) Unfinished business is our worst business. Perpetual procrastination must yield to perceptive preparation. Today we have a little more time to bless others-time to be kinder, more compassionate, quicker to thank and slower to scold, more generous in sharing, more gracious in caring.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Then when our turn comes to pass through the doors of death, we can say as did Paul: "The time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith." (2 Tim. 4:6-7.)&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;We need not look upon death as an enemy. With full understanding and preparation, faith supplants fear. Hope displaces despair. The Lord said, "Fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full." (D&amp;C 101:36.) He bestowed this gift: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." (John 14:27.)&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;As a special witness of Jesus Christ, I testify that He lives! I also testify that the veil of death is very thin. I know by experiences too sacred to relate that those who have gone before are not strangers ...to us and to you, our loved ones may be just as close as the next room-separated only by the doors of death.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;With that assurance, brothers and sisters, love life! Cherish each moment as a blessing from God. (See Mosiah 2:21.) Live it well-even to your loftiest potential. Then the anticipation of death shall not hold you hostage. With the help of the Lord, your deeds and desires will qualify you to receive everlasting joy, glory, immortality, and eternal lives. For this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I love these words!</span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yesterday I was able to share my testimony. I felt this burning desire to share with the youth, those who have prayed for Paxton for 3 years, and seen him get better, time after time, in accordance with our faith... I felt like it was so important for them to know that because Paxton didn't get better this time doesn't mean that God doesn't love us, or that we didn't exhibit enough faith, or that He didn't hear and answer our prayers, or that we weren't "blessed" because Paxton wasn't healed this time. (Ironically, the day our family and friends fasted for us was the very day Paxton passed, and I KNEW, even before the fast began, that their prayers and faith this time would be to help us to accept God's will for Paxton.) Sometimes it takes more faith to not be healed, than to be healed. Paxton was going to return home this time, and that was simply because it was God's will and God's appointed time for Paxton. Paxton had accomplished his mission here on this earth. I believe even the time he was allowed to stay with us was an incredible gift, that possibly it was even longer than originally planned. And even if not, what a gift his 3 years have been! They have changed us all and made us want to be better. To do God's will and follow His plan. To celebrate the simple beauties of life and to joy in the love we feel one for another.</span></div></div></div></div><div style="line-height: 24px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div style="line-height: 24px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm so grateful for God's love for us. Isn't it amazing that without death we could never have a fullness of joy? It is a necessary part of the plan of Happiness! We are not meant to live here forever. It's not our eternal home! One day we will all go there and see and feel and remember all that we knew before and be so glad we did everything in our power to return there. I know this is true. I know God loves us and sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer for (that thereby He could suffer WITH) us, to die for us and overcome death on the third day (yes, there is really something special about those 3's). I'm so grateful there is a merciful God who knows the details of our lives and will guide them if we want Him to. I'm so grateful for a grand reunion and Resurrection that we can be together again, and not only feel each other's spirits but embrace fully, both body and spirit, those souls we have since lost and loved a while. I love this Gospel. I don't know how I could function and breath so happily without it. Life would certainly be full of despair and not feel very worth living at all. I'm so glad I know there is so much more than that to offer, a truth which brings that "peace which passeth all understanding." I wish to share it with the world, and that is why I venture to leave these words with you today. I know God, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, LIVE, and that because they live, we shall live also. I share these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen!</span></div></div><div style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0976563); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(191, 107, 82, 0.496094); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875); font-family: Noteworthy; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0976563); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(191, 107, 82, 0.496094); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875); font-family: Noteworthy; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-S-Aj2Ka_tE8/UiTQ2F8NFNI/AAAAAAAAA6c/fV5hUmW8a6k/s640/blogger-image-1697849356.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-S-Aj2Ka_tE8/UiTQ2F8NFNI/AAAAAAAAA6c/fV5hUmW8a6k/s640/blogger-image-1697849356.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/8591094417562271163/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=8591094417562271163";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/8591094417562271163";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/8591094417562271163";s:4:"link";s:59:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2013/09/peace.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:2;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-7727082567360595021";s:9:"published";s:29:"2013-06-08T15:55:00.002-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2013-06-08T15:55:50.433-06:00";s:5:"title";s:19:"Progressing in 2013";s:12:"atom_content";s:13117:"<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Norton Family is doing great.

Pax did have a little setback at the beginning of May but has since recovered and seems to be doing well now.

Touching your face is his way of discovering you. But as he gets older I hope the mouth fetish goes away a bit. :) He likes to grab onto mine and Dave's mouth like a fishing hook. Not so fun when his nails need to be trimmed, which is very frequently.</span></div></span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He IS a ball-boy! (Just like his daddy prayed for.) He LOVES balls, especially his white baseball. Whenever he sees it he just beams and can't wait to grab it and hug it to the side of his face. He loves pushing balls back and forth on the ground to whoever wants to play with him. And he loves to kick the ball when he is in his walker. We may have a special olympics soccer player in training here.</span></div></span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Paxton just got a new stander, courtesy of his awesome older cousin, Carson.

I think he knew something was up because he was just so happy at those </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">miracle&nbsp;moments. Afterwards he got to meet some pretty special people who have been praying for him since he was born. He even got a kiss on his forehead from President Uchtdorf.

Wow, everything was so first class and top notch.

It is so fun to share it with them. The memories made me smile today when I was loading and unloading Paxton's wheelchair and equipment in and out of the car and his dr apts today. Sometimes it is a lot of tiring work, but it is so fun to have those magical moments that keep your family going for a long time.&nbsp;</span></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">My three favorite moments were seeing Mackay getting to place the bases down on the carefully groomed sand, and then continuing to pounce on them quite un-cautiously; Camden out with the grounds crew spraying the field with the hose; and of course, Paxton rolling his favorite stuffed baseball down the pitcher's mound to the Bee's catcher, just about 4 feet away. It was the cutest thing. The Bees were amazing to us, in every way. From custom-made&nbsp;jerseys, to pre-game field, dugout, locker room time with the players, a signed bat and ball</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"> </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">(from the away team, too!), great ballgame food&nbsp;provided, and amazing kindness shown to us from every level of the park at every step of the evening.

Wow! I love the blogging world in all of the good it can do; what a great way it can be to share wonderful and powerful learning experiences with others, strengthening them in the process. So I am thankful to those mamas!<br /><br />Our Pacman is recovering from some surgeries he had last Tuesday. At first I thought his recovery would be smoother than most, because it seemed his pain was so well controlled the first day and half. But since then we have continued to see other complications, as usual. High fevers up to 104.2, morphine not cutting the pain, sedation not cutting the agitation, blood in stomach, etc. etc. With Pax after surgeries, so often we realize an infection has brewed but it is such a puzzle to find out where it is ocurring. For the past week, he wouldn't open his eyes, and would literally kick and thrash back and forth constantly on the bed all day and much of the night. He was so swollen and his eyes so puffy, that now they are cracked and peeling. These recoveries are not my favorite. Even when you have "scheduled" surgery and can plan and prepare, knowing you will be here for at least a week, the going through it is still so tiring and draining. I hate to not be able to do anything to calm, comfort, or even decipher his pain. Thankfully, today I feel we are on the path to ending that phase of this process. Though still wincing and rocking, he has much calmer periods today, I can hold him again, he is opening his eyes, and he has given me a few smiles. Yay! We have had 24 hours now without a fever and now we are just waiting for some bowels to get moving and tolerating feeds again. Whatever the antibiotic and pain meds are helping, they're working. Yippee! I'm hoping and praying we will not see another virus or complication before we get to go home.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fFOBD80v1Bk/UKKcXsGBtyI/AAAAAAAAAyM/EZqmNN5PRWA/s1600/pax+11-12+surgery.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fFOBD80v1Bk/UKKcXsGBtyI/AAAAAAAAAyM/EZqmNN5PRWA/s640/pax+11-12+surgery.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Being in the hospital always makes me super contemplative. It becomes so apparent at these times where my efforts are failing, what my kids need more and less of, how Paxton has changed our life- the good, the hard, the reality; how hard we have to work to get to spend any time together, and how blessed we are in terms of our support group and also the situtation we find ourselves in with Pax.... I am always reminded that someone always has it worse- not that I want them to! I don't wish those things on anyone, especially these little tender hearts housed in children. It is just such a dose of perspective every time I'm here.<br /><br />And yet, (Stop reading here if you don't want to hear a special needs mom whine - wah wah wah!)&nbsp;sometimes I am surprised by how many doctors and nurses I know here, some on a first-name/cell-phone basis, always passing in the halls or at the cafeteria, maybe embarrassed that I know them so well that I stop them when I see them even outside of a clinic appointment. I know more about this "life" up here at the hospital than I ever thought I would have. "Primary Children's Medical Center" used to be such a lofty and scary term to me, a place reserved only for where children&nbsp;went when something is seriously wrong or&nbsp;a child is seriously sick, where someone is life-flighted or taken by ambulance after some life-threatening,&nbsp;horrible accident (both of which we have&nbsp;done <i>more</i> than once). It is out-of-body like to realize this has become such a continuous reality for us, a process we know more than we would like. I know most of the guards, cafeteria workers, same-day surgery workers, hospitalists, and the head of almost every specialty/department.&nbsp;Um, is this my life?! A couple weeks ago I got to go to a girls' night and we stopped at TJMaxx afterwards, ooh yes, and as a friend was holding something up for me to see, I realized how sad it was that in deciding if I liked the cute sweater, I was picturing myself in a doctor's office and walking up and down the halls, maybe in and out of the cafeteria, <i>at PCMC</i>..."Would that be comfortable, simple, cute...?" Ah! PATHETIC!<br /><br />I cannot lie - sometimes I do miss feeling "Normal." (I hate the term, btw.) It's hard not helping in carpool, getting to know the other moms and my kids' friends as well, not being able to attend birthday lunches, dinners, and activities as often as others because I can't get a nurse for that time, taking forever to pack up and unpack the equipment, meds,&nbsp;and wheelchair to go anywhere, not having my kids signed up in every itty-bitty sport because there is no way we are making it to all of those activities, and even being left out of/not invited to things...me or my kids, and wondering if it's because they just knew I couldn't go anyway and "didn't want to make me feel bad", or maybe they didn't want to carpool my kids to that sport if I couldn't take them myself. Blah blah blah. If I do have a nurse I'm so calculated in my "hours" that I have a hard time just relaxing and doing normal things like talking to a neighbor or watching a show. I feel like I have to get done as much as possible in and out of the house in that time that I'm sure I'm missing some of what I'm supposed to enjoy just by having that break time anyway! I&nbsp;worry constantly about Paxton and his needs, his therapies, medicines, emotions, attention, and yet my other boys need it just as much, if not more, and yet it is often harder to give it to them. (Because they are the whiny, fighting ones, you know, and Pax, albeit needs and all, is just sweet and silent! Although sometimes I do want to take his sat monitor our for shooting practice.) We are constantly checking the monitor, starting and stopping food and meds, suctioning, trading on and off, and packing him up and downstairs to be with us.<br /><br />Enough! I am grateful he is not vent-dependent. I am grateful he is playful and interactive and oh-so-smiley. I am grateful we have home nurses!! I am grateful I have an amazing husband who really lives to make us happy and spend time together, and who helps me a ton with the kids and the home. I'm grateful for our helper, Crystal, who is amazing and helps me with more than I deserve!! I'm grateful for my mom who is completely trained with Paxton and helps out whenever she can and probably does a better job playing with him than I do! I'm grateful for sweet neighbors who call and text and ask me if they can come get a Paxton-fix for a couple of hours (while I get a break, too)- Love! I'm grateful for KIND therapists who are gentle and yet so helpful in pushing me and Paxton to work harder. I'm grateful for amazing insurance and for the amazing Stephanie Carlson who took her trach-vented, oxygen-dependent, g-tube fed child to our state's capitol day after day until they recognized her need for help, and then created the Blessed Travis C. Waiver that gives these technology-dependent kiddos in Utah some respite and help. I'm grateful for my counselor, Wendy, who comes every two weeks for two hours to talk to me about all the challenges that are common to these families with special needs and chronic health conditions, who helps me feel normal (in this category), buoys me up, and instructs me where she thinks I can do better. So many pieces of all the good things that help us get through the day-to-day. I'm grateful for the Mormon Channel, I LOVE listening to the Conference talks and hearing the words from the speakers' voice, as it was given; listening to "Enduring it well" and "Conversations"... There are so many amazing and inspiring people out there that help me to count my blessings and buck up a bit on my drives to and from Primary's. I'm grateful for the people I have met at PC, the other trach/gtubes/SN moms I know. For their blogs, their courage to go and do and move and multiply! Nothing gets these mamas down. Well, I know it does, but they get back up so gracefully and what seems like quickly, we all would never know it. They make it look easy. I'm grateful for neighbors that bring my family food when we are at the hospital, and that drive up to visit us and put a smile on our face in Paxton's room. There is so much MORE to be grateful for! It far outweighs the hard. Plus, I know we all have our own hards, this is just ours. Yours may be private, big or small right now, but they are there, and will be there.<br /><br />I was grateful to hear these words yesterday from <a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith?lang=eng" target="_blank">Elder Neil L.

Hope. Perspective. Faith. Service. Diligence. Stillness. Activity. Blessings. Happiness. Closeness. What Matters Most. Family. Dreams. Little Victories. Medicine. Knowledge. Skills. Sacrifice. Being Brave. Doing Our Best. In all things giving Thanks to God. Prayer. Priesthood Power. Fasting. Desires. Learning learning learning.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">I feel like everyday we are learning something new. Or learning the same thing, again, whether I want to or not. You have helped me to learn oh so much about myself. About priorities. About <i>choosing</i>. About submitting. About seeking.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">We have a bond that is deep and true, intrinsically knowing each other and how to communicate one with another, without spoken words. I love every part of your body and soul. You are a miracle in every fashion and form. A gift from God to teach us more what He is like, about His Love. A gift to help us focus and become what we can become. How our life has changed with you in it. The struggles have been great. But the blessings are greater. I am grateful for this gift. For the gift you are and all of the joy, learning, people, and growth you have brought into our lives. You have made me aware of things that I knew nothing about. That I did not know were so important, or difficult, for others. You have stretched our capacities and our compassion. You have exhibited more faith and strength than any of us could muster at any age. You are a saint for being here and submitting to an imperfect body, all to have the experience of mortal life, and I know, to bless us with all that you have to teach us. We are so grateful for your time here, everyday. Even with the sacrifices, and the "hards", you know we wouldn't have it any other way. With your perfect innocence you are molding us to be better people. Inspiring us. Reminding us. Lifting us. Loving us! Oh, how we love you!!! Thank you for your example of faith, mildness, simplicity, joy, and endurance. You are teaching us more than we could ever teach you.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">I love to see you tilt your head back with laughter and glee when you are so happy. Usually from an interaction with us, seeing a toy you think is being silly or you are excited to play with, when we gobble your tummy and thighs and you go crazy. :) Even when you see us getting a diaper to change you, back goes the head and up goes the smile, happy as can be. You know what you like, and you know what you don't like. You kick things away when you are done with them. You will guard your face or trach if you don't want to be bothered or suctioned. You will allow it if you know it will help.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">You still smile at the angels. I have noticed now they are most with you when you are alone. I will see you laughing and smiling at the ceiling, like they are making you laugh. Who is playing peekaboo with you?! Is someone dancing in their angel whites, swishing their soft fabric over your face? You light up when they are around, and we both smile knowing that you are not alone. Mommy is grateful in those moments that I watch you from the monitor, usually when I need to finish getting something important done, and I know it is a tender grace of God that He has not left you alone. Or me either. We have been so richly blessed. You have given us strength and confidence in ourselves. To do things we never dreamed we could do.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">I'm amazed at all you have conquered, overcome. Your life is not easy but you don't know any different and you are happy most of the time. Unless you are hurting. &nbsp;You are a true champion, Paxton, and always will be, no matter what. Come what may, you are our Hero. Our Angel. Our Miracle. Our Champ. We love you, Pacman. Happy Second Birthday! ...and many more...</div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ijWPuTwSx-0/UACMCpW6WtI/AAAAAAAAAxc/DprSQsuUpW8/s1600/20120712_7534sb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ijWPuTwSx-0/UACMCpW6WtI/AAAAAAAAAxc/DprSQsuUpW8/s640/20120712_7534sb.jpg" width="426" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gKp87LTyzAA/UACMTYfWLAI/AAAAAAAAAxk/ZbhP40KZ16s/s1600/20120712_7542ec.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gKp87LTyzAA/UACMTYfWLAI/AAAAAAAAAxk/ZbhP40KZ16s/s640/20120712_7542ec.jpg" width="426" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QwsinhVc7Fg/UACLzr0FlNI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/ymu9W2ClFPQ/s1600/20120712_7431ef.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="440" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QwsinhVc7Fg/UACLzr0FlNI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/ymu9W2ClFPQ/s640/20120712_7431ef.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/1271877066491522741/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=1271877066491522741";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/1271877066491522741";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/1271877066491522741";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2012/07/i-cannot-believe-my-angel-boy-is-2.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:5;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-5107445008005010917";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-05-01T00:40:00.001-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-05-01T00:40:48.797-06:00";s:5:"title";s:7:"Longing";s:12:"atom_content";s:6772:"Ah, that is more about me than it is about Paxton. I have had such the urge to WRITE for so long. It is just so hard to do it. How do you other SNM (Special Needs Mommies) do it? For-reals?! I think about things all day, even record memos on my phone, jot things down on paper, but it is just so hard to even make my way in to this nice little seat I have here in front of my computer to get to share anything. &nbsp;I have a lot of high hopes of sharing my thoughts, so many more experiences and updates about Paxton, improvements and successes for our whole family (little victories), writing about some of our big days, all the things I'm learning, blah blah blah!<br /><br />I have had so many wonderful experiences lately. I feel like so many doors keep opening. It has literally been one thing after the next lately. If you have posted on my blog or reached out to me on FB or even sent me an email, please know that I am just (I don't like to use this phrase...what is a synonym for 'dying') to write you back! Seriously, I am so grateful and appreciate people reaching out so much. I am loving meeting new people who share similar experiences and stories and emotions. It is a great blessing to make those connections and strengthen each other. I just never get time on my computer! And if I sneak a read on my phone here or there, it's still too difficult to write back. &nbsp;So seriously, when are you mommies searching blogs and writing your own? Don't you people sleep? :) I joke but that is the only time I can get blogging done, if I sacrifice my sleep. And, usually my body wins over my brain at this hour. But I couldn't wait any longer! I need to blog. Like I said, one big thing after the next. I have a big 'thing' tomorrow morning, which I should really go get sleep for, then I hope to start making more of an effort to be on here. &nbsp;I don't assume it is for any of you. I know it is for me. But I do love to share the lessons I have learned and the solutions even physically we have come up with to help make life a little easier everyday with Paxton. So slowly but surely, simply and small, these posts will come!<br /><br />Tonight I am so thankful for a couple wonderful weeks that we have had. The weather does so much for all of us. I look back at where we were a year ago and I just COUNT MY BLESSINGS, one by one.<br /><br />Really...I literally used to take the video monitor with me to the bathroom!<br /><br />Paxton could not tolerate the 'nose' (HME) well, so we were literally stuck in his bedroom all day.<br /><br />I remember telling myself all winter that we just had to get through RSV season at home, just keep Paxton well enough to make it through the winter, then we could start to go outside again and feel the sunshine and some sanity. Well, his "triple crown" surgery on May 2, the <i>very beginning of Summer!, </i>knocked him out for what became a continual roller coaster of fevers and pneumonias until this February!!! That was HARD. Almost harder than last winter...waiting for summer to come, seeing people outside, and me still being stuck up there in that hot room doing the same things over and over again. :) Don't get me wrong, I love caring for and being with Paxton. I wouldn't trade any of what we have been through and I have learned for anything. That was not the issue...but anyone goes crazy staying in one room all day! Even the little man!<br /><br />I used to have to schedule someone to be with my kids when I would take Paxton to the doctor, and yet another person with me to drive my car so I could sit in the back with Paxton, suctioning him and trying to calm him down (bc he hated the car seat).<br /><br />Wow, we have come a long way.<br /><br />Paxton not only tolerates the nose all day, whenever, wherever now, but he is even doing so well on his speaking valve (passy-muir valve). Thank heavens for this! He does not mind the car seat now and since last Fall I have not needed another adult in the car, we can go just fine on our own. I hardly have to pull over to suction him.<br /><br />I don't have people in and out of my house all the time helping me with one thing or another. No, I actually have some privacy and independence. A lot of times now if there is more people here it is other kids playing with my boys, as it should be!<br /><br />Pax has been so much healthier since he had his Nissen surgery in January. Yes, it was an awful route to get there, but it has certainly paid off. With him being so much more healthy and at home, he has been able to grow and progress much more. I am getting so used to packing everything up and going, whether it's downstairs, to a doctor, on a walk, etc. How nice that we are not only NOT bound to that room anymore, but also not bound to even just the house. We are venturing out more and more as Paxton is able. I have just come to accept that there is no EASY way to go about taking Paxton with us, even into my room while I shower, but it's worth it. Worth it to get him out of that room and for us all to feel a little bit more normal. It just takes time. Time to unplug and pack everything up, something I might have to do several times a day as he may go back up for a nap, then out again later.<br /><br />We are still working on his sensitivity to the light (hurts his eyes because of the pressure from glaucoma); being outside is super hard on him in the daytime, but I do feel like it is better than last year as well. We have lots of baby sunglasses, hats, and even cushy goggles that we try to soften the burn for him! Some days are better than others, but I know he will get there eventually.<br /><br />We love going on our family walks/bike rides in the evening now that the weather is nice. Oh it makes me so happy and feel so normal. It's amazing how feeling more and more normal, that one little word, makes you really feel so much better. We are not normal. But that's okay. We are adjusting and we are happy! Good things are happening. It is crazy, but I do truly feel like since Conference Paxton has been doing so well!! There must be many more strangers praying for him everywhere, a lucky and happy consequence/blessing for us. I am so happy for him and of course it makes myself happy as well! So thank you for your prayers. They are always helping. My 'prayer list' has grown quite a bit as well as I have learned and gained a testimony of how important it is, how much it truly does <i>work</i>&nbsp;and help when we pray for each other. I want to help anyone I know that is struggling or needs the extra prayer in anyway. I hope it does help!<br /><br />So see, I'll end tonight where I started... How in the world do YOU busy mommies blog and is it really replacing your sleep? :) Loves and night to you all!";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/5107445008005010917/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=5107445008005010917";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/5107445008005010917";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/5107445008005010917";s:4:"link";s:61:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2012/05/longing.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:6;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-2931266378923252055";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-04-01T19:19:00.001-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-04-01T19:19:09.140-06:00";s:5:"title";s:22:"LDS General Conference";s:12:"atom_content";s:1573:"Wow.

That he could come to a family who had a link to someone who could learn and express these thoughts with many people all over the world in similar situations as us. I feel so grateful. He teaches us all so much.&nbsp;My mom joked after the session, "We need to make him a little missionary nametag of his own!" So true! We were grateful to have some of Paxton's caregivers there with us who I hope felt the Spirit of the whole conference. How could anyone not? The leader's of God's church are amazing. I am so inspired and happy, motivated and content. I can't wait to study all of these talks further.<br /><br />And even I will watch my dad's talk over and over as something different stands out each time!<br /><br />Thanks to you all for the well wishes and fun comments today.

I am the worst at getting on here. I guess I'm going for the quarterly catch-ups now. :)<br /><br />Pax is doing great. We are STILL battling all the concurrent fevers and infections, literally one right after another since May 17. BUT, we are also still seeing progression and development, which is great. I have had such joy the last few weeks in seeing Paxton really respond to certain therapies that we have worked on since coming home. It's great to see him coming along, even if it is delayed (but we expected that). About two weeks ago Paxton finally figured out how to roll all the way over, to both sides, and back. He has been rolling forever, but now, for the most part, he can get that last arm up and out from under his belly. Yippee! He is getting super strong at tummy time, and can balance himself so much better sitting up in my arms. It's delightful. &nbsp;He also is still doing fabulous on the HME/nose, meaning we can bring him downstairs on his portable equipment any time we want, and he doesn't struggle as much in the car anymore. It's liberating to be able to take him to dr's apppointments on my own (although I enjoyed the visits with Grami and neighbors who would help us in the past). I may have to pull over once or twice to suction but usually that's about it. Yay!<br /><br />I feel like we are much more really into a rythmn now and I can see all of us doing better. That first year really is survival, and I would never wish to go back to any moment of it! Pax, although still immuno-compromised with so many dr visits, surgeries on the horizon, etc. etc, is so much more stable. I am getting to the point where I can leave him, even rolling around on the floor for a minute while I run to grab his milk or throw some laundry in. And, I don't always feel like I have to be staring at the monitor every second. I can handle evenings on my own now with the three boys, even when Dave is out of town and I am trying to juggle them at dinner and bedtime. I'm not saying it's easy, but it feels good to be capable and to have our home to ourselves again, even if it is stressful and not as picture-perfect as I would like it to be. &nbsp;So much of it is attributed to what a sweetheart little Paxton is. Unless he is really hurting or needing something, he is an angel and will be content playing on the floor or in a swing while I help the other boys or get them to bed. He also - finally! - at 16 months, is starting to get into a wee bit of a schedule. I can usually rely on noon as naptime now, with a small one around dinner-time. This helps me a lot in scheduling therapies, knowing when I can count on a shower, etc. Obviously every day is not the same, but it's definitely more regular for sure.<br /><br />The contented feeling has remained. I feel such a joy in caring for my little Pacman and the rest of our clan here at home. And while sometimes I do feel the world outside may be going on without me, I am also feeling that this is my world. These boys are the cutest things to me and growing up all too fast. I'm getting to the ages with Camden and Mackay that I can really feel that some of what we are doing is okay! That we are teaching them, and despite their best efforts to make us think otherwise, they are listening! And getting it! They are gems to their brother Pax, and continue to learn how to help him with more and more things, especially how to play with and hold him. Paxton lights up when they are around and they always seem to know just what he needs. One day Pax's O2 tank was nearing empty and Camden came running to me saying, "Mom, Paxton's tank is on red and that reads BAD!" So cute for a little boy who is learning to read and while there were no words to read, he certainly was right that that meant bad! 'KK' loves to help push every syringe for Paxton, carry his chords when we go from one place to another, and they both love to make him laugh.<br /><br />Excitedly, I heard Paxton vocalize for the first time about 2 days ago. Although he used to do great on the speaking valve, like on for 30 min at a time when he first started out, interestingly enough, now he is having a more difficult time with it. :( (coughing a lot!!!) But finally, I heard these cute little high-pitched sounds for the first time and loved it! He heard them too and now is trying to make those sounds even when he is on the nose. So fun!<br /><br />I had a super uber proud mommy moment. The leaves were going. I knew it. I kept wanting to get my traditional annual Fall pictures of the boys but it seemed Davey Dew was always gone! Well finally, on a day that wasn't even particularly good, I packed everything up, got all three boys ready, hauled out the bumbo and my photo chair, my camera bag, and lastly the boys and Pax's equipment all loaded up in the double stroller, and headed to...the back yard! :) We got some really fun pictures that day and their interactions were so cute and genuine with each other. All that and it was all on my own! (Never on my own...God is always helping me.) Physically alone though. Phew! What an effort it was but I felt like it paid off and I got enough to satisfy my urge before the last of the leaves fell. I didn't quite get the smiles I wanted from Pax, but once he was just lying down in the grass and looking up at the leaves, well, then he was quite happy!<br /><br />So Happy Fall to you all... that "Most special time of the year" is just around the bend!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

It's amazing to see how his life began and how much he has improved and surprised us to this day. The Pacman has had 7 major surgeries, and numerous other visits to the OR for procedures and tests. On average, he visits 1 out of 13 specialists about 4x times a month. He is the utmost example of faith, endurance, submission, tolerance, and love, and is constantly teaching US about compassion, perspective, sacrifice, and joy. Seeing him smile is the biggest reward we could ask for and at the rate he shares his smiles, we are all feeling pretty satisfied.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">To celebrate his big day, we had quite the 'open house' for Paxton, 'The Champ'. We were overwhelmed at everyone who came to show their love and support, some to meet Paxton for the first time. So many have prayed for Paxton and served our family in our time of difficulty, and we felt it was important to share that day with many of those very special people. Paxton sure came to a good support group, that's for sure. From family to friends and neighbors, he has a pretty greatly stacked house. </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Pax was a trooper for his little get together. Since my last post, Paxton has continued to have fever after fever, infection after infection. Mostly pnuemonias. Well, he had gotten another one the day after his birthday, two days before his party. We decided to have it anyway and Pax was just a calm little bug. He didn't show any of his great smiles for the party, so I think he did sense the crowd, which is something he is definitely not used to. But of course, he was smiling again when our house turned back into the little place he is so accustomed to. I'm so grateful to my mom, my cousin, and several special freinds who made the party look so fabulous and helped restock the food, take pictures, and basically keep things going.

Yes, there were times that were very hard to relax, and we had a tough time feeling like we should really be there anyway, but all in all we enjoyed each other's company, great food, the sun and sand and waves and amazing turtles and views, snow cones, pina coladas, sunsets, taking pictures, adventures such as zip lines, kayaking and hiking barefoot through a jungle-ish canyon to swim in hidden waterfalls, jumping off waterfalls and rope swings, body surfing, surfing, long boarding, etc. Like I said, Wow.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vS15QQuVkNU/TktYWDvUYQI/AAAAAAAAAsw/WUVAOXjP60I/s1600/IMG_6940.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vS15QQuVkNU/TktYWDvUYQI/AAAAAAAAAsw/WUVAOXjP60I/s320/IMG_6940.jpg" width="213" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2R7DV2rSFXs/TktYptbTO-I/AAAAAAAAAs0/ze-GxHX1nac/s1600/IMG_7073e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2R7DV2rSFXs/TktYptbTO-I/AAAAAAAAAs0/ze-GxHX1nac/s320/IMG_7073e.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P9UaPWEQSFo/TktY8AZjjMI/AAAAAAAAAs4/aQ6PAHgIQi0/s1600/IMG_7803.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P9UaPWEQSFo/TktY8AZjjMI/AAAAAAAAAs4/aQ6PAHgIQi0/s320/IMG_7803.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">That was a mighty thanks to this hot couple, Grami and Pa, who provided an incredible vacation to celebrate Pa's birthday.

Dave and I came home very restored and ready to welcome back our life again. In fact, I was excited to come home to it. And not in a naive, grass-is-always-greener kind of way. Being away helped me to realize even more what a blessing I have of caring for my sweet family. It is really an honor to have Paxton, and Camden and Mackay, in our lives, in our family, and I just wanted to come home and be the best mom to them. Even neater is that I feel like I have done a pretty good job since then! Yeah. For being pretty hard on myself, that feels SOOO good. ...</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">It's amazing how sometimes you can pray and pray for things and they won't come to pass because obviously the Lord knows what's best and it's not His will at that time. But throughout this last year I have also experienced several very distinct instances where it hasn't taken all the many prayers to help something come to pass, but rather, it's been the one, truly-fervent-deep and sincere-desire prayers that have made all the difference.&nbsp;</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I hope it is okay that I share this, and I do so because I think it's such a good reminder to us all that our Father in Heaven is there and ready to grant us blessings to sincere and earnest desires that are good and 'expedient' to us. Upon arriving home from our trip, and after months of feeling sad and tired of still needing so many people's help and looking for a paid 'helper', I plead to the Lord with newfound resolve to "Please, Magnify Me." I can honestly say that I have wanted to do so much more on my own for months and months. It is not an easy thing or a fun position to be in to be constantly needing and asking people for help. There have been many days that I have tried to 'do things on my own', but at some point, I am maxed out, have lost my patience with boys who are bored and need attention to their young minds and bodies (as well as Pax) and don't understand why they need to wait another minute. Those days were always just so hard and although I always wanted to be all of their full-time mom, I just felt I couldn't do it well enough to save all of our sanity. Well, I really really really wanted to be done with that. They are my kids. I want to be with them 100% of the time. Getting home I was determined to not rely on others. I was determined to either find a way to make it doable and healthy for all of us, or pay someone to help me. No more favors everywhere. The good news? My heartfelt prayer was heard!! I have been amazed and so happy at all that we have done on our own the last couple of weeks. There are moments, yes, but I am still so happy to be the one and only at home with my boys, disciplining and loving them, etc. Just feeling capable to run my home and family again the way I have wanted to and not felt able to for the last year. It has almost been so good the last few weeks that I wonder why it was so hard before, and have we really reached our "new normal"? Could we be exiting the "survival stage" of the first year that everyone talks about?</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I know it is better for many reasons. For one, I can literally FEEL the Lord magnifying me and helping me to do what I want to do and what I need to do but cannot do alone. He has made my burdens lighter, manageable, made me calmer and more patient, more grateful and more content. It has been wonderful! Paxton has also been in such a better place. I used to not be able to bring him downstairs without him huffing and puffing and crying. Same with the car seat. Lately (after Paxton was on the vent for 6.5 weeks for 24 hours a day to help him recover from pnuemonias and collapsed lungs) he has been transitioning to the "nose" amazingly well! We used to always have him on the trach mask, confining us to his room, and being on the vent was even worse. We were confined for 2 months to that CORNER of the room. Insanity! But we have climbed to the top of that mountain and are finally enjoying a beautiful view! Right now, after Paxton has his morning cares and things, I basically put him on the nose and head downstairs for the day with the boys. I'm also getting so used to unplugging and replugging everything several times a day, carrying his stuff downstairs to play or back upstairs for a nap, back and forth. It's just becoming so much more second nature. This has been a goal of mine for months and I am so happy we are here (more portable), at least for now. I know Paxton is likely to have setbacks again, but also he is older and stronger and able to tolerate more things. He still can't really go outside during the day. We try but it's just too bright for him. Dusk is perfect though and we try to enjoy our backyard or even a walk around the block before sunset. I can't believe I'm even saying that. Just in June I tried taking Paxton on a walk around the block and we did not make it a blip. I feel so much freedom all of a sudden!</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So, we have moved mountains and milestones and are all enjoying this bit more normal life. We have also ventured out with Paxton on several quick outtings in just the last month. Paxton has loved all of them with the exception of one - a boat - for a quick ten minute test drive so we thought it would be a good trial. I really think the biggest problem was it was still too bright in the evening. But I'm not in a hurry to try that again! However, Paxton has LOVED these little trips:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;

The first week was rough. When Paxton first woke up he was in miserable, swollen, bloody shape (read: PAIN). It was awful to see him hurt so much and try to do anything to help him feel better. The poor little guy could just barely stand to be awake, so he spent most of his time sleeping, waking up just to writhe, squirm, and cry until the next pain med could be administered and kick in. When we came back home from the hospital 3 days later, it was so cute, I put Paxton down in his crib, and he gave as much of a smile and kick that he could before taking a 3 hour nap....He was happy to be back home!<br /><div><br /></div><div>About two weeks after all of his surgeries, just as Paxton was beginning to feel a little back to normal, he got aspiration pneumonia. We went from one two-week setback to another. The last two weeks have been constant fevering, trips to Drs., hospitals, and the ER. We prefer caring for Pax at home and,&nbsp;fortunately,&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;him&nbsp;here,&nbsp;even&nbsp;though&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;wondered&nbsp;at&nbsp;times&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;did&nbsp;the&nbsp;right&nbsp;thing.&nbsp;His lungs have been a wrecking ground.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;hoping&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;mend&nbsp;now&nbsp;as&nbsp;he&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;fever&nbsp;free&nbsp;the&nbsp;last&nbsp;two&nbsp;days.&nbsp;I miss the rolling, happy, energetic Pax we know! Last night we had a glimpse of that so I'm hoping for good things to come.</div><div><br /></div><div>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;happier&nbsp;note,&nbsp;while I thought Paxton's oral aversion would be worse after having a prosthetic palate screwed into his mouth, ironically, his oral aversion has significantly decreased. It makes me wonder if it might have bothered him to even just open his mouth before, if even the air coming in was uncomfortable. A week ago his thumb finally made its way to his mouth, chewing, exploring, and smiling all the way. This was a happy moment! Something so normal and purposeful and good. Because of how often he began doing it, I started trying to give him a bottle and he did better than any other time we have tried in the past. I got a little reprimanding for doing that without a clearance from a doctor (excuse me for being an excited, normal mom, right?). So we had our swallow study this week (feeding him a bottle under video xray to see what happens with the fluid, and if his epiglottis can indeed close off his airway when he swallows so he doesn't aspirate). Luckily, they confirmed that, at least there, there was no sign of anything going down 'the wrong way'. So, approval granted! Mom can be a mom again and work on feeding! Can you believe it?! I feel like I am graduating right along with Paxton. Just this week we have gone from having Occupational and Vision therapists, to now adding in Feeding and Physical Therapists. Hallelujia. It feels so natural to see a bottle in his mouth and I have GREAT HOPES that it will become something comfortable and possible for him.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>He is also progressing in his physical strength and abilities. Only a special needs parent (no offense to the others :) knows the extreme JOY that comes from seeing your child get stronger everyday, especially when it is something you have to work at so hard just to do something so small and normal that we mostly take for granted. To wobble a little less when upright, to lift his head higher off the floor at tummy time, to roll to one side of his body, after working on these things for 6 MONTHS it is a happy thing to see some progress! Yippee Paxton!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Although this month has been a rough one for Paxton, since my last DREARY post (sorry about that), I feel like Paxton has improved so much. &nbsp;He is still 13 lbs. but loves rolling all over a room (in his own cute way), he is stronger in all ways, including that he does so much better on the "nose" (his filter that goes over his trach and hooks to his oxygen tank when we go out of his room, away from his three machines that produce oxygen and humidity), which has made things a world better. Although it is A LOT of work to pack up everything, if Paxton is feeling good, we can now bring him downstairs to roll on the floor there, have a lovely ride in his favorite swing, sit on mom and dad's lap for a meal (oh my goodness just this is something I LOVE being able to do...so simple), or try going outside with him. I say try because Paxton is so sensitive to light (because he is not used to the full outdoor light, and because his galucoma makes his eyes so much more sensitive). Most of the time, even in the shade with his wide-brimmed hat and baby sunglasses, he "shuts down"- just closes his eyes and turns in to me- &nbsp;BUT, it is getting better. It is all GETTING BETTER. What a thrill and blessing. I do still have days that I just want to pretend life was normal and I could just go hop off with my kids and do whatever fun summer thing I wanted, like I used to, but...it's okay. That's not what life is and I'm still very grateful for the life and family I have. And just so grateful there is improvement. There are shining moments and tender mercies and many happinesses that come from what we are doing. And when I can let other things go, I know this is all the most important stuff right here. And my kids won't suffer too much if they go a year or two without all the activities and lessons that could be had. Before we know it Pax will be two and I can't wait to see how much things have changed. (Uh, ok, I hope some things do!) Right now just knowing he is almost one is crazy. And exciting. And so awesome.</div><div><br /></div><div>This last Monday was a great day for us as a family. Although the holiday started rainy (surprise), the sun peeked out and we were feeling adventurous. While it sounds so boring, like why would this be our FIRST OUTTING ANYWHERE AS A FAMILY (not to a doctor, of course), it was important and meaningful to us. I can say that we have felt strongly that Paxton has had many angels supporting and comforting him so many times this past year, if not daily, and it's easy to think that if he were to have angels tending to him at times, that it would probably be some of our close relatives on the other side. What a special day it was for us to go to the gravesides of my grandparents and thank them for their probable presence this last year. They were (are) all amazing people and taught us so much about faith and love and family. What was even better was that Pax did SO WELL. Many times that we take him out of his room, or especially go in the car, he really struggles. But he was so peaceful, happy, and easy. (If you saw us you would laugh that I just said easy.) It was just so fun for us to be together as a family of five, going somewhere in the car just because we wanted to, and not worrying about the other half or having to hurry back or whatever. I think Pax really enjoyed being outside that day. :)</div><div><br /></div><div>So good things. I'm very grateful. I feel like with the winter, a bit of my clouds have lifted and I'm feeling like more of the person I was before. It's just so great to add in some simple normalcies of life. I admire families so much who just keep moving forward and make things happen regardless of their circumstances. They make it look easy but we don't see how difficult it may be for them, or may have been in the beginning. I thought about this all one day as I was home alone with the three boys, trying to make dinner but I literally couldn't put Paxton down. I was holding him in one arm, wheeling the oxygen tank with the other arm, to and from the fridge, getting one item and walking it to the counter, and back and forth over and over. It was very frustrating and a little depressing. I thought about all those amazing people who lose their limbs and we see them all over YouTube- how much they have learned to do and now they are out motivating others and living these happy, full lives. I wondered...How did they get there? Were there days they just wanted to break down and quit, give up, at least cry a whole freaking lot? I think there had to have been. It just gave me strength to keep moving forward in this life of mine, and made me count my blessings in that moment. When I was about to break down and cry I had an ah-hah moment and literally thanked God for my arms and hands!! 'Cause I don't know how those people do what they do, but this, I can do this. (Gratefully I had a laugh that night when a friend came over and said, "Man, you know you've had a bad day when you are grateful you have arms!") but it's so true, I think we all have so many blessings to count! And I count the challenges as great blessings, too, because they make us care about the whys and the hows of this life and make us better people.</div><div><br /></div><div>So we are doing great. I hope to post some pictures soon.&nbsp;</div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/6572242718263708230/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=6572242718263708230";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/6572242718263708230";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/6572242718263708230";s:4:"link";s:68:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2011/06/moving-forward.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:10;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-4501221554107799300";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-05-02T10:57:00.001-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-05-02T11:05:01.823-06:00";s:5:"title";s:11:"Surgery Day";s:12:"atom_content";s:1487:"<p class="mobile-photo"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paz9YppAJvA/Tb7jJ-RyqXI/AAAAAAAAAqc/DM9UHziLuDs/s1600/photo%2B1-723249.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-paz9YppAJvA/Tb7jJ-RyqXI/AAAAAAAAAqc/DM9UHziLuDs/s320/photo%2B1-723249.JPG"  border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5602164746971425138" /></a></p><p class="mobile-photo"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-McDj84mjabQ/Tb7jKYsL1MI/AAAAAAAAAqk/yOdIeIY1pBg/s1600/photo%2B2-724753.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-McDj84mjabQ/Tb7jKYsL1MI/AAAAAAAAAqk/yOdIeIY1pBg/s320/photo%2B2-724753.JPG"  border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5602164754061448386" /></a></p><p class="mobile-photo"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kB-f2N-rbsc/Tb7jKllCTgI/AAAAAAAAAqs/vKsDYlR5aN0/s1600/photo%2B3-725984.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kB-f2N-rbsc/Tb7jKllCTgI/AAAAAAAAAqs/vKsDYlR5aN0/s320/photo%2B3-725984.JPG"  border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5602164757521124866" /></a></p>Paxton on his way into a triple crown surgery this morning- 1st cleft palate repair and prosthetic palate placed, ear tubes, and a urology operation. check-in bright and early at 6am.

A more updated post to follow soon.)<br /><br />Ahh to resign from my three month blogging sabbattical. To be honest, I was not sure if I would be able to blog again. Life has taken on quite a new schedule, none of which lends too freely to blogging. Or any extra curricular activity for that matter, for the time being. Really, that is what has kept me going through most of this- knowing that there are many times and seasons in life, and right now, this season is wholly devoted to very simple things. Caring for Paxton. Caring for my boys. Caring for my marriage. Caring for my home - not so much. :) All get the front seat when they can and sometimes the back seat is the best I can do. But we are here, carrying on. How to organize the madness of my thoughts? The lessons learned, difficulties of the adjustment, blessings abounding, pleas for ____, a myriad of things...<br /><br />First I should share about Paxton.<br /><br />Paxton has been uber blessed being home. We both love being here. &nbsp;Going back to the hospital now is a very hard thing for both of us. The sterile, cold environment...where suddenly mom is the expert and has to tell the nurses what to do and when to do them is...weird. With that said, it's not like I go anywhere. I have a very hard time not being with Paxton when he is in the hospital. I feel like he knows and is comforted by his mom, and leaving him alone in this boring, lonely place would be such a blow to his normal little world. Why give him one more thing to struggle with in a not so happy place? So I stay with him as much as possible.<br /><br />Paxton has been back to the hospital for many specialty checkups and several sick checks...the first of which, after being home for a month, we realized his lungs were deflated. He was admitted for a week and put back on a ventilator at nights. This felt like a step backwards, but they had no question it would be better for him. It is more work: more to hook up at night, more alarms, etc., but at the same time, it does help him in many ways. It helps his lungs, his apnea, and his growth, so he is not exerting so much energy and calories to keep breathing, allowing his body to really restore itself at night. He is growing. He is now at 7 months, 11.5 lbs.!<br /><br />Paxton has done some great things that have surprised me. He thankfully has his Daddy's coordination. He can reach and grab a toy hanging from his mobile after carefully watching it advance to the right position. He bats at toys and reaches up and holds the books I read to him. He also rolls to his right side from his back freely, back and forth, with huge grins after each roll. His head control has gotten better but his upper body strength is still lacking a bit. I get a thrill out of noticing what he intentionally does and does not do. I used to think all of his movements were completely erratic, and maybe they were, but now I know they are very intentional. Paxton will move his arms or legs to feel something as much as he wants, and can now keep them perfectly still if there is something he does not want any more of as well. He has a hard time concentrating, or looking at, anything when he is sitting up; he is much more used to examining things from a back-lying perspective. So we always have a lot to work on when we can. However, worrying about his reflux every hour of the day really puts a damper on what we can do: work, play, and therapy-wise. Paxton would like to be doing more, sitting up or laying flat more (he is beginning to get a little bored), but it's hard having to keep him at a 40 degree angle so much of the time to prevent reflux. (And it still happens much of the time regardless.) It is not safe (risk of aspiration) and not fun for him to be suctioned -nose and trach- after.<br /><br />Paxton loves hearing a familiar voice and any sounds that his two older brothers make. Likewise how much his older brothers love to get down and play with him, kiss him on his forehead, hold his little hands, and play action figures over his head. They like to hold him at times and always want to come see if Paxton is awake and wanting to be part of their play. I've been so impressed at their care and sensitivity to him. They have never tried to pull anything they shouldn't, and they understand way too much about things that have never been said.&nbsp;They know that their baby brother always needs someone with him.&nbsp;Camden will say, "Mom, I'll stay here and take care of Paxton, you just go find ____ for me." Well I have actually said, "Okay, Camden," and while watching on the video monitor will find that sweet little 4 year old, rubbing his baby brother's head saying, "It's okay, Paxton, I got 'cha."<br /><br />One day the boys came home from church with deliciously large gumballs, and Camden was so excited to show me and Paxton. It was fascinating to watch Camden's wheels turning as he looked at the gumball, then Paxton, then me, and asked, while putting the gumball to Paxton's tummy, "Mom, can this fit in Paxton's tube?" So cute! I loved that he wanted to share it with him and knew exactly where it would go. Camden wants to help me mix Paxton's milk and do anything else he can.&nbsp;The boys love to help me bathe him. Camden will put the shampoo on his head and massage his scalp while Mackay is famous for rubbing the washcloth all over him. Mackay gets mad at me every time I suction Paxton because Paxton doesn't like it. He will say each word with the maddest face and stern pointing finger, "No, no, Mommy, be nice a Paxton. No owies."<br /><br />At the beginning of January, Paxton spiked a 105 degree fever and his heart rate got up to 187 bpm. I double dosed his anti-seizure med and we headed to Primary's in the middle of the night. At first they supposed pneumonia, then a viral infection, then by day three we were down to thinking it was simply a reaction to the flu shot. Thankfully. But from that visit we learned he was anemic and needed iron supplements three times a day. So things always work out as they should.<br /><br />Paxton's eye exams have been great and his pressures are remaining low. Hallelujia!<br /><br />Other than that, I really feel Paxton's immunity is growing. We have had head colds and so has he, and luckily nothing has ever settled in his chest so much that it didn't go away on its own. This has been a huge blessing to us and his continued growth. But every time a new cold emerges, we get very worried and hope it will go away like the last one. Such is the case right now and last weekend we did labs, xray, and RSV swab, but so far so good.<br /><br />Nursing from our insurance ended, but, without saying exactly what happened (who knows what psychos are out there), let's just say God's hand has been working His way in our circumstances and amazingly, the very same week, we were able to be part of a program that will allow Paxton to have continued nursing at night. It goes without saying what a miracle and how happy I am, right?!!! But really, it is pretty amazing if you knew all of the details. It is nothing but a huge TENDER MERCY and blessing from our Heavenly Father and we are SO GRATEFUL! And we finally have consistent nurses who we love and trust and they love Paxton. What a blessing! Oh to be able to sleep at night! (Well I do have two other toddlers but you know what I mean.) &nbsp;:) &nbsp;It makes a huge difference from the nights I have to stay up on my own after a full day, and go again the next! We are VERY grateful!<br /><br />People ask me how I do this all the time. How I'm doing. Two different answers. How we do this - The answer is simple, although doing it is not. The Lord/Gospel/Our beliefs, and Others' help. How we are actually doing? Loaded. Most of the time I can honestly say pretty good. But I have felt the urge lately to try to do more on my own, have less help daily, and while it is good for our family to learn how to do so, of course it is MUCH more difficult, trying, and tiring. It's hard on our two little boys, who have a hard time not doing more things and in more places ALL DAY LONG. It's hard on me going constantly one thing to the next with the kids but also being essentially stuck in the same place all day everyday. &nbsp;I want so badly to be able to do it all by myself, but it is very hard to do. My back literally aches about half way through the day, and I feel like I need some advil every night before bed. I feel like it's a constant question running through my head how to do all of this, more and more on my own everyday. I want to not only be Paxton's full-time Mom, but Camden and Mackay's, too. How to do both full-time right now remains a mystery. And it's not an easy idea to hire a nurse for Paxton or help for the boys. I struggle with essentially every idea we have thought of. I know it will continue to come, just as blending other things has, but I don't think it will be a quick solution.<br /><br />This last week we had an interesting experience. I was home with the three boys, and Dave had just taken off on a plane and a very huge storm was brewing outside. He had said he had a pit in his stomach all day to leave, and it always makes you wonder, does that mean something is going to go wrong...to him, to Paxton? Moments after his phone was turned off, the lights in Paxton's room flickered. It was so quick, I'm sure anyone else would not have thought a thing about it. But a moment later I had a feeling, 'The lights are going to go off... The POWER is going to go off!' I ran downstairs to get candles and flashlights, batteries, and matches. I felt myself rushing around on adrenaline as I panicked, what else do we need if the power goes out?! Of course we have a generator but had not set it up yet, and you never think it will all happen just the moment your husband has boarded a plane. Then I laughed at and got mad at myself for creating all of this drama, saying to myself, "Shannon, why are you making this such a big deal? The lights are probably not going to go out and then you will have stressed out and made it an anxious night for nothing!" Literally 3 minutes later, it went out. The whole house. (IE: ALL OF PAXTON'S EQUIPMENT, monitors, etc.) I pulled the boys off the counter and ran upstairs saying, "OK guys come on here we go, we have to get Paxton on his tank!" I was rushing, my heart was pounding, and I was grateful I knew how many clicks it took to turn on Paxton's oxygen tank in the dark. Camden came into the room and asked, "Mommy, is Paxton going to die?" I said, "No, Camden, of course not, we just need to take good care of him together, okay?" We got candles and flashlights out, Mackay was crying and scared, and even when we kneeled to say a prayer Mackay was shining the lights out in the hallway crying, "Bad guy, Mommy, Bad guy." I knew Paxton would be okay on the O2 tank, even though he doesn't like it much. He was crying already but if I needed to I could give him a med to cope for the night. I called the power company and the outage was expected to last at least 5 hours. I knew we could get by on tanks that long, but what about the suction machine, and pulse oximeter monitor? The batteries lasts 2 hours. Another scare...my cell phone battery was in the red! Lucky for me, I have, as I have said before, amazing family and neighbors. A brother in law brought a generator, a sister in law came to help with the kids, and my trained neighbor came to help at Paxton's side while we calmed and situated the kids. Another neighbor came to help. I felt completely at peace once we got the generator going and I couldn't really believe Paxton could be on all of his equipment during the outage, and there was nothing really more to worry about at all. My boys were having fun with their cousins and playing with flashlights. I'm so grateful for concerned and caring people in my life who help me not to go it alone in my toughest moments. I really do fear now where I would be mentally without them! Sometimes I really think it would be too much.<br /><br />We&nbsp;are&nbsp;doing&nbsp;as&nbsp;Elder&nbsp;Uchtdorf&nbsp;advised,&nbsp;slowing&nbsp;down&nbsp;and&nbsp;proceeding&nbsp;through&nbsp;this&nbsp;turbulent&nbsp;time&nbsp;at&nbsp;a much slower&nbsp;speed.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;much&nbsp;choice&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;matter&nbsp;either!&nbsp;But&nbsp;there is a lot of doing without right now, and as hard as some of those things are to lose (regular freedoms and to do's), it really is okay. There are other things that are not okay to lose, and we have to work really hard to make them happen, to protect our relationships, with each other and the Lord. Is it the same struggle of balance as it was before? In principle, yes; in all actuality, not at all. It is much more intense. More constantly difficult. And I know we are doing our best. But even then the bow can't always be tight, and there are moments I simply want to escape. &nbsp;Yes, it is absolutely a huge blessing to have Paxton home and a part of our lives, and WE LOVE HIM WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS, but it's still hard to deal with how things are day to day, everyday. I wish everyday that Paxton could be weaned from oxygen. It would make such a huge difference in the equipment we would have to carry everywhere, the worry that goes with every minute, and the constant monitoring, both of machines and humans! It would make him so much more portable and life a little more normal for our family. I feel like we are always learning more on the horizon, surgeries or therapies, and it's not always comforting. The long road is starting to set in and I suppose it has affected my cheery temperament just a bit. But I do know that I can be thankful for so many blessings. So many caring people in our lives who have brought meals, babysat my boys, driven me and Paxton to doctors, cleaned our home, shoveled our walks, called, and visited. I would not be surprised if when I go to the other side Someone says to me, "You know you were the most blessed trach mom ever, right?" I don't think many others have the outpouring of service that we have had. We have amazing family, neighbors, and friends who have tried to be there in every way physically and emotionally possible. And we are so grateful. I really think I would have jumped off a cliff by now. Because just now, as I try to do more on my own, I definitely feel more of the weight. Of labor and loneliness. And I think of other moms and families with special needs children who live away from family, don't have such an aware or caring community, and feel like they have been given this huge challenge to deal with all on their own and I just don't know how they do it. I hope they have the Lord in their lives because ultimately He is the only one who can get us all through any of our difficult trials, our refiner's fires- some once given that will remain for most, if not all, of our lives. I pray everyday for myself, my family, and others with these trials that we can do it. That we will become what He knows we can be and that we can be what we need to for each other. If you know anyone, besides me, that struggles with a special needs child or family member, please, please, go help them! Ask what you can do. Visit. Call them when you can. I hope you would feel as blessed as they would from your love.<br /><br />And today, just enjoy running an errand, whenever and wherever you want. Driving by yourself in the car without another adult or without it being on your way to the hospital. Playing with your kids in the basement or taking them outside to feel the warmer weather and light on their face. There are so many things I wish we could do and can't wait for the time we will be able to do them more again. With that all said, I count my many blessings everyday that Paxton is here and we have such an amazing support group. Thank you for being a part of it!";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/2523911272990870243/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=2523911272990870243";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/2523911272990870243";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/2523911272990870243";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2011/04/return.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:12;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-6590223072376915817";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-11-28T17:36:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2010-11-28T17:36:41.321-07:00";s:5:"title";s:29:"Grateful for Our Angel Paxton";s:12:"atom_content";s:7566:"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I'm so excited to post today. Our hearts have been so full this THANKSGIVING. I'm amazed at the blessings that have been ours this year. Of all of the learning, growth, awakening, appreciating, accepting, and enduring we have all experienced. We have been such recipients of great love... Of others' service, support, and prayers, and of our own little bundle of joy and the love he expresses and engenders. We have been blessed with capable and experienced doctors, nurses, and specialists. We have great insurance! We have the best family in the world, helping somewhat almost everyday. Caring neighbors and friends checking in constantly. Technology that can keep our son alive (and loads of electricity to power it)! Grateful for a shower. To walk down to get the mail. For yummy food. My fireplace. Hot chocolate. Heat. My boys! My hubby. Our family family family. And of course I hate to be cheesy or over-expressing of it all, but I am so grateful for the scriptures, and for my Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. I'm amazed at the the Plan and the all encompassing power, healing, and love they bestow. Trials are always hard but are so good, too, even when you are in them. I have loved coming closer to Them and knowing Them better, myself better, and learning how They can help us do all things... Amazing!!! Amazing the trust they place in us, but even better than that, how They help us to do whatever they ask of us. I have harder days ahead but do believe nothing is impossible. Hard, tiring? Yes. I always get caught in the anxiety and fear of being physically left alone to handle all of this, which I don't need to do until it happens, but even then, I just need to constantly remind myself I will NEVER BE ALONE. It's hard to wrap my head around that concept sometimes but I have had even small moments already where I have learned how powerful that is. As much as another pair of hands, His comfort and understanding are enough to get me through, and even more than that, to revitalize me. </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So I am one blessed mama. Paxton continues to do well at home, adjusting to our new "fluora" of germs that are different at home than in the hospital; tolerating therapy and noise and other activities here fairly well. Yes, he has his hard moments and days, too, and times I think maybe he is getting sick. But overall, he is still here and not at the hospital or somewhere else so so far it's a home run! </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Last night I was able to finish something I have been working on for a while (since well before Paxton came home). Something I've only been able to chip away at here and there when all of the kids have been taken care of (rare...this requires 2 other adults to be with the other children) or asleep. I have always loved photography and my own version of making videos. It started in high school. And while most of the pictures I have taken these last 5 months have been anything but professional and perfectly lit, they have been meaningful. Many are just with our phones. But it doesn't matter. I wanted to make something for our family that would summarize a bit of this time of Paxton's life. His story. What he has been through and overcome. He is a champ and inspiration in all regards. Not just superman, but a true hero to us. We could make a poster about <i>him</i>! What a fighter. With such a noble and valiant spirit. I almost feel guilty he was sent to us. That we get such a blessing of having him in our family to teach us everyday. His brothers love and look up to him and besides his physical 'owies', don't know anything is different about him. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not sure I believe there is either. He keeps defying the odds everyday. Now that I am home with him and doing things I have done with my other babies (Thank Heaven!!), I feel, in many ways, he is just like my other babies were. With that said, it will always be okay with me if he is not. I am happy for every achievement and normalcy he will experience, as it will probably only make his life better and happier. But maybe not. These special spirits have a lot to tell us about what makes one happy. We have a lot to learn!</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So I'm so excited to share some of what we have experienced with our Angel Paxton thus far. It has been a difficult but great journey and one that we are so happy has turned out so well. I believe Paxton's story could have gone either way, and still always could, but he has been magnificently impacted by all of the prayers he has had offered in his behalf. Heaven has definitely shined on him, our Star, our Angel, and us.</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">This video is certainly special for many reasons, but one that must have special mention, is that the third and final song was created for Paxton, by a dear friend of our family, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/hope.charissa">Hope Charissa</a>. She is an amazing artist, singer, and songwriter, but to me, has just always been a cherished friend. I love her very much and cry every time I even THINK of the words she wrote for our family about Paxton. They touch my soul so deeply and I (and she) know- she was absolutely inspired when she wrote the words to this song. They are beautiful and I wish all of the pictures fit into her song, as every one was so perfect for her words! Thank you, Hope. The way you have blessed our family with your talent and friendship will always be a treasure! I hope one day it is "out there" for all of the other families who know their 'special' children were sent just for them, too. The last line of your song says it perfectly! I love you!</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">And we love you, Paxton.

Every day has held new 'experiences' and things alike, too. We've had our ups and downs at home as well, but certainly overall are SO HAPPY TO BE HOME. It is not a light blessing to have Paxton here in our home with us, and inside I am amazed he is coping so well. It's so wonderful not having to leave our other boys everyday and have to drive the 50min to Primary's and back. It's nice to take turns and "come and go" from his room as we need to, instead of once only a day. With the blessings of being home have also come some new challenges, which we share with a grain of salt as our gratitude for this BIGGEST blessing is foremost in our minds and hearts.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Tuesday was an exciting and nerve-wracking day. I woke up actually a bit sick as I realized I was much more nervous than had yet occurred to me. Once at the hospital, things actually went pretty quickly because there was nothing else to check off our going home list! That was great and, again, more scary, too! It was really almost time to leave - to be gone - from all of these wonderful and full-time caretakers. Ah!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton had a tough time at first- being in the car seat and on his "artificial nose" for his trach (the portable version of his humidity and oxygen) was a lot harder for him. He started turning blue and we wondered if this was really going to happen or not! Then we realized only one of his switches on his portable oxygen was turned on! Um ya, glad we learned that little trick there! Then after all of the movement of going to the car, he was very upset. We had to take him out to calm him and realized he already had a poopy diaper. I actually loved that it was something so common to any baby. I can handle that! Once calmed and back in his seat, with only suctioning a few times, Paxton was asleep and soon we were pulling up to our house! We were welcomed by family hanging balloons and banners and taking pictures. It was so exciting to bring him in and literally sit in our home holding him, safe in our arms with the fire aglow and more than one other person gathered around (NICU rules)! We were loving every minute of it. The peace lasted about 30 min. when our equipment guy came to set everything up and teach us about it all. While he was there discussing with us, our nursing company came to "admit" Paxton into their program with many questions and signatures, etc. It was a busy four hours that luckily Paxton had mostly slept through. Trying to do his first feed in the meantime was a little nerve-wracking as I was not used to calculating everything out and I had wished they had sent me home telling me exactly how to do it (it was not simple)! When he woke up he was very unhappy still being on his "nose." It was sort of a rush to get him upstairs and finish up with the companies. Finally though, he was there ...here in his room! Baby Paxton in my nursery, with our family surrounding him. We all had the biggest smiles and he was very content and mesmerized looking up at all of us, too!</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOg2y93EgiI/AAAAAAAAAps/dxBYp4EM9ds/s1600/IMG_8032.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOg2y93EgiI/AAAAAAAAAps/dxBYp4EM9ds/s320/IMG_8032.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOnWdCL8oKI/AAAAAAAAAqM/yrV-sBH-RD0/s1600/IMG_8384.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOnWdCL8oKI/AAAAAAAAAqM/yrV-sBH-RD0/s320/IMG_8384.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOnPHi1FZ_I/AAAAAAAAAqI/Yz5eOqa0yco/s1600/IMG_8221.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TOnPHi1FZ_I/AAAAAAAAAqI/Yz5eOqa0yco/s320/IMG_8221.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The rest of the night went fairly smoothly. Our first night, with our first home nurse, they sent us a sweet, awesome nurse... that smoked. It was sooo hard for me to sleep at all that night! I had so much anxiety I couldn't shut it off. It was a big enough step to have him home, not in the care of the hospital anymore, and to trust his care to someone new, but then quite another step to know that after all our disinfecting he was surrounded now by smoke! Needless to stay, I stayed up all night watching the video monitor and because of my sleepless night, I woke up a little stuffy and had to wear a mask for 3 days! Not the funnest in your own home but we will pay any price to keep our little babe healthy!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Thanks to the help of our dear family and 24-hour nursing for the first 48 hours, a lot of time was spent getting all of Paxton's supplies and schedule organized and in my head. We literally had boxes dropped off when he got here and had a lot of sorting to do, including rearranging his room a bit to accommodate his machines and tubing. It was a little hectic at first, but I'm actually surprised how quickly it all came together. We had some follow-up appointments that Paxton struggled a bit with the car rides but eventually was calmed and back to baseline. We even managed to get in some family pictures on his 3rd day home! (Do you really think I could let that slide? Of course it was smart to do it when we had a nurse with us at the hip. :) And of course we've had stellar family continuing to help with our other boys while we are adjusting a bit to the new routine and conditions.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&nbsp;To explain what makes it a bit challenging, Paxton is supposed to be in the same room as someone at all times. Because of his trach, if he were to reflux, cry, or pull out his trach, you wouldn't be able to hear anything. The sat monitor would go off but if you were not close enough to resolve the situation immediately it could simply be too late. Personally I would like to avoid emergency CPR as much as possible! For now this means being in his bedroom with him always, and physically be looking at him every couple minutes or so (if he is not already in our arms to sleep or play of course). As he gets older we can put him on his portable equipment more often and go downstairs for part of the day, but for now, it is very hard for him to be on the portable and more difficult versions of breathing. He and I have had two brave field trips to aid in mom's sanity: to mom's shower one day that by 5:30 was a must, and to our family room for a little noise one night (aka TV) after being alone all day. Dad ended up having to travel four days this week and I most definitely would have been sunk if people weren't still helping with my other boys and stopping in to give me a verbal hello every once in a while. I'm so grateful for being close to family and having incredible neighbors and friends who care so much about us. I'm grateful for their calls and meals and just plain thinking about us. I love you all! What blessings you are in our lives!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">It is very peaceful being with Paxton all day. I actually don't mind doing what he needs at all. It is such a blessing and feels so right as his Mother. I remember the nurses saying, "Don't worry, soon you will be the expert." I don't know about "expert" but already I do feel like I know him best, what he likes, needs, dislikes, etc. Most of the time all is great and well, but obviously sometimes I am very tired. My shift begins at 7am and goes until 11pm (unless Dave or a grandma or someone else comes to be with him for a little bit). I leave to go to the restroom or to run down and mix his next feeding and that's about it. Our doctor reminded us the other day to "not leave Paxton for more than a few seconds." Okay!! Boy, am I grateful for nursing, which we have for 8 hours at night right now. If anyone knows of any organizations we can petition or appeal to to have our nursing last longer, please let us know!! I do not know how physically it is even possible for us to stay up all night, be mom and dad the next day, and stay up again the next night and on and on and on. If you can't sleep at night by him, how could you take a nap during the day when he always needs constant watching? Ah!

Paxton is home and doing wonderfully well. I have wondered a few times if he was getting sick, when he is way up on his oxygen or needing a lot of suctioning, being very fussy for long uncalming periods of time, etc. It seriously seems like our prayers ward a lot of things away! And Paxton has definitely been one prayed-for boy!! I'm so humbled that he is home and we are actually able to do this!

The most obvious are:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">1. You have to let people help you.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">2.

Thinking about how to do this day-in, day-out "by myself" scares me a lot. Especially as I think about Dave being gone, family needing to "get on with their lives", my nursing ending, thinking about paying for a helper and our new electrical bill (8 machines running all the time), and trying to care for all three boys' different needs and attention, I was overwhelmed! This verse spoke so boldly to me.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333;">"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer&nbsp;...be thou faithful unto death, and I will give&nbsp;thee a crown&nbsp;of life."

My heart broke when I heard the news Monday morning that she had passed away. Home to that God who could give her rest! I was in tears as the weight of our two very different realities hung over me. I got to take my baby home, and my friends had to send their baby Home. I am so incredibly grateful for the Gospel. For the good news. The amazing news that Christ has atoned and died for us all and lives again and we all will be resurrected and restored to our perfect frame. Not the state we experience here. Not the state sweet Paxton or Jane or many others are in. I'm so grateful for the scriptures which helped to calm my heart and realize He is the maker and creator of all things, the giver and taker of life, and all things are according to HIS will and HIS plan. Her mom said it so beautifully at her funeral, that it is only sad for us, not for Jane. Sad because everyone who loved her will miss her so much, and happy for her to be back in the arms of Jesus. She also said something that just struck my heart. Jane was intubated her whole 4 months of life and, like Paxton, could never make a sound. She said, "How lovely that the first time you ever spoke or sang would be in Heaven." ! &nbsp;And from her Dad, "Your life of four months speaks of a lifetime." Absolutely. Jane has taught us all so much. These precious spirits are indeed gifts from God, bringing us closer to Him, more dependent on Him, and renewing our faith and trust in Him. I'm so grateful Jane's parents believe they will be with her again one day, too. She is a beautiful girl and I know is so grateful for the incredibly strong and loving parents and brother she was given.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333;">"Wherefore, fear&nbsp;not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy&nbsp;is full."

It was a med issue that was giving Paxton fever, pain, and other non-desirable things. Now that we have that figured out, just look at our happy angel! Do you think he knows he's coming home tomorrow? And just look at those balloons in celebration! Oh I so hope we don't jinx it! But we had to share our excitement with all of you. I have never gotten as many smiles as I did tonight, and not just on camera, but at all! Yay for Superman! After <b>121 Days in the NICU</b>, 17 weeks to the day, our SUPER Hero gets to come home!

We have all joked that he would walk right out of there if he could. He has been loving sitting up, looking around, interacting with people, tolerating therapies incredibly well, and overall just been very comfortable and content. Mom and Dad, grandmas, and some special others volunteered and completed the trach, CPR, and g-tube trainings with us. We even roomed in last week (where we care for Paxton in a family room there in the NICU for the most part by ourselves, with most of his home medical equipment there to practice with) and had him do his 'car seat trial'. We have all been running around a little crazy this week preparing for the big day. People helping with errands, heavenly neighbors literally "detailing" my home, making phonecalls, appointments, and finishing forms and notes of all kinds.&nbsp;We have been planning for him to come home today so we could have Dad home for two weeks in a row, a chance for all of us to go through this big transition together. However, this weekend, par for the course of the NICU, plans have changed again.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">I could hardly believe it when Paxton did not have a good day Saturday and officially, yesterday, his homecoming was postponed.&nbsp;He suddenly has a few things going on. He has some painful granulation tissue around his g-tube :( and is having some med problems. Paxton's secretions have also significantly increased (when I say this it means we are suctioning his trach very often and it is very thick, making it much more difficult for him to breathe). Normally when this happens, it is not long before we learn Paxton has developed another form of pneumonia. We were crossing our fingers that it was just from a new type of trach he got on Friday. Unfortunately, yesterday he spiked a fever, giving them enough reasons to do get cultures and do labs, and postpone his 'departure'. I am so sad. So sad for him. So sad for us. For his brothers. Everyone helping. Sad for the process to seem unending. It has been my biggest worry that soon after we get him home he will end up right back in the hospital from getting an infection... I'm beginning to wonder if he will ever go very long without them. I will hope so! He has only been off antibiotics from the last bout for 2 weeks. And he seemed SO healthy and happy! It was Paxton in a light we had never seen before, because he truly felt so good. Now I just ache seeing him all upset and uncomfortable again.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">We do want the little guy to have the best 'healthy start' ever, so it is best to wait. But what a letdown. My home is dustfree, we are all healthy, and we are all so tired of the schedule. I can never complain because we have been so blessed with all of Paxton's improvements, and simply that he is here! I guess we should so expect this, this is just how having a baby in the NICU goes. For a moment it was just so real. SO tangible. And ask anyone that has talked to us, but we really were so much more excited than nervous to have him home. Be here as a complete family together. Get him out of the sterile white walls and gloves. Give him more holding, attention, care, distraction, interaction, and happy family life. I so wanted that for him and for all of us. It will come. It is just another setback. Everything has been completed now so we won't have to pass anything else off. Yes I have had my moments of grieving this weekend, I know it sounds funny, but it was a big deal and for it to seem so certain for 2 weeks... 2 weeks hospital time is a long time to get your hopes up! I shouldn't have been shocked but I was. Again, he is here, and having him healthy is the most we can ask for, so we go with that outcome wherever it means he has to be. Well, NICU, looks like we will be around a little longer. Hopefully just not too much longer! Maybe even still this week! We are ready, whenever it comes.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Thank you all so much for your help. Gosh, we have been so blessed by everyone's service and love. There isn't a day that goes by that we are not served physically and receiving love and support emotionally. We are extremely blessed and so grateful for the Gospel. It has put everything in perspective for us and given us so much hope and faith. My little Pacman is such a fighter and will continue to fight through all that he is given. "Hit Me with Your Best Shot" must be his theme song! I can't apologize for being so proud of him. He is just the sweetest and best.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Here are a few highlights from last week.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">First and foremost, Halloween. Dave and I have always dressed up and this year thought our drs. and nurses would get a kick out of us trying to be them, like we do everyday! And our kids were... nothing other than SUPERHEROES, of course! That's what they are to us so it was all super fitting.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TNhXhQII66I/AAAAAAAAAoM/NGmCK8Tghig/s1600/IMG_7797.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

It is crazy and true! Paxton has improved so much being on antibiotics and having a larger trach that now we are just working on getting his feeds back up and tolerated well with his new G-tube. Of course we don't know how long exactly it will take but we are anticipating and preparing to bring him home within the next two weeks! Ah, Hallelujiah!! As one nurse put it, "I am so happy! We didn't even think he was going to make it, and now just look at him!" It is true. We are all amazed. Grateful. Excited.&nbsp;Thrilled!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">This last week we have been doing our trach training, g-tube training, CPR, etc. etc. Not to mention all the things we have to get, do, and figure out before he comes home. I have been on phonecalls with insurance, home health companies, other families with trached children, etc., and filling out all sorts of applications and forms. There is so much to learn and do for this to all finally fall into place. But each night I just remind myself not to over-complicate things. We are learning how to take care of him and that is all that really matters. God sends these little spirits to us because he knows we can do it with His help. And so we will!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">We have had such an amazing outpouring of love and kindness and prayers since Paxton's story was broadcast. Many strangers have reached out and said how much it touched them, or how they could relate to some part of the story, and helped us to not feel alone as they have struggled with something rare as well. &nbsp;Some have shared that their child is 24, and doing well; others have shared that they lost their dear one after a great battle for life. All of them have said that they wouldn't trade a minute of it. Of course they wished they could take all of the pain away, but they truly treasured every day with their angel. Oh, we feel the same way! It is hard to understand how you could want and love to care so much for someone with so many challenges. All of that is true until you have one of your very own, a sweet and precious angel that has so much love wrapped up in such a tender body. I cannot even express how grateful I am for all that Paxton has taught me already. About love. About myself. About life. We feel so bonded to him, and his smiles, movements, and progress bring us such joy!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton has definitely improved this week, and even more specifically, he had his lowest eye pressures ever in his last eye exam on Thursday! One is even in normal range! Immediately I thought of the power of prayer and know that those many added prayers this week really blessed Paxton's eyes. It's so awesome to see such a great effect!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">By the way, I just have to say...I hoped that Paxton's story would help someone else, bless someone else, that that was why we were supposed to do it. I still hope that is true, but I can honestly say I did not even consider how much it would bless us! I did not know what would be shared, and had no idea they would treat it so tenderly with even a "Praying for Paxton" message as part of it! I am completely floored at how much WE have been the recipients of blessings from that great happening. SOOO many prayers for Paxton, friendships made, and hearts lifted. Thank you to all of you who have been praying for Paxton and sending us your well-wishes and love. It has truly helped our little angel advance! There is no doubt in my mind that his betterments are by chance, or even simply by medicine. I know they are by faith and prayers and God's will being wrought in Paxton's life here. He has truly overcome so much and exceeded by such large amounts what any doctor had ever thought would be possible for Paxton. I am so grateful for their expertise, too, and know that with the prayers and great caregivers combined, many miracles have happened to help Paxton heal and move forward. Like I said, Hallelujia! :)</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Speaking of prayers, I haven't done this yet, but my heart aches tonight for a friend from college who has also had their newborn in the NICU with us since a week after Paxton arrived. I learned today that their sweet daughter is not doing well, and right now the doctors don't know what else they can do for her heart. This week is a big week for them as doctors will meet together on Friday again to discuss any further plan of action. If you have any more room in your heart and you can remember, please pray for baby Jane. I really hope she can be buoyed up by our faith and prayers and see significant changes this week! If it is God's will, I know it can happen. And I pray for them for whatever that is, that they will all be lifted up! We have been so blessed by your prayers, I feel like it is the least I can do to try to spread the love and prayers for them as well.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">So thank you all for hanging in there with us. It is so exciting we are to this point. Paxton is really reacting to us and smiling all the time. A sweet nurse even caught a video on her phone of him LAUGHING! It is so amazing, all that he is doing. So many sweet nurses come tell us how cute he is and one even cried to me on Friday night about the sweet experience she had with him and just the huge amount of love she felt from him! It really touched my heart and I am so glad others are experiencing what we feel as well.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">He is ready to come home. This little almost 4 month old, 7 lb. boy just wants to sit up and look at things all day. He is sick of laying in his bed and staring at the white ceiling. I think he is going to love being home and staring at his brothers going crazy all day. :) OK, he will need baby steps at getting used to it all but it will be a great thing! It is time to move on to the next phase of life! Time to create our new normal!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Love to you all. Thank you for your prayers and physical service and emotional support. We love you to pieces!

We are so proud of him and humbly grateful for his presence in our fortunate lives! Tonight we were able to share his struggles and triumphs with many people. Already our reporter from KSL has put us in contact with a mother who emailed her immediately, with a daughter who has a deletion somewhere on chromosome 7 as well! It may not be the same gene breaks, but I'm so curious and excited to learn from her! Already a great result from tonight's story.

I got to share our lovely happenings of last Monday only to have Paxton on the verge of some downtime again. He was well enough to have his surgeries on Wednesday, as scheduled; however, soon after, Paxton really took a turn for the worse. :) We sort of called in some emergency prayers with the family on Saturday as Paxton had had a major setback.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">In surgery on Wednesday, Paxton had his gastrostomy tube placed, and three hernias repaired (which the doctor said are actually harder to do and more painful to heal). My precious boy came back with 6 total incisions, and as pale as ever (as is typical after surgery). The first night he seemed to be doing fairly well, as he was loaded on a lot of pain and sedation meds. He came back to the NICU on a ventilator as his respiratory drive was decreased and he needed to be able to rest and heal. He was back on his trach mask Thursday morning.</div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLvLVtlKncI/AAAAAAAAAmg/I9jtc5_brI0/s1600/IMG_7199.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

This is a little freaky to see but I just told myself it would get better. If we could only suction less it would have, but he could barely breathe through that little opening in his tracheostomy tube.&nbsp;In the meantime...&nbsp;</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Paxton was struggling a bit and I begged to hold him, hoping it would comfort him. He slept for a while and then I began to feel something wet under him on my leg. When I opened the blanket and saw blood all over I was very nervous! Was his g-tube bleeding out? Fortunately Paxton had only kicked his IV loose from his foot and the blood and IV fluids had been leaking out. What made it even less comforting was having to watch him be poked 7 more times to replace that stinkin' IV. They finally got it in his scalp. Then they had to try again to give him an art-line (an IV in an artery, measuring blood and drawing blood coming directly from the heart). More struggling to get it in the right spot. Paxton had had it and was exhausted after, in a way I hadn't seen him since August 5th: pale, jittery and shaking. He was sort of asleep but not in a peaceful way, in a very overwhelmed and almost shocked way. It was very sad for me to see him going through all of this yet again. Just last week I was sitting him up in my lap and feeling such progress.&nbsp;</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">We kept having to redo blood draws, x-rays, etc. and things just weren't going smoothly. Paxton was desatting even on the vent, with his heartrate dropping to 80.&nbsp;His x-rays were showing deflated lungs.&nbsp;At this point Paxton went back on the ventilator. He was grateful for it and completely let the vent do all the work for him. He needed the rest. All signs were showing Paxton was very sick and he started antibiotics Friday night.</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLvsyW6JheI/AAAAAAAAAnI/4PbZvC4gIFI/s1600/photo+4.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLvsyW6JheI/AAAAAAAAAnI/4PbZvC4gIFI/s400/photo+4.JPG" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Saturday after much commotion, puffy and out.</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Saturday was the worst. When I walked in he was literally purple. He was deserting in his sleep, even on the vent, and was very swollen. Our nurse thought he not only had the pneumonia in his lungs, and the staph infection in his trachea stoma, but also that he looked and acted septic (an infection in the blood). We still hadn't heard back on his labs to confirm that or not. Paxton was still struggling to breathe, with long expiratory breaths. Albuterol did not help. He had his 6th blood transfusion.&nbsp;Our wonderful nurse, Micheala, thought it might be worth it to try the next size trach tube. Thankfully she was right! However, within the next half hour Paxton desatted down to 9, with heartrates down to 49. It was the most scared we had been in a long time, literally watching him go blue and lifeless right before our eyes! I was standing next to him both times and trying to shake his arm during the second one (as we were all stimulating in any way possible), I couldn't believe how blue and immediately stiff Paxton's arm was. I couldn't even bend it. It was awful.&nbsp;Thankfully, we have amazing nurses and respiratory therapists that work together so fast to manually resuscitate and keep Paxton with us.&nbsp;That was the last of those awful events we have seen since Saturday. And I hope we are no where close to that again!</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Paxton is finally recovering. Getting more meds and sleep. His blood pressure has been abnormally high (126) and we are hoping all of this combined is not an indication of pulmonary hypertension, again. Echo today to check. He's even having some calm awake times again. Definitely better.&nbsp;</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">So thanks again for your love and prayers. He looks quite different right now than he did last week when he was filmed for the news. Such is <i>his</i>&nbsp;story! See a glimpse of it on KSL tonight at 10pm, if you wish.&nbsp;</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Love to you all, and to our sweet Paxton!

Yes. Newsworthy? Well, why not? Paxton <i>is</i> News-Worthy! That's why today we had the neat honor of being able to tell his story to a KSL reporter. It will be aired on the 10 o'clock news next Monday, October 18th. Ah! &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">The beautiful Jennifer Stagg had come across our blog when Paxton was about 2 weeks old and wondered if we would be willing to share the experiences we were having, publicly. Things were just so critical then and we were so overwhelmed and emotional with all that was going on that we just couldn't do that, emotionally, mentally, or time-allowing. About 6 weeks later when things had settled down a bit, her message kept coming back to my mind, and I wondered if maybe it was something we were supposed to do for some reason, some person out there. So, we said yes!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Jennifer was so wonderful to work with and made it such a comfortable and relaxed experience. They met with the ingenious head of the NICU (literally, he invented the oscillator that saved Paxton after his tracheotomy!), filmed us with Paxton, and with our boys at home. Of course our boys said the cute tender things <i>off</i> camera and almost immediately after they left, Dave and I started saying to each other, "Duh! How did we forget to say ______, _________, and ______?! That is a such an obvious, critical, or important part of the story!" Agh! So goes it. Some people are made to be on camera and some people are made to be <i>behind</i> it! You all know which one of those I am! There is just so much to the story and so much of it is obvious to us or even behind us a little bit that we failed to think we should explain it. Simple things. But she is talented and I know she will get across what will hopefully make for an uplifting story even with our omissions. And you may just have to indulge me next week and let me share anything else I wish I did!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton is our little miracle baby and here to teach us so much, so I'm so glad his story can be shared. And I feel indulged that someone else would want to share it, too!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQCZRS_1XI/AAAAAAAAAmY/FP9_8ZOmfYA/s1600/IMG_7150e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="160" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQCZRS_1XI/AAAAAAAAAmY/FP9_8ZOmfYA/s320/IMG_7150e.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQCV7s89mI/AAAAAAAAAmU/FNfVcDK6fsw/s1600/IMG_7152e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQCV7s89mI/AAAAAAAAAmU/FNfVcDK6fsw/s320/IMG_7152e.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">So on to our little bundle.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton has been doing fairly well. I have learned my posting pattern. I like to share on the blog when something really positive has happened. ALWAYS, the day of or day after I post, we have always learned some bad news on those days. It's like "Really? I just told everyone everything is going so well!" Fortunately today I am posting anyway!...</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Getting a little bit of morphine again helped Paxton be able to get more rest and tolerate more interaction and positions when he was awake. He has been having bradycardia (heartrate dropping) a lot and we don't really know why it is happening. But he recovers on his own so without having to intervene they are not too worried about it. He is back to having bolus feeds (every three hours for a half hour), instead of continuous feeds, and for the most part he is tolerating it well. We are trying to figure out if he <i>is</i> aspirating the milk into his lungs from reflux because... again, he has some sort of infection. (Mom thinks there may be a correlation here, folks!) Both in his lungs <i>and</i> his stoma this time. :( This time he definitely seems a bit more sick to me as he has been pretty fussy again and <i>really</i> junky (what we call it when he has a lot of secretions constantly to be suctioned). A good thing is I can hold him now really anytime I want (and do for all of my visits!) and am able to comfort him or work with him most of the time. That is SO wonderful! So we have to see exactly what infection it is and what that means because...</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton is scheduled to have his gastrostomy surgery on Wednesday! That is where they put a feeding tube directly into his stomach. Along with that they have always said they would do the nissen surgery for his reflux, and now they are debating it. Hopefully they can decide tomorrow!!! He will also be having his hernia repaired and his circumcision while he is in the OR. Poor guy, big day! I do still hope it will be able to happen so we can get him home sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Today they also mentioned in rounds that they think he has edema. Apparently they can tell that his weight gain and "chubbiness" is not just all cute baby fat and is a lot of water retention. I have heard them say now several times that Paxton is a difficult one when it comes to nutrition. His feeds take about 20 minutes for them to figure out and mix together the proper amounts of everything he is getting: breastmilk, human milk fortifier, neosure formula, beneprotein, and microlipids (straight fat!). They are afraid he is getting too much liquid or not enough protein or salt to help it leave the body properly. Luckily for me pretty soon I will get to do the math and the mixing (no, not luckily. I'm not so hot at math).</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">A sad thing for us today was to hear them talk about their concern for Paxton's head size, that it doesn't seem to be growing proportionately to his body. :( This makes me and Dave sad, obviously. We did know there would be a chance he could have microcephaly and still can. We are hoping for the best. If it's not due to nutrition it could be part of his condition. We are aware there may be many things that will change or become more apparent as he grows older. It won't change a thing about how we feel <i>about</i> him, just how we feel <i>for</i> him. He still looks perfect to us. :)</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQG1E-k6uI/AAAAAAAAAmc/5YKOCoaccX0/s1600/IMG_7134ed.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TLQG1E-k6uI/AAAAAAAAAmc/5YKOCoaccX0/s400/IMG_7134ed.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Paxton's bubbles are from the air coming into his trach and going up the back of his throat. Since his swallowing ability is not as strong and he has no palate, there's no way to really fix that until he is not on humidity and oxygen, which will be a while. So we are wiping them away constantly. Apparently I didn't even notice them on this cute little pic of Paxton reaching. :)</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">There are also many other simple concerns right now...like trying to help him make progress orally, to take any stimulation around his mouth more positively and suck a binky more regularly. His flat head. Rotation of his ankles. Calming him completely <i>without</i> any medicine to help. His expiratory wheezing. Etc. Etc.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Some hours are good, some hours are bad. More good than bad though. Counting our blessings, definitely.

If you are a blogger (which I didn't really become until this whole thing happened and gave me a reason to), you know that you think of how you would like to share things all the time, but then when you actually get the chance to do it, it's like trying to pull it out of the clouds!

Holland</a>. I wish I could post the actual video so you can see this amazing moment I felt 6 minutes and 14 seconds into his talk, but only the audio is available so far. In speaking to the LDS church members and people all over the world, he expressed "the personal value and sacred splendor of every one of you", thanking each of us and telling us "how loved of God you are." He thanked so many people, all of us for all of the specific good things we do. Then he went on to share, with what I felt was tender emotion, these words:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"<i>I am grateful for selfless parents who perhaps for a lifetime, care for a challenged child. Sometimes with more than one challenge. Sometimes with more than one child.</i>"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Wow. Does anything else really need to be said? Did you hear it? I can't think about it without tearing up again. It penetrated my heart. Not because I am selfless, but because I know that God knows us, and loves us. I've always know that. But watching Elder Holland speak, as the camera was straight on him, I felt staring into his teary eyes that he was speaking straight to me! I know I was not the only one hearing it, but it blessed my heart so much. To have an individual thank you from an apostle of the Lord, I knew it was God's way of telling me exactly Himself. And that is simply too incredible to describe. I wanted to share it with you.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;On to my precious boys, all of whom I have been able to spend very balanced and good time with, so thankfully. Paxton has had ups and downs the last two weeks but overall is doing fairly well. Nothing critical at least. And that's no small thing in our book! But he has had some struggles with just the day to day stuff.<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Since my last post:<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-The doctors tried to wean Paxton from the morphine needed from his last surgery, but apparently not &nbsp;slow enough and Paxton had actual withdrawals. :( Measured by much crying, tiny catnaps - not able to sleep more than a half hour at a time, and extreme diarrhea and diaper rash. It was a rather sad week as we felt like he wasn't getting any of his primary nurses and the others didn't quite catch on that this was not acceptable. It took us a few days ourselves to realize how it was all correlated. So just two days ago the doctors agreed and started his morphine again. Night and Day! He has been so calm, sleeping so much better, content when he is awake, staring at me and letting me sit him up, work with him, and do more than one stimulating activity at a time (singing, staring, rocking, OR bouncing, talking, and stroking, etc.). Amazing. It is so wonderful to be able to do more of the things most moms do with most babies! To actually be able to comfort him the way you would another child. I have not taken a moment of it for granted and have loved every second holding him and comforting him. It has made me so happy when I can pick him up and calm him almost instantly. One of the many rewards of being a mother. My Dad asked me today if we were 100% bonded and I assuredly said YES! I think you can sort of tell when we are together. ;-)</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-Paxton has been wheezing a lot and been given albuterol to help his lungs expand, which many times it does and sometimes it does not.</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-Paxton was sick of his NJ tube and pulled it out. When the doctors met at his bedside for cares they joked and dared him to pull his NG out, and he did. Right then. They loved it. They left the NJ out and only put back in the NG to get him ready for stomach feeds again through the G-tube....</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-Last Friday Paxton first made the 3 kilo mark...that magic weight he needed to be to have his G-tube &amp; Nissen surgery. Of course, he fluctuates his weight so much that right now he is still under, but we are hoping by next week he will have stayed there plus some. After that, we will really be on the road to recovery and preparing to come home. WoW!</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-Paxton had two studies done under fluoroscopy (video X-ray...pretty cool). One was a swallow study to determine if he was ready to by chance try any type of oral feeding, but it was way too premature. He wasn't even ready to have the nipple of a bottle in his mouth, let alone a strange fluid coming in. They literally got a few drops in his mouth and it just went up into his hollow palate. :( Suffice it to say, there was no swallowing done then. He also had a GI study to make sure there were not any GI abnormalities they needed to be aware of before doing his G-tube and nissen surgery next week. He did have reflux but I haven't heard the official report yet.</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-Amazingly Paxton did not have to have eye surgery again at his last check-up. I thought for sure it was going to happen but was so happy for him that they were okay. Checking again in two weeks.</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;">-The nurses had to change Paxton's PICC line dressing every day for a week and thought it was just from his sweating so much from his heart condition. Come to find out, 5 days later, there was a hole in it. It was leaking. To my amazement, they tried to repair it! I was thankful there was not the right size kit so they decided to pull it out. (The PICC line has to always be extremely sterile as it is going into the heart and could cause major sickness if anything went wrong with it.) We (me and Paxton in our lifetimes) have had enough infections that I did not want that risk, and am still amazed and grateful he didn't get anything in that time we were unaware. So it came out. Yippee! So much easier to dress and more comfortable for him. And, because it is out, we were able to give Paxton his <i>first real bath</i> in a little baby tub on Monday! Baths will always be very cautious as we can't get any water down the trach, but sitting him up we did it just fine. At first he did not know what to think of it. He forgot what it feels like to be in water. But soon he warmed up to the warm water and I think really liked it being drizzled over his body. Cute little bug loved being wrapped in warm blankets after and rocking in my arms. Way to go, buddy!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4k5LegsdI/AAAAAAAAAmM/JvBq-uD6sks/s1600/IMG_2431.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4k5LegsdI/AAAAAAAAAmM/JvBq-uD6sks/s400/IMG_2431.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4DFxybfhI/AAAAAAAAAlA/XP7guCSWdgA/s1600/IMG_6925.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4DFxybfhI/AAAAAAAAAlA/XP7guCSWdgA/s400/IMG_6925.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4DV0u-mtI/AAAAAAAAAlE/jiS43mCn27k/s1600/IMG_6927.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4DV0u-mtI/AAAAAAAAAlE/jiS43mCn27k/s400/IMG_6927.jpg" width="266" /></a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;">A huge happy thing was that we were told we could start all of the trach training, pretty much our six-week-out marker. It was a happy thing to put it on the calendar! And scary. All this weekend I got very anxious about it. I don't know why. That seems to be all I've wanted, for Paxton to come home, but watching the trach video and seeing these babies fight the care for their trachs, and other things, made me very nervous to start this next phase. Alone. Alone in the sense of no nurses to run to, to ask for help, to relieve me to go to bed at night, etc. As I said on my DDAY post, a life-changer of all sorts. But not a life-stopper. We can do this! On the morning I almost couldn't eat and Dave asked me what was wrong, I came up to have a little study. It's amazing how through one prayer and a little effort, immediate comfort and answers came to me about my fears. What a merciful Father who is SO present if we invite Him to be. I was reminded that He will guide us into knowing all things that we should do, that He won't leave us comfortless or alone, and that all flesh is in HIS hands, as Paxton has been from the beginning, and will continue to be.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton is 12 weeks old (7 weeks corrected age). The last two days I have been able to do some new things with him contentedly: a form of tummy time, grasping a rattle and lifting it, trying him in new positions, etc. He stares at us for so long, tracks us as we move around the room, and handles more stimulation all at once. Some great improvements!<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4FbEvjZWI/AAAAAAAAAlc/Ocvt9mq6GF8/s1600/IMG_6877.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4FbEvjZWI/AAAAAAAAAlc/Ocvt9mq6GF8/s640/IMG_6877.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4Ft1N-ZMI/AAAAAAAAAlg/UQs_Wn3qeis/s1600/IMG_6911.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4Ft1N-ZMI/AAAAAAAAAlg/UQs_Wn3qeis/s640/IMG_6911.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4Dkaan7iI/AAAAAAAAAlI/rgYne9FXcVQ/s1600/IMG_6871.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4Dkaan7iI/AAAAAAAAAlI/rgYne9FXcVQ/s400/IMG_6871.jpg" width="266" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4kx5yYytI/AAAAAAAAAmI/t__Nw5oFunI/s1600/photo+3-1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4kx5yYytI/AAAAAAAAAmI/t__Nw5oFunI/s400/photo+3-1.JPG" width="298" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4kx5yYytI/AAAAAAAAAmI/t__Nw5oFunI/s1600/photo+3-1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; color: black;"></span></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4ktwT_pMI/AAAAAAAAAmE/cmUi3jDdA68/s1600/photo+4-1e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4ktwT_pMI/AAAAAAAAAmE/cmUi3jDdA68/s400/photo+4-1e.jpg" width="298" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4FwgYcNyI/AAAAAAAAAlk/CGZbG26laH8/s1600/IMG_3282.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4FwgYcNyI/AAAAAAAAAlk/CGZbG26laH8/s400/IMG_3282.JPG" width="400" /></a></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4lKHRDFzI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/8CXrLRILVgs/s1600/IMG_7112.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4lKHRDFzI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/8CXrLRILVgs/s400/IMG_7112.jpg" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">his little "weights" rattle</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4GWE2MQiI/AAAAAAAAAl0/uda9RPXa0XM/s1600/IMG_3194.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TK4GWE2MQiI/AAAAAAAAAl0/uda9RPXa0XM/s400/IMG_3194.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I never say enough about our sweet Daddy, Dave. I don't say much about him because I can't speak for him and how he is feeling, but I can say how we feel about him! He is a champ Dad through this all right now. (Hmmm I wonder where Paxton gets his Champ-iness from. :) He is totally trying to balance time with us at home, Paxton at the hospital (every day he is in town as well), work, school, travel, church assignment, and homework. I really don't know how he is doing it and I pray he will continue to be sustained. If you all pray for him perhaps pray for him not to fall asleep at the wheel as he is running on such little sleep with the latest nights and early mornings. I love him dearly and so does his Paxton. He knows his Dad as well and is comforted by him. Some of these pics just in the last two weeks sort of sum up their connection.

This last week Paxton has improved SO MUCH that we are able to start talking about him coming home! Yes, I said... COMING HOME.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you believe it?&nbsp;I never quite knew if that would ever happen, but now hopefully it is a reality and in a few months our cutest little bug will be here at home with us! He still has quite a bit of growing to do, his G-tube and nissen surgery, as well as more eye check-ups and possible surgeries. But he is doing great and we are so happy with his progress.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Paxton has made many developments in the last 2 weeks that I am so excited to share:</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">***The biggest milestone of all: &nbsp;Paxton came off the ventilator! Yep, that's right. He had two "mask trials" the two days before and was doing so well breathing on his own, he would fight it when they put him back on the ventilator! He liked doing the work by himself! So on Sept. 19th he had been on only oxygen and humidity flow from his trach mask for over 24 hours and they WHEELED that ventilator away! That was exciting. And scary! (no back-up breaths or pressure support anymore!) But Paxton's heart and lungs have been doing great. As our doc explained to us, Paxton will have this new attachment of oxygen and humidity as long as he has a trach. :( That was kind of a bummer but we will take it. He has been so much easier to maneuver and he is so happy not having all those hard and non-movable pieces right up by his face. The mask and tube are much more movable. Now I can pick him up or sit him up in his bed or on my lap and let my little guy see the world. And we both love it! It has been great!***</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Speaking of how much he didn't like that ventilator tubing, we had a crazy experience last Thursday. Paxton was coming back from his eye exam in the OR when all of a sudden all of his stats kept dropping, heartrate, oxygen, etc. The RT looked down and realized Paxton had pulled his trach out! They quickly got it back in and all of his numbers came right back up, thankfully. That is how much Paxton was hating that tubing, he would pull at it every time he was awake. This current tubing is much more soft and movable; I don't think it bothers him half as much. It made me a little nervous as Mom though and gave me this feeling that I will have to fight for Paxton to have a monitor sent home with him. It won't be enough to have him in the same room, my eyes will have to be on him at all times! How else would I know if that little trach came out and he wasn't breathing anymore? Ah, scary to think about. Not quite there yet. But on a more positive note, what a strong little dude! I'm so glad he's feeling good enough to be a little feisty and show us all who's the boss!</div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_J7la5mBI/AAAAAAAAAkc/FXTb6mg6Z6M/s1600/IMG_3033.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_J7la5mBI/AAAAAAAAAkc/FXTb6mg6Z6M/s400/IMG_3033.jpg" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Trach with ventilator tubing</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_J-WHpyMI/AAAAAAAAAkg/u1nGIf4-xwY/s1600/IMG_3102.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_J-WHpyMI/AAAAAAAAAkg/u1nGIf4-xwY/s400/IMG_3102.jpg" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Trach with new mask and tubing</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_KAjbKSOI/AAAAAAAAAkk/EE9v3K3FSok/s1600/IMG_3112.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_KAjbKSOI/AAAAAAAAAkk/EE9v3K3FSok/s400/IMG_3112.jpg" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No we have not changed teams, a loving uncle gave these socks to Paxton to "remember his time in the Foothills", so I took a picture for him, and it just turned out too cute not to share!

He is still getting all the nutrients and calories he needs yet never has a full feeling. Sad for him! He has been at 5 lbs. 6 ounces for quite some time so the nutritionist has really been trying to figure out what they can add to his milk to help him grow more regularly and stable. We are waiting for that magic last pound that will allow him to have his gastronomic surgeries and move on!</div><div style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">Pax is on all oral meds now, getting nothing through IVs, although he still has his PICC line into his heart for his upcoming surgeries. He has been slowly weaning down on his pain meeds, showing he is progressing and feeling less pain...ah, grateful!</div><div style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">Dave and I finally got to hold him again just a few days ago; it had been about 2.5 weeks! His big incision and broken rib made it so we could not hold him for quite a while, and before that was the pneumonia (of which he seems to be fully cleared of again)! So we have loved every minute of that and it seems Paxton always does, too. He definitely knows mom and dad and grandparents' faces, too, and will stare at us longer, and over all is having more calm and awake periods. It is so reassuring and great to see him not grimacing so much every time he is awake.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">His chest tube scar has cleared up very well, and his bandages from his incision are off, with only some body glue, tape, and stitches left. But overall he is healing well. His scar is much bigger than we thought! Just another war wound for him to brag about to his big brothers some day.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">Speaking of brothers, last Friday our nurse gave us some tickets to the Fair, which we took our boys to and they loved. We left late and wanted to go see Paxton again while we were in SL and we expected the boys to fall asleep in the car and just take turns going in to see him. Mackay was out before we started the car and Camden was so tired but he heard us talking about Paxton and kept saying, "I want to go see Paxton." The kid really meant it! Camden was so tired but I asked him, "Do you want to come in or stay here and sleep with Daddy?" He replied, "I want to go with you to see Paxton." It was so cute. I said, "OKAY!" and at 11 pm at night,&nbsp;<i>after&nbsp;</i>an active day, I walked into the hospital holding Camden Spiderman's hand to go up to see his brother. Besides all the "Why do you have your child up so late" stares, I was beaming inside that this little guy had so much love for his baby brother he couldn't stand not to see him when he had the chance. And he had always wanted to show him his costume, so this was the perfect opportunity. We did the whole drill of scrubbing in, Camden had a few soft and tired words with Paxton, and then he passed out on the chair. It was tender though. Love all these meant-to-be-brothers boys.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TKC86IWTFeI/AAAAAAAAAk4/w4jbvL2_57k/s1600/IMG_2405.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TKC86IWTFeI/AAAAAAAAAk4/w4jbvL2_57k/s400/IMG_2405.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="400" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TKC88SpviyI/AAAAAAAAAk8/YcP8oyqr0Ck/s1600/IMG_2406.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TKC88SpviyI/AAAAAAAAAk8/YcP8oyqr0Ck/s400/IMG_2406.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_KCxWQvqI/AAAAAAAAAko/d25se61KRqY/s1600/IMG_3147.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TJ_KCxWQvqI/AAAAAAAAAko/d25se61KRqY/s400/IMG_3147.jpg" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Look at that little face!

I loved the Relief Society conference last night and felt like everything they said we should be doing are all the things everyone has been doing for us! I am itching to be doing more for others right now myself! I seriously daydream everyday of the things I can do to thank people that have been offering so much service to our family. So many ideas have come to my mind and I hope in the meantime people know how OH SO VERY GRATEFUL we are! I really can't believe all that has been done and continues to be offered for our family. It has helped lighten our load so very much. So thank you all. Those words sound so hollow and ordinary for the true impact we feel behind them. I hope it's never felt to be taken for granted or under-appreciated. If I have ever seemed that way it was only because I was too tired to convey how much it really means, and if I have ever done that to any of you, please forgive me! I'm so grateful for every single one of you, and every single act of service. Every ride, meal, babysitting, cleaning, yard work, cookie, note, email, the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately it is way too public of a thank you until I am able to make the more personal efforts I would like! But it is all of YOU who are amazing!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">I'm so in awe of all the people that I hear are reading this little blog right now. I'm just amazed at the interest people have in our lives and to know more about our sweet little Paxton. It makes me hope so much that I can do justice to this little hero of mine in sharing his story and triumphs. Some days I'm just so tired and it's harder to get myself in the car to do the drive and routine to get into the NICU, but always the second I get there with Paxton a whole light and joy seriously just fills my being and I am so happy to meet with his sweet little spirit and tender body, to touch his hands and head and whisper I am there, and hold him all the day long if they would let me! (Which no of course they never will! 2 hours is the most we ever get...and that is a great gift!) But I love to take care of him. To do his cares and clean his trach. To sponge bath him and work on his movements. To massage him and do therapy for his senses. To sing to him and pray with him and read to him. Mostly to be taught by him. He teaches me so much. I would never have it any other way. I know it will be work. But he is here for so many reasons and I am so happy he wants to be. So happy his Father is letting him be. It is worth every effort. I can't wait for you all to meet him. He is my hero. The biggest champ in this little tattered but strong and fighting body. What a giant! We love you with all our hearts, Paxton boy!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">The last final improvement to share this week is that Paxton moved back into a big boy crib again yesterday! Hopefully for a lot more than two days. :) Hip hip hooray for improvements! Today is a good day. Thank you all for your prayers and efforts and love. We love you all so much, too!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">One of the best moments/videos yet!:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><br /><iframe allowFullScreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' mozallowfullscreen='true' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dz-4BeL6O-tboZZ3EVh6z1buja93mggnEuJ0rGv2Vf6sMnh6H2eqkDXFC9DZi-Rv-2CozG6-emw56c-U0bI1w' class='b-hbp-video b-uploaded' FRAMEBORDER='0' /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:169:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/1796858005231144848/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=1796858005231144848";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/1796858005231144848";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/1796858005231144848";s:4:"link";s:59:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2010/09/light.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:23;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-613014232206990748";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-09-12T16:07:00.000-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2010-09-12T16:07:05.657-06:00";s:5:"title";s:16:"Answered Prayers";s:12:"atom_content";s:11081:"<div style="text-align: center;">Thank you all so much for your prayers.

Paxton was stitched up with a chest tube left in tact to drain the excess fluid, air, and blood completely before sealing things up. &nbsp;He was sent back up to the NICU and we had to wait a bit to see him while they got everything back in place in his bedspace.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GTt0cm_I/AAAAAAAAAjc/XlACtDUBNkg/s1600/IMG_2034.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GTt0cm_I/AAAAAAAAAjc/XlACtDUBNkg/s320/IMG_2034.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the clamp they used on his PDA...tiny.<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GV7zi5aI/AAAAAAAAAjk/9JlfQqcPjkE/s1600/IMG_2035.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GV7zi5aI/AAAAAAAAAjk/9JlfQqcPjkE/s320/IMG_2035.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">first glance post-op, with his new bandages and chest tube on <i>his</i> left.<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;">He really looked just fine, but it's always scary to see him after the OR as he has been given a paralytic to remain motionless and the vent is doing 100% of the breathing for him. &nbsp;I got a little more nervous as the night went on, expecting things to turn downhill as he would wake up and realize he was in pain, but even then he seemed to remain okay. He would jolt and cry and then calm right down to my voice and touch, something that made me feel so good as his mother, so happy to be right there with him and so wanting to take any and ALL of the pain away!</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GXy9d_wI/AAAAAAAAAjs/-_0q3lmetNw/s1600/IMG_2055.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GXy9d_wI/AAAAAAAAAjs/-_0q3lmetNw/s320/IMG_2055.jpg" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GYiFgq8I/AAAAAAAAAj0/pEONUkpmDEU/s1600/IMG_2040.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GYiFgq8I/AAAAAAAAAj0/pEONUkpmDEU/s320/IMG_2040.JPG" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">It took them quite a few blood pokes to get his CO2 to the right place. The biggest concern was his very high blood pressure. After waiting a while to see if it would come down on its own, they gave him a med to control it, which it did steadily. Then they wanted to give him an art line so they could continually measure the pressure of the blood coming out of the heart, but after an hour and a half of poking him and trying to get the IV into an artery, they decided it wasn't going to work. It made us very sad watching him in this process, screaming when they put it in, then turning his face to my hand (which he was squeezing) and trying to endure the pain in the most dignified way he could while they tried to thread it in the right place. I am blown away in these moments by his majesty and ability to brace himself and endure these moments that are so not pleasant to his little body. He is one big amazing spirit in this little fighting body.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GbByaGcI/AAAAAAAAAj8/aZ8yU5Jba78/s1600/IMG_2042.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GbByaGcI/AAAAAAAAAj8/aZ8yU5Jba78/s320/IMG_2042.JPG" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GdG2UMiI/AAAAAAAAAkE/gsEdWohJ_pk/s1600/IMG_2057.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1GdG2UMiI/AAAAAAAAAkE/gsEdWohJ_pk/s320/IMG_2057.JPG" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1Gep1_ZxI/AAAAAAAAAkM/L0fI4fYRG9g/s1600/IMG_2059.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1Gep1_ZxI/AAAAAAAAAkM/L0fI4fYRG9g/s320/IMG_2059.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Paxton was not able to get really any good sleep. He would drift off until a jolt or deep breath would hurt his lung or body and then he would cry for a moment before being calmed back down. On and off all day. When one of our primary nurses came back on Saturday night she agreed with my feelings and gave him some more medicine to help him sleep. Yeah! He needed it. Since then Paxton has just done better and better. His vent settings have been able to come down, with everything almost to where it was before surgery. We haven't noticed any notable improvements FROM the surgery but hopefully that will come in the days and weeks ahead. Right now his kidneys are trying to deal with the extra blood flow they are now trying to filter to the rest of his body. They will do another echo on his heart soon and see if any further changes need to be made.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">So thank you, thank you for your prayers and help this weekend. It was big and I was exhausted. It takes so much out of you to see them in these situations. I began to get a little glimpse of what it must have been like for the Father, and how at several of the most painful and critical moments of Jesus' life, He had to withdraw His Spirit. I always sort of thought that was because the Father thought it was something the Savior had to do himself, but through these experiences I am beginning to wonder if it was more because it was all the Father could do to not stop the suffering of His son, Himself. It was too much for even Him to bear, and He couldn't ruin the plan by stopping it. I can't even imagine. I just know there are moments I have been at such a contradiction of wanting to be there to help my son bear this burden and pain he is going through, if there is anything I can do I don't want to be even an arms' length away; and yet it is so painful to watch, I either want to push everyone away and stop everything they are doing to my son, or go collapse in the chair because I just can't watch it any longer. It's too painful. I know it probably sounds so melodramatic to each of you, but to me it is so real and so difficult in there with him. I want to be with him every second, and yet it becomes almost too much for me myself. I hate my human nature for that reason and wish I never had to sleep, that I didn't live 50 minutes from his bed, that I didn't have to get home to schedules or any other commitments or timelines. I TRULY wish with all my heart that I could be by his side 100% of the time. And yet I know I am a mom to two other boys, too, and it would be good if they could have some good time with their one and only mom as well, with energy to hold them and play with them and love them without being so drained or tired that I can't put up with the noise or whining. Oh, to be a mom! And that's why I say thanks to you all for your prayers and help this weekend. I was at my max. And because of others' love and willingness to shoulder the burden and be so flexible and willing, I was able to crash last night in a desperate way! Thank you, thank you for all of your support. We are being truly blessed and helped so much in this time. I know things will get better and happy days are ahead again. So thank you from all of us to all of you. Thank you for helping our little Paxton to heal and us to be with our Paxton. &nbsp;We love you all!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1Gg1M_fzI/AAAAAAAAAkU/E_UsUhXyBG0/s1600/IMG_3003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWjMndpYdK4/TI1Gg1M_fzI/AAAAAAAAAkU/E_UsUhXyBG0/s320/IMG_3003.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">our Paxton last night, improving with every day.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:167:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/feeds/613014232206990748/comments/defaulthttp://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6138792939953217993&postID=613014232206990748";s:9:"link_edit";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/613014232206990748";s:9:"link_self";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6138792939953217993/posts/default/613014232206990748";s:4:"link";s:70:"http://daveandshannonnorton.blogspot.com/2010/09/answered-prayers.html";s:11:"author_name";s:7:"Shannon";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/15375574972043144150";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";}i:24;a:12:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6138792939953217993.post-5192769253125517019";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-09-10T10:06:00.000-06:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2010-09-10T10:06:29.451-06:00";s:5:"title";s:7:"It's On";s:12:"atom_content";s:522:"At least that's what we are being told right now.

Hopefully all will go well today. I am more worried about his recovery and aftermath than the actual procedure! Thank you all for your special and added prayers today.
