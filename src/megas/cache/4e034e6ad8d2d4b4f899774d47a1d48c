<h3><strong>THE DAY BEFORE THE GAME</strong></h3>
<p>The evening meal before a game is the most crucial of all. Big match nerves can make the prospect of consuming anything at all on the day nauseating ? but provided you eat well the night before and exert very little energy pre-game, turning up primed to perform is still possible. ?You want more carbs than usual, but not a bucketload,? advises Lovell.</p>
<p>Some fish or chicken along with sweet potato or a jacket potato, alongside some green veg, is a good bet. Have nothing heavy (steak is out). Go Popeye and add spinach, which is packed with vitamins and carotenoid antioxidants. Buy it from a supermarket and, according to a study in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,</em> the exposure to fluorescent light will have significantly boosted its vitamin C content ? vital for aiding iron absorption and thus oxygen transport to your muscles.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3><strong>FOUR HOURS TO GO</strong></h3>
<p>You may be en-route to the game at this stage, so it?s important to have something portable. A personal favourite of Lovell?s is quinoa with chicken and some roasted veg. Prep it the night before and pop it in a container. The last thing you want is to be stuck at a service station morosely eyeing the pasties. A jacket potato with some tuna or salmon is another good option. ?Trial different meals and find out what works best for you,? advises Allinson. Just make sure you focus on starchy carbs and keep fat intake to a minimum.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93" src="http://www.cobbsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-12.19.39-PM.png" alt="" width="593" height="288" srcset="http://www.cobbsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-12.19.39-PM.png 593w, http://www.cobbsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-12.19.39-PM-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></p>
<h4><strong>90 MINUTES TO GO</strong></h4>
<p>Your final nutritional hit should be delivered 75-90 minutes before kick off. ?Tropical fruits ? mangos, papaya, pineapples, bananas ? are all good at this stage because they?ve got modest amounts of fibre and don?t give as much of a sugar rush as other fruits,? says Allinson. Too much of the sweet stuff can lead to lethargy due to blood sugar fluctuations, so avoid sports drinks until immediately before the game, too.</p>
<p>If nerves get the better of you, a liquid meal may be best. Lovell recommends blending 25g of oats with 500ml of skimmed goats milk, one or two scoops of protein powder, half a banana, a few nuts and a teaspoon of hot water.&#8230;</p>

Jump in. <strong>The best places in the islands are in the water.</strong></p>
<p>All the waters around the British Virgin Islands, or BVI, are beautiful, but there are five particular spots that are very popular and for good reason. They?re all on different islands, so you?ll need to charter a yacht to the BVI to reach them or you?ll have to join an organized group. Many dive and snorkel operators visit these sites regularly, so you won?t have any trouble booking your own trip if you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>The Caves at Norman Island</strong></p>
<p>On the west side of Norman Island are three large openings in the rock face that lead you into the famous caves. They reach back far enough to be quite dark once you are fully inside. Snorkelers are fascinated with the many colours of coral growth on the cave walls. In the darkness, the coral polyps come out to feed during daylight, offering snorkelers a view normally seen only by divers on night dives. The nearshore waters are well populated by brilliant tropical fish and other sea life. The shallow water speckled with sunlight is perfect for underwater photography.</p>
<p><strong>The Indians at Pelican Island</strong></p>
<p>Offshore of Pelican Island are four wave-washed pinnacles of rock called the Indians. There is beautiful snorkelling all around the rocks. There are so many fish, It?s like being inside an aquarium. Be careful not to get too close if there is any surge so as not to get pushed into the rocks. Scuba diving is also popular as divers can enjoy some fun swim-throughs and a cave filled with glassy sweepers, small fish with big eyes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Diving the Wreck of the Rhone</strong></p>
<p>The most acclaimed dive site in the BVI is the wreck of the RMS Rhone, which sank during a hurricane in 1867. The wreck is located just offshore of Salt Island. The ship measured 310 feet and split in half when it went down. The bow section is still mostly in one piece, sitting in about 80 feet of water, with a large open space to swim through. The stern section was spread out because, when the ship split up, cold sea water inundated the heated boilers and they exploded.</p>
<p>The remains of the stern are in shallower water. There is a brass porthole lying in the stern area, easily recognizable because it is considered lucky by divers, and thus it remains shiny from divers rubbing the surface of it. The Rhone gained great publicity when it was featured in the 1977 film The Deep. This is not a tough place to dive, but the bay where the wreck lies can be rough in higher winds, so seasickness can happen, especially if you do a surface interval on the boat between dives.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The Baths on Virgin Gorda</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the most recognizable sites in the BVI</strong> is the enormous granite boulders at the ?Baths? on Virgin Gorda. These huge rocks sit in this one spot, as if they appeared out of nowhere, possibly the result of volcanic activity. Water gathers under the boulders in shallow pools, cool and shaded by the rocks. There are paths you can follow between the stones and some of them have shapes that people have named for what they imagine they see there.</p>
<p><strong>St. Thomas US Virgin Islands</strong></p>
<p>The paths require a bit of scrambling and your legs will most definitely get wet, so sport sandals or water shoes are a much better choice than closed shoes. The rocks can be slippery for bare feet. If you go on a clear calm day, you will find the bay full of boats moored or anchored. There is also access from the land side, about ten minutes? walk from the road. Go for a snorkel in the bay after you have explored the formations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Jost Van Dyke, a Lifestyle on the Beach</strong></p>
<p>Northwest of the main island of Tortola are the relaxed atmosphere and sandy beaches of Jost Van Dyke. This little island has only had electricity for about 15 years. The restaurants and bars in Grand Harbor are right on the beach. Hop off your boat and swim in for a cold drink or some tasty island treats. The bay is calm and sheltered, just right for a peaceful swim. You can also go around to White Bay, known for its pristine beach and picturesque setting.</p>
<p><strong>A Little Corner of Paradise in the BVI</strong></p>
<p>All these locations are perfect for enjoying the Caribbean as people dream it will be: warm ocean water, white sand, and sunshine, and a relaxed feeling that lets you leave your worries behind.&#8230;</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>For most people, this is going to be the <strong>most influential factor in their choice of company for tours and travels</strong>. While price is indeed important, keep in mind that being cheap is not always best, especially if it is tantamount into compensating quality. More often than not, it will be better to pay more if it means that you are going to have a better and hassle-free holiday. There are many companies that may charge you more than the actual cost. Look for at least three companies and have them compared on the basis of their price.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Given the fact that there will be multiplicity of choices for companies providing <strong>tours and travels </strong>services, you can differentiate one from the other through looking at the feedbacks from their clients in the past. Through their experiences, it will be easy for you to know the pros and cons of each company. Pay attention to what they are saying about the customer service and overall experience.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>More than just having positive feedbacs from its past clients, reputation can be influenced by other factors as well. For instance, in choosing <strong>travels and Tours Company</strong>, you should also take a look at their affiliations with professional organizations. They should be a part of a network of travel agents and should be regulated by relevant authorities. They should have the licenses to operate, making sure that you will not end up being scammed. It will also be good if they have achieved recognitions in the past, which can be a testament to the quality of service that they can provide.</p>
<h2>Market</h2>
<p>You should also know the target market of the company. <strong>Tours and travels </strong>from different companies are targeted towards different groups. There are some that specialize on vacation tour packages while there are also some that create customized itineraries for pilgrimage tours. You can also <strong>choose a company specializing in adventure tours</strong> or one that caters to the needs of solo travelers.&#8230;</p>

<h2>1. Read Reviews</h2>
<p>Go online and peruse reviews left by other guests. Do take into consideration that those leaving messages aren?t held accountable for what they write, but reviews can allow for insight if bed bugs tend to be a recurring issue with the establishment in question.</p>
<h2>2. Call Ahead</h2>
<p>Prior to booking, call ahead and ask directly whether they take any preventive measures in regards to bed bugs. Establishments that take a proactive approach to the issue are less likely to face an invasion and are often quicker to respond to problems that do arise.</p>
<h2>3. Protect Your Suitcase</h2>
<p>Even if you don?t see telltale signs of bed bugs, this doesn?t mean there isn?t a possibility they are present. The last thing you want to do is be too confident and end up taking an infestation home with you. Keep your suitcase wrapped in plastic to provide additional protection. This will not only assist in keeping your items protected while in hotel rooms, but also when in transit on public transportation where bed bugs can also be traveling.</p>
<h2>4. Skip to the Loo</h2>
<p>There are usually fewer bed bugs located in the bathroom of an infested room than in the main living space. Therefore, it is best to leave your bags in the bathroom until you have been able to confirm the room is sans bugs.</p>
<h2>5. Inspect the Bed</h2>
<p>Pull back all sheets and blankets from the mattress and take a close look at space beneath as well as behind the bed. Closely examine the corners as well as the seams of the bed for the tiny bug. However, the sleeping area is not the only place to check out. Include an inspection of cushions and soft seating in the room or closet, as well.</p>
<h2>6. Raised Luggage</h2>
<p>Once you have brought your luggage into the room, keep it raised to ensure no bugs find their way into it. While you may not have seen any signs in your room upon arrival, this doesn?t mean the small bugs can?t enter your room from next door while you are checked in. Utilize a luggage rack, if available, or place bags on a dresser or desk. Avoid setting them on the bed or other furniture, and be sure to keep clothes picked up, as well.</p>
<h2>7. Bite Marks</h2>
<p>If you begin itching, inspect your skin for bite marks that occur in threes and in a line. If you see this, immediately request a different room multiple floors away. The bugs can easily move to rooms above and below due to their small size, so it is best to move a significant distance.</p>
<p>While bed bugs are a possibility, this doesn?t mean your hotel is bound to have them. <strong>Take proper care to ensure the absence of bugs early on, then relax and get a good night?s sleep.</strong>&#8230;</p>

Known as <strong>one of the most romantic destinations in Italy</strong>, this city will enchant you with the shimmering water of the canals and the centuries-old marble palaces along their side. Arriving in Venice is easy, but getting to your accommodation is another story. The first thing you need to know is that Venice has two parts: a mainland Venice and an island Venice (the historic part). Piazzale Roma is the last mainland point where parking space for buses and cars can be found. From this point, only water transport is possible.

<h1>Arriving by train</h1>
<p>There are <strong>two train stations in Venice: Mestre  and Santa Lucia</strong>. Unless you?re staying in a hotel on the mainland part of Venice, you need to take off at the Santa Lucia train station. From Piazzale Roma, you can take the Vaporetto line number 1 which makes stops along the Grand Canal or the Vaporetto number 2 to get to San Marco. You can arrange a private Venice water taxi in advance which will take you directly to your hotel. You can search for an affordable Venice airport taxi service online and book it before your arrival. The price is fixed with luggage included.</p>
<p>Both Mestre and Santa Lucia stations have a good connection with the Venice airport, Marco Polo. The local bus line 15 will take you from Mestre station to the airport, while the bus line 5 operates between Santa Lucia station and Marco Polo airport. If you prefer door-to-door service, then you can book online a Venice airport taxi service.</p>
<h1>Arriving by plane</h1>
<p><strong>The Marco Polo airport is the main hub for international flights in northeast Italy</strong>. It is well connected to the nearby cities in Veneto region, as well as, the famous ski resorts on the Dolomites.</p>
<p>There are two routes you can choose from for your Venice airport transfer to the historic Venice. There is a direct water route from the dock near the airport. The Alilaguna water bus makes multiple stops in the historic centre, as well as, the Venetian islands.

<p>Another option is to combine land and water route. You can reach Piazzale Roma using public transport or Venice airport taxi.

No matter how well you prepare yourself with maps, you will definitely get lost at least once. But that?s the beauty of exploring Venice on foot: getting lost and finding hidden gems on the way.</p>
<p>To get around the city you can use the public transport ? Vaporetto or Venice water taxi.
