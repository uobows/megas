Her show has featured a wide range of international talent, including artists like Locked Groove, Pär Grindvik, Francois X, Markus Suckut, DJ Sodeyama and many more.In 2016 she expanded her vision into a record label, and has already achieved a list of established remixers of her own production including Tobias., LA-4A, Ian Pooley, Andre Kronert, Markus Suckut and Matrixxman. The Neverwhere project focuses on attention to detail and preserving the art of releasing music; telling a story of origins, culture and collaboration through audio and visual mediums. Each release is a full-sleeve vinyl/digital package with modern surrealist artwork designed by Alland Byallo, additional multi-media elements, and is dedicated to the quality of the production of each record.
