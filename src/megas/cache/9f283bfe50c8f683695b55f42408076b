Hearing is also used for echolocation, which all dolphins have. Dolphin teeth are believed to function as antennae to receive incoming sound and to pinpoint the exact location of an object.[32] Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object&#8217;s shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood.[33] The Indus Dolphin is effectively blind. This may be because not much light penetrates the waters of the Indus river (due to suspended sediments), making the need for vision unnecessary. The dolphin&#8217;s sense of touch is also well-developed, with free nerve endings densely packed in the skin, especially around the snout, pectoral fins and genital area. However, dolphins lack an olfactory nerve and lobes, and thus are believed to have no sense of smell.[35] They do have a sense of taste and show preferences for certain kinds of fish. Since dolphins spend most of their time below the surface, tasting the water could function like smelling, in that substances in the water can signal the presence of objects that are not in the dolphin?s mouth. A group of dolphins is called a &#8220;school&#8221; or a &#8220;pod&#8221;. Male dolphins are called &#8220;bulls&#8221;, females &#8220;cows&#8221; and young dolphins are called &#8220;calves&#8221;.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1436882438;}}s:7:"channel";a:6:{s:4:"link";s:23:"http://sloanlongway.org";s:11:"description";s:68:"Regional History, Historic Automobiles, Astronomy & Hands on Science";s:13:"lastbuilddate";s:31:"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 05:28:15 +0000";s:8:"language";s:5:"en-US";s:9:"generator";s:31:"https://wordpress.org/?v=4.5.13";s:7:"tagline";s:68:"Regional History, Historic Automobiles, Astronomy & Hands on Science";}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:4:{s:3:"url";s:79:"http://sloanlongway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-sl_applogo-32x32.jpg";s:4:"link";s:23:"http://sloanlongway.org";s:5:"width";s:2:"32";s:6:"height";s:2:"32";}s:9:"feed_type";s:3:"RSS";s:12:"feed_version";s:3:"2.0";s:8:"encoding";s:10:"ISO-8859-1";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:15:"source_encoding";s:5:"UTF-8";s:13:"last_modified";s:31:"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 05:28:15 GMT
