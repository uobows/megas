So call me way late to the party. :-)

First, RIP Walter Becker, he was the best! I definitely wish we heard his voice with the Dan sometime before Slang of Ages. I get that he&#039;s not &quot;technically great&quot;, but I actually rather like his sound quite a bit! Almost &quot;southern rock minus the southern&quot;. It would&#039;ve been nice to hear it more.

Second, I always interpreted the creative relationship between Becker and Fagen as Fagen being the bigger half of the music, and Becker being the bigger half of the lyrics, but that it was all mostly collaborative, and relatively close to center throughout, rather than an &quot;I do my thing, you do yours&quot; situation. Circus Money, for as reggae heavy as it is, sounds much more like a Dan album than this one does. I suspect that it wasn&#039;t that Walter was unable to capture the Dan sound here (which we only hear very small whispers of, in my opinion), but rather that he was probably making a deliberate creative decision not to, but to attempt to do something markedly different. 

I both deeply admire that decision and also somewhat disagree with it because it kinda feeds into the idea that Walter was more along for the ride of the Donald-driven Dan show, when as I said, and as I think Circus Money shows, Walter was much more musically involved with the Dan sound than this album here implies.

3) I love this album! And I agree with 90+% of what you say about it. Here are my disagreements:

a) Hat Too Flat is actually one of my favorite tracks on this album, probably second only to Surf and/or Die. I&#039;m actually listening to it on a repeat-one loop as I&#039;m writing this. It&#039;s weird, dark, goofy, and fun. C&#039;mon, &quot;my English is more better&quot;? That&#039;s good stuff! And the repeat of it towards the 3/4, 5/6 mark of the track is actually one of the stronger blips of Walter&#039;s vocal performance on the whole album. And I love the music in the chorus too with the almost bad notes on the guitars getting to jingle-ring out, with the nice synth layers. Love it!

Also, it&#039;s a great example of how two things can sound virtually nothing alike, and yet still very strongly remind you of one another. The opening of the track reminds me of some of the weirder moments from the &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; album by, of course, Genesis. And as we get into the song, we stick with Steve Hackett, who I also love, and some of the goofier stuff he did, like &quot;Ballad of the Decomposing Man&quot;.

In total, no, I don&#039;t think of the song as pointless or aimless at all. 

b) This is less of a disagreement per se, and more of a sense of a key aspect in the lyrics to Surf and/or Die being missed. Here&#039;s this horribly tragic and traumatic event that is supposedly based on a true story, and to someone that Walter knew and loved, and rather than it being this deeply moving, rousing, stirring emotional moment, it&#039;s treated with this studied detached, emotionless coolness that manifests itself in the cold practicality of logistics in the first verse (finding the car keys, call Grandma, calm down Suzie, etc), and then sheer abstract thought in the second verse. 

It&#039;s delivered in a nearly emotionless, nearly deadpan vocal performance, and even the music is basically a two-chord drone throughout with Buddhist monk chants to bookend, and peppered throughout. 

As such, this is actually my number one favorite song ever in terms of how it treats the subject of death. Leave it Walter. It&#039;s so powerful precisely because of its studied illusion of powerlessness, and in its purposeful neutrality is probably ten times as rousing, fitting, and meaningful a tribute to his dearly departed friend as the most rousing string-filled tear-jerker you could ever imagine.

3) Only tangentially related, but I actually rather like Kamakiriad. I think it&#039;s a marvelous album, although I will freely grant that a number of its very &quot;time piece&quot; arrangement choices have aged much less gracefully than the more timeless sounds of Nightfly, Morph the Cat, or even Sunken Condos.

Beyond that, I think I agree with every word you said! A great review of a great album that was - and still is - quite underappreciated!
