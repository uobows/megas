Three ways Christ makes a difference.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>First, Christ makes the difference of bringing forgiveness.</i><br /><i>It seems to me that our society is less forgiving.</i><br /><i>And let me point out that there is a difference&nbsp;</i><br /><i>between a society that forgives,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and a society that decides that what used to be wrong, no longer is.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>So, to use an example: we have many people&nbsp;</i><br /><i>who have come to our country in violation of the laws.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Most people agree this is a problem;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Where we disagree is over the right solution.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>In the midst of this we have two notable phenomena:</i><br /><i>First, that there is a hardness of some people?s hearts</i><br /><i>when it comes to forgiving the transgression of the law;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and second, a growing insistence by others that</i><br /><i>there was nothing actually wrong with breaking the law&nbsp;</i><br /><i>in the first place.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But you see, these go hand-in-hand: if you cannot hope for forgiveness,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>you aren?t going to admit you are wrong.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Does that sound familiar, married couples?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Many people find it hard to forgive; and it often is very hard.</i><br /><i>Let me just point out that there isn?t anyone here,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>over the age of, say, two, who hasn?t been forgiven,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>both generously and continuously through your life.</i><br /><i>Much of it you aren?t even aware of, or you?re forgotten.</i><br /><i>Don?t believe me? Ask your parents!</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The power to forgive comes from Christ. And remember,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that is why he came. He was born, knowing that he would die.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>The wood of the manger in which he lay&nbsp;</i><br /><i>foreshadowed the wood of the Cross on which he would say,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.?</i><br /><i>And that is all of us.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Another difference Christ makes?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>He came to give us the power to change.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Now, a lot of us will say, but I don?t change!&nbsp;</i><br /><i>When I go to confession,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>I keep bringing the same sins over and over.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>I never seem to overcome my bad habits.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>It is true that change comes hard and slow.</i><br /><i>And yet it will come, if we are humble enough to ask God?s help.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Meanwhile there are miracles of change that happen all the time;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>they serve to show just how powerful the Holy Spirit is,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>when we truly yield to him.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>I think of a man named Charles Colson.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>In the 60s and 70s, he was a rising political activist.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>He reached a position of great power in the Nixon White House ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>only to be brought low by his own pride;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>he was, by his own admission, ?ruthless? in pursuing political power.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>One of his boasts was instigating a riot that left 70 people injured;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and he helped destroy the good names of many people.</i><br /><i>When he went to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>he was a much hated man.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>But the prayers and witness of Christians around him,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>along with humiliation of his fall from power, changed Chuck Colson.</i><br /><i>He went on to spend almost 40 years ? until his death ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>working for prison reform&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and to be a voice for those society often prefers to forget about.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>When he died in 2012,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>he had been honored around the world for his good work.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>What had changed him? Christ changed him.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Finally, let me note one more difference Christ makes:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>His coming into the world lets us know that no matter what we face,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and however alone you or I may feel,</i><br /><i>We are never actually alone.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Christmas isn?t just about God communicating to the world;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>he has done that countless times through the ages.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But as the letter to the Hebrews says,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?in these last days, he has spoken to us through the Son? ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>who was born of the Virgin Mary.

This sequence is awfully important, as will shortly become clear...<br /><br />The current situation is: if you are a Catholic man, and you think you want to be a priest, you know: if you choose that path, you do not get married. That's how it is, right now.<br /><br />So what's being talked about is, well, how about we open the door to men being married, first -- and then they can train to be priests. Won't that mean more priests?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />In fact, it will <i>collapse vocations.</i> It will destroy them.<br /><br />Wow, that's harsh. How can I say that?<br /><br />Right now there are about 60 or so men training for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Most of them are young, in their 20s or 30s; a few older. They entered the seminary knowing that if they go forward, they are foregoing marriage. They can be a priest, or they can be married. They can't do both.<br /><br />And -- remember what I said in the second paragraph -- they know that once they are ordained a priest, there will <i>never</i> be an option for a priest to be married. Why? Because there never has been, and no one in the Church is proposing changing that.<br /><br />So imagine the pope announces: we're changing it; now you can be married first, then ordained. Or even, we're looking at it.<br /><br />How many of those 60 men starts thinking: you know what? This means I can get married, first -- and <i>then</i> be ordained later! Why not do that? The pope just said, married priests are great; so why shouldn't I be a <i>married</i> priest?<br /><br />Fast-forward, the decision is made: now married men will be accepted as candidates for orders. And here I am, in Russia, Ohio, promoting the priesthood. And here's the conversation I have with a high school boy:<br /><br />Fox: "You should think about being a priest. You're dedicated to prayer, you love the Mass, you help people -- you'd be a great priest."<br /><br />H.S. boy: "Thanks Father, but I don't know, I think about being married. Didn't the pope say I could do both?"<br /><br />Fox: "Well, yes he did."<br /><br />H.S. boy: "And, didn't he say I have to marry first? Right?"<br /><br />Fox: "That's right."<br /><br />H.S. boy: "Well, OK then, I think I'll wait."<br /><br />And why shouldn't he? Why should any young man not wait and see if marriage works out, first? He can always go to the seminary later, right? But if he goes first, then no marriage.<br /><br />Please tell me why this change wouldn't empty out our seminaries, as lots of young men decide they will see how marriage works out -- and either, if it doesn't, <i>then</i> they can enter; or else, if they do get married, they can pursue the priesthood after things settle down in their marriage. Say, when they are 50 or so.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking. Oh, but instead of all those 20 year olds, you'll get eager 50 year olds.

You get married, you raise kids, you have a job, career, business; and you're going to drop all that to enter the seminary? C'mon. It is precisely when you are single that you can maybe do this; and speaking as someone who was single in my 20s and in my 30s, 40s and 50s, it just gets harder to do things like this as you get older. You get tied down, even without a wife and children. Do you really think it's easy for a man who is married and has children -- maybe grandchildren -- to say, OK, now I'm entering the seminary?<br /><br />It won't be a 1:1 ratio, but even if it were, it needs to be about a 1:5 ratio. That is, for every 20-something young man we lose, we need to pick up at least 5 older men. Why?

Maybe it was the success of last week's turkey? In any case, yesterday I fixed an old standby, pot roast. I've done this before:<br /><br />1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees.<br />2. Heat oil or other fat (sometimes I use bacon fat) in a dutch oven.<br />3. Season chuck roast with plenty of salt and pepper, and dredge in flour.<br />4. Brown roast on both sides.<br />5. Cut up celery and carrots, halve a couple of onions. How much? Whatever you like. If you have potatoes or mushrooms, you can throw those in too. (I added some leftover mushrooms this time.)<br />6. After meat is browned, add a few cups water, or beef or vegetable broth or stock if you had it. Also add a cup or two of wine (red or white; I prefer dry to sweet).<br />7. Add any other flavors you like. I added some leftover garlic puree I found in the fridge, as well as some red pepper flakes, and a bay leaf.<br />8. Cover and place in oven.<br /><br />By the way, this works in a crock pot, but I don't have one, and my counter is crowded enough; so this simply turns my oven into a crock pot.<br /><br />How long to cook? I cooked it around six hours; I think it might have been better with another hour or two. Also, you can cook it at a higher temperature, but I think it comes out better if you cook it low and slow.<br /><br />How was it? Really good! I think it will be even better when I have the leftovers later this week.<br /><br />And then, this morning, I decided to start on a chicken, which I'll cook tomorrow. I decided to brine it, so I washed the bird, and then placed it in the same dutch oven; I boiled some water and coarse salt to dissolve it, along with some ground pepper and red pepper flakes. How much? Whatever you like! I put in about two tablespoons of salt, but you could go more or less. I poured this over the chicken, and added more water, until the chicken was covered by the water. I had a lime that was getting shriveled, so I cut that up and threw it in.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OH20ZAksfwk/Wh7CYDwAHqI/AAAAAAAAC74/88E78JcJqYgYPchsirXzbYd8sFhIsJ2ngCLcBGAs/s1600/20171129_091838.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OH20ZAksfwk/Wh7CYDwAHqI/AAAAAAAAC74/88E78JcJqYgYPchsirXzbYd8sFhIsJ2ngCLcBGAs/s400/20171129_091838.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />My plan is to let that soak for most of today, then I'll remove the chicken from the brine and let it dry out in the fridge overnight. When it's ready to roast, I'll rub the whole thing in butter and sprinkle it with pepper and salt, and stuff it with cut up lemons and rosemary. Hey! I just got an idea! I'm going to go throw some of the rosemary in the brine; I never use it all anyway! Stay tuned.<br /><br />Update, 4:25 pm, 11/30/17<br /><br />Last night I dumped out the brine; I can't remember if I rinsed it too. After drying it off a bit, I put it back in the fridge so the skin could dry out. This morning I got it out and flipped it, so the other side could dry as well.<br /><br />About 3 pm, I got it out, and as I often do (this is a recipe from the inimitable <a href="http://wdtprs.com/blog/">Fr. Z</a>), I stuffed the bird with rosemary sprigs and a cut up lemon, then rubbed the chicken with butter, then sprinkled generously with salt and pepper. Frequently, however, the chicken is too wet and the butter doesn't spread; that happened this time, despite all; so I added some olive oil.<br /><br />Here's the chicken ready to go in the oven:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p5Lk5GicPos/WiB2rJYMGLI/AAAAAAAAC9A/6CsQbP-xVdcvBkr5awwDg6-MsefcVgSRQCLcBGAs/s1600/20171130_145945.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p5Lk5GicPos/WiB2rJYMGLI/AAAAAAAAC9A/6CsQbP-xVdcvBkr5awwDg6-MsefcVgSRQCLcBGAs/s400/20171130_145945.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />As you can see, there are some lumps of butter that didn't spread; of course that'll melt. You can also see I placed it bottom's up -- i.e., breast down. Later, I'll turn on the broiler and flip it, letting the broiler crisp up the skin on the breast side. I can't say it ends up as crispy and nice as it would otherwise, but it's a nice trade off to get really moist breast meat.<br /><br />I'm cooking it at about 225 degrees, so this will take longer. The picture doesn't show the thermometer, which I just remembered and went and stuck in the thigh. I'm hoping this will either be finished by 6:30, or else won't finish till 8:30, which is when I come back from Benediction.<br /><br /><b><span style="color: red;">Update, 5:53 pm...</span></b><br /><br />Here is the finished chicken! <i>Ecce, pullam!&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K80H-HYS8AE/WiCMTESltEI/AAAAAAAAC9g/ShihZO7asT0Y2R97ERTN1k06QXRikdoCQCLcBGAs/s1600/20171130_174252.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K80H-HYS8AE/WiCMTESltEI/AAAAAAAAC9g/ShihZO7asT0Y2R97ERTN1k06QXRikdoCQCLcBGAs/s400/20171130_174252.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><i><br /></i>I checked it around 5:25 pm, and it the thermometer showed it finished. So I flipped it, and then placed it back in. I had to run out for a few minutes, and I got back around 5:45; at which point I turned on the broiler. After a few minutes, it looked like this, so I pulled it out. I removed the items from the insides and threw them away. The juice -- of which there was a lot -- I poured off into a container to save for later. After cutting myself some pieces, I put the rest away.<br /><br />Verdict?<br /><br />It's mighty good. It wasn't salty enough for me, which surprised me. Perhaps I could have used more salt in the brine. Also, it isn't as redolent of rosemary as I thought it might be, given that I put some in the brine; but I didn't break it up too much. Maybe next time, I'll pulverize the rosemary, so more of its goodness migrates via the solution to the muscle fibers of the chicken.<br /><br />The skin is quite good; as always, the topside skin isn't as crispy as it would be had I cooked it topside from the beginning, but as I said above, it's a fair trade-off. And since I cooked it at a lower temperature, the color wasn't as dark, but it still was reasonably crispy.<br /><br />And, actually, I think I could have brought it out a bit earlier, but it isn't overcooked. I didn't expect it to finish this early, which makes me think my oven was hotter than I realized.<br /><br />Just now I polished off the thigh, and it was superb! I'm a thigh man, myself. It's surrounded with a good layer of fat, and has lots of meat but only two bones; so when it's cooked right, the fat melts away, but the meat is so juicy and flavorful. I think it's best meat on a chicken, apart from the "oyster."<br /><br />So that's the chicken. If you are keeping score, I now have two nice containers of leftovers: pot roast from Monday, and this chicken. I'm almost sorry I'm full, because I can't wait for the leftovers!";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://frmartinfox.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-ive-been-cooking.html";s:6:"author";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Fr Martin Fox)";s:7:"summary";s:7605:"<b><i><span style="color: red;">Updated, below...</span></i></b><br /><br />For whatever reason, I'm on a burst of actual cooking lately.

I can't say it ends up as crispy and nice as it would otherwise, but it's a nice trade off to get really moist breast meat.<br /><br />I'm cooking it at about 225 degrees, so this will take longer. The picture doesn't show the thermometer, which I just remembered and went and stuck in the thigh. I'm hoping this will either be finished by 6:30, or else won't finish till 8:30, which is when I come back from Benediction.<br /><br /><b><span style="color: red;">Update, 5:53 pm...</span></b><br /><br />Here is the finished chicken! <i>Ecce, pullam!&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K80H-HYS8AE/WiCMTESltEI/AAAAAAAAC9g/ShihZO7asT0Y2R97ERTN1k06QXRikdoCQCLcBGAs/s1600/20171130_174252.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K80H-HYS8AE/WiCMTESltEI/AAAAAAAAC9g/ShihZO7asT0Y2R97ERTN1k06QXRikdoCQCLcBGAs/s400/20171130_174252.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><i><br /></i>I checked it around 5:25 pm, and it the thermometer showed it finished. So I flipped it, and then placed it back in. I had to run out for a few minutes, and I got back around 5:45; at which point I turned on the broiler. After a few minutes, it looked like this, so I pulled it out. I removed the items from the insides and threw them away. The juice -- of which there was a lot -- I poured off into a container to save for later. After cutting myself some pieces, I put the rest away.<br /><br />Verdict?<br /><br />It's mighty good. It wasn't salty enough for me, which surprised me. Perhaps I could have used more salt in the brine. Also, it isn't as redolent of rosemary as I thought it might be, given that I put some in the brine; but I didn't break it up too much. Maybe next time, I'll pulverize the rosemary, so more of its goodness migrates via the solution to the muscle fibers of the chicken.<br /><br />The skin is quite good; as always, the topside skin isn't as crispy as it would be had I cooked it topside from the beginning, but as I said above, it's a fair trade-off. And since I cooked it at a lower temperature, the color wasn't as dark, but it still was reasonably crispy.<br /><br />And, actually, I think I could have brought it out a bit earlier, but it isn't overcooked. I didn't expect it to finish this early, which makes me think my oven was hotter than I realized.<br /><br />Just now I polished off the thigh, and it was superb! I'm a thigh man, myself. It's surrounded with a good layer of fat, and has lots of meat but only two bones; so when it's cooked right, the fat melts away, but the meat is so juicy and flavorful. I think it's best meat on a chicken, apart from the "oyster."<br /><br />So that's the chicken. If you are keeping score, I now have two nice containers of leftovers: pot roast from Monday, and this chicken. I'm almost sorry I'm full, because I can't wait for the leftovers!";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1511965380;}i:11;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14168956.post-3302956151827611406";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 00:30:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:16:"Sorry, no homily";s:11:"description";s:56:"...because the deacon gave the homily this past weekend.";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://frmartinfox.blogspot.com/2017/11/sorry-no-homily.html";s:6:"author";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Fr Martin Fox)";s:7:"summary";s:56:"...because the deacon gave the homily this past weekend.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1511829000;}i:12;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14168956.post-7830699757795031078";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 15:46:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:17:"Ecce, Meleagris!*";s:11:"description";s:2450:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Here is the turkey, out of the oven yesterday around 11 am:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_914226dI5E/Whg7_qauTwI/AAAAAAAAC7U/WvUWnUyI7qsxYGca5x_D6UbL9onLrLE2ACLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_110518.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_914226dI5E/Whg7_qauTwI/AAAAAAAAC7U/WvUWnUyI7qsxYGca5x_D6UbL9onLrLE2ACLcBGAs/s400/20171123_110518.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And here is how it arrived to the party in Cincinnati:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9uRuQokz6I/Whg8VAJwkCI/AAAAAAAAC7Y/iVkzdqaYCkQhGhkKEb3ui8bmsqO47Z4VwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_133114.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9uRuQokz6I/Whg8VAJwkCI/AAAAAAAAC7Y/iVkzdqaYCkQhGhkKEb3ui8bmsqO47Z4VwCLcBGAs/s320/20171123_133114.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>This worked pretty well.

But I'd already stuffed the thorax, so I only put a little in the neck and closed that up with a toothpick.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zGm_7aJRKGw/WhbkDbTRuDI/AAAAAAAAC5o/Zp6aysJyfcwRm4UBfn7pjtbLauZgolJSQCLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_040140.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zGm_7aJRKGw/WhbkDbTRuDI/AAAAAAAAC5o/Zp6aysJyfcwRm4UBfn7pjtbLauZgolJSQCLcBGAs/s400/20171123_040140.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Since I wasn't going to cook the turkey breast down, I covered the breast section with aluminum foil, and into the oven at 4 am. I then remembered the thermometer, and so I put that in, poking through the foil (not shown).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a1WAKaQg4XI/WhbkGM6oV9I/AAAAAAAAC5s/S1YnfAAG-n0L2NClsCraJJ5R3eda1myNACLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_040251.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a1WAKaQg4XI/WhbkGM6oV9I/AAAAAAAAC5s/S1YnfAAG-n0L2NClsCraJJ5R3eda1myNACLcBGAs/s400/20171123_040251.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So back to bed I went, but I didn't really fall asleep. I was up again around 7 am to shower and shave, and head over to church for Lauds and Mass. The turkey was fine.<br /><br />After breakfast, I remembered I needed to fix the stock, that would be the base for gravy later. So I cut up an onion and a stalk of celery, and sauteed these in butter.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cHm0kBfwVC8/WhbkIv2eTHI/AAAAAAAAC5w/CBu9_h7WkiAocXeabMvHqH-S6Xyk9uKeQCLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_095148.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cHm0kBfwVC8/WhbkIv2eTHI/AAAAAAAAC5w/CBu9_h7WkiAocXeabMvHqH-S6Xyk9uKeQCLcBGAs/s400/20171123_095148.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I had bought "Bone Broth" in case I needed extra liquid for the stuffing (ho, ho!), and as I hadn't used it, I made use of it here, instead of water. That went in, plus a bay leaf, plus salt and pepper, and of course, the turkey innards -- sans the liver, which Martha Stewart says shouldn't be cooked too long. So that'll go in later.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zeFzswc4gv0/WhbkJcZZcFI/AAAAAAAAC50/ouYUgZOEKmMl2vuLpI3oqfmIuTSEu-VBwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171123_095429.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zeFzswc4gv0/WhbkJcZZcFI/AAAAAAAAC50/ouYUgZOEKmMl2vuLpI3oqfmIuTSEu-VBwCLcBGAs/s400/20171123_095429.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Here is the stock, on the way to a boil.

Here are more pictures with more narrative. After I offered Holy Mass at the nearby nursing home, I went to the parish hall with my box of supplies, above. (Hint: I put two items in the box by mistake; they were not needed for this particular task after all.) The recipe I was following called for me to simmer some water with coarse salt, coriander, bay leaves, mustard seed, fennel seed and black pepper. It called for whole coriander and black peppercorns, but I had ground coriander, so I used that. And I couldn't figure out how to remove the grinder-top off the jar of black pepper I had from the store, without breaking it, so I simply ground it in. Here is that concoction simmering:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeQPgD5EzAI/WhSZRdBsn3I/AAAAAAAAC14/3YldzlnvSRgFD3R8wVPs09BadJDeHJXrgCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_152529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeQPgD5EzAI/WhSZRdBsn3I/AAAAAAAAC14/3YldzlnvSRgFD3R8wVPs09BadJDeHJXrgCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_152529.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />The same recipe called for some dry Riesling wine, and sliced onions. I decided to leave the brown skins on, but I did cut off the ends.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zt2204LRkaw/WhSZRaTKksI/AAAAAAAAC18/D9xACuiW3-YgMdmG8Gswy96NO2qBEyhCwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_153550.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zt2204LRkaw/WhSZRaTKksI/AAAAAAAAC18/D9xACuiW3-YgMdmG8Gswy96NO2qBEyhCwCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_153550.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And here is all of it, poured over a 24 pound turkey, which is in a clean garbage bag, in a very large pot. After this, I tied the bag and placed the whole thing in the walk-in cooler. This, plus the very large pots, are why I did this at the parish hall.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mo8KDWrdK2Y/WhSZRGO0FpI/AAAAAAAAC10/DTWPPw-M0LAmidPGmCuojtunRWc0S0ZhwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_155459.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mo8KDWrdK2Y/WhSZRGO0FpI/AAAAAAAAC10/DTWPPw-M0LAmidPGmCuojtunRWc0S0ZhwCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_155459.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />All this marinates for 24 hours or so. What I didn't photograph was my last-minute decision to add more of everything, when I saw that the liquid didn't cover the turkey. So I simmered some more salt and spices, and thankfully I had bought a second bottle of wine, which I dumped in. The proportions will be off, but I don't think that matters very much. That is to say, it may matter to Martha Stewart, whose brine recipe this was, but it doesn't much matter to <i>me</i>. (I'd already left out the juniper berries, because Kroger didn't have them, and I had already decided I wasn't going anywhere else for them.)<br /><br /><b><span style="color: red;">Update, 11/22, 4:22 pm...</span></b><br /><b><span style="color: red;"><br /></span></b>Here is a progress report, with more pictures!<br /><br />Here is the turkey, having emerged from its bath. It was going to be 24 hours, but I got antsy. Here it is in the refrigerator, so that the skin dries out. The plan is for me to rise at 4 am, get this thing out of the fridge without dropping it, and then getting the stuffing ready to go inside it. I have been resisting the 4 am wake-up, but I can find no way around it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyX-ytC-2ys/WhXqBdaMyzI/AAAAAAAAC24/vWda7vc8X4AG--QdVsrCwPC2Q12BKxlJACLcBGAs/s1600/20171122_160721.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyX-ytC-2ys/WhXqBdaMyzI/AAAAAAAAC24/vWda7vc8X4AG--QdVsrCwPC2Q12BKxlJACLcBGAs/s320/20171122_160721.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Meanwhile, I did what prep I could for the stuffing. This is equal parts cornbread and white bread (the picture is deceptive: this is a very large bowl).<br /><br />Everything else is wet, so I will wait till the wee hours to finish the stuffing. I have no idea whether I'll have too much -- I'm hoping!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wmUOXZkgw8/WhXqCe70zgI/AAAAAAAAC28/mks8ytUHBIwxMaSBFCYib7ewg6t74uriwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171122_161401.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wmUOXZkgw8/WhXqCe70zgI/AAAAAAAAC28/mks8ytUHBIwxMaSBFCYib7ewg6t74uriwCLcBGAs/s320/20171122_161401.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Meanwhile, I have been busy with other matters. I had purchased a disposable baking pan; however, it was too flimsy. So one of my crack staff kindly brought one from home. Also, I verified that the cooler I will use to transport the turkey, with stuffing, broth and fixings for gravy, will actually fit in my car. The good news is that it will indeed fit. The bad news is that, once in the car, I can barely open the lid. That means the cooler can only go in the car loaded; so another of my crack staff kindly volunteered to come over tomorrow around 11 am and help me load this in my car.<br /><br />Also, I also got a couple more onions, just because -- and duct tape. Why duct tape? A parishioner -- whose brother is the king of roast pork hereabouts -- swears by his technique of keeping the roast pork in a cooler for the last hour of cooking; and it must be taped shut! With duct tape! So we aren't messing around here.<br /><br />I forgot to take a picture of the oven mitts I bought, which are silicone or something like that. These will be handy tomorrow morning, after morning Mass, when I flip the bird topside again, to brown the breast meat. That's right: I'm going to cook the turkey backside up. That is my solution for avoiding the breast being overcooked.";s:4:"link";s:85:"http://frmartinfox.blogspot.com/2017/11/can-you-guess-what-father-fox-is-cooking.html";s:6:"author";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Fr Martin Fox)";s:7:"summary";s:11756:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Some of my readers, here in the parish, have been asking me for more cooking posts.

Here are more pictures with more narrative. After I offered Holy Mass at the nearby nursing home, I went to the parish hall with my box of supplies, above. (Hint: I put two items in the box by mistake; they were not needed for this particular task after all.) The recipe I was following called for me to simmer some water with coarse salt, coriander, bay leaves, mustard seed, fennel seed and black pepper. It called for whole coriander and black peppercorns, but I had ground coriander, so I used that. And I couldn't figure out how to remove the grinder-top off the jar of black pepper I had from the store, without breaking it, so I simply ground it in. Here is that concoction simmering:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeQPgD5EzAI/WhSZRdBsn3I/AAAAAAAAC14/3YldzlnvSRgFD3R8wVPs09BadJDeHJXrgCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_152529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeQPgD5EzAI/WhSZRdBsn3I/AAAAAAAAC14/3YldzlnvSRgFD3R8wVPs09BadJDeHJXrgCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_152529.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />The same recipe called for some dry Riesling wine, and sliced onions. I decided to leave the brown skins on, but I did cut off the ends.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zt2204LRkaw/WhSZRaTKksI/AAAAAAAAC18/D9xACuiW3-YgMdmG8Gswy96NO2qBEyhCwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_153550.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zt2204LRkaw/WhSZRaTKksI/AAAAAAAAC18/D9xACuiW3-YgMdmG8Gswy96NO2qBEyhCwCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_153550.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And here is all of it, poured over a 24 pound turkey, which is in a clean garbage bag, in a very large pot. After this, I tied the bag and placed the whole thing in the walk-in cooler. This, plus the very large pots, are why I did this at the parish hall.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mo8KDWrdK2Y/WhSZRGO0FpI/AAAAAAAAC10/DTWPPw-M0LAmidPGmCuojtunRWc0S0ZhwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171121_155459.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mo8KDWrdK2Y/WhSZRGO0FpI/AAAAAAAAC10/DTWPPw-M0LAmidPGmCuojtunRWc0S0ZhwCLcBGAs/s320/20171121_155459.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />All this marinates for 24 hours or so. What I didn't photograph was my last-minute decision to add more of everything, when I saw that the liquid didn't cover the turkey. So I simmered some more salt and spices, and thankfully I had bought a second bottle of wine, which I dumped in. The proportions will be off, but I don't think that matters very much. That is to say, it may matter to Martha Stewart, whose brine recipe this was, but it doesn't much matter to <i>me</i>. (I'd already left out the juniper berries, because Kroger didn't have them, and I had already decided I wasn't going anywhere else for them.)<br /><br /><b><span style="color: red;">Update, 11/22, 4:22 pm...</span></b><br /><b><span style="color: red;"><br /></span></b>Here is a progress report, with more pictures!<br /><br />Here is the turkey, having emerged from its bath. It was going to be 24 hours, but I got antsy. Here it is in the refrigerator, so that the skin dries out. The plan is for me to rise at 4 am, get this thing out of the fridge without dropping it, and then getting the stuffing ready to go inside it. I have been resisting the 4 am wake-up, but I can find no way around it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyX-ytC-2ys/WhXqBdaMyzI/AAAAAAAAC24/vWda7vc8X4AG--QdVsrCwPC2Q12BKxlJACLcBGAs/s1600/20171122_160721.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyX-ytC-2ys/WhXqBdaMyzI/AAAAAAAAC24/vWda7vc8X4AG--QdVsrCwPC2Q12BKxlJACLcBGAs/s320/20171122_160721.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Meanwhile, I did what prep I could for the stuffing. This is equal parts cornbread and white bread (the picture is deceptive: this is a very large bowl).<br /><br />Everything else is wet, so I will wait till the wee hours to finish the stuffing. I have no idea whether I'll have too much -- I'm hoping!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wmUOXZkgw8/WhXqCe70zgI/AAAAAAAAC28/mks8ytUHBIwxMaSBFCYib7ewg6t74uriwCLcBGAs/s1600/20171122_161401.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wmUOXZkgw8/WhXqCe70zgI/AAAAAAAAC28/mks8ytUHBIwxMaSBFCYib7ewg6t74uriwCLcBGAs/s320/20171122_161401.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Meanwhile, I have been busy with other matters. I had purchased a disposable baking pan; however, it was too flimsy. So one of my crack staff kindly brought one from home. Also, I verified that the cooler I will use to transport the turkey, with stuffing, broth and fixings for gravy, will actually fit in my car. The good news is that it will indeed fit. The bad news is that, once in the car, I can barely open the lid. That means the cooler can only go in the car loaded; so another of my crack staff kindly volunteered to come over tomorrow around 11 am and help me load this in my car.<br /><br />Also, I also got a couple more onions, just because -- and duct tape. Why duct tape? A parishioner -- whose brother is the king of roast pork hereabouts -- swears by his technique of keeping the roast pork in a cooler for the last hour of cooking; and it must be taped shut! With duct tape! So we aren't messing around here.<br /><br />I forgot to take a picture of the oven mitts I bought, which are silicone or something like that. These will be handy tomorrow morning, after morning Mass, when I flip the bird topside again, to brown the breast meat. That's right: I'm going to cook the turkey backside up. That is my solution for avoiding the breast being overcooked.";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1511280900;}i:15;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14168956.post-4969458893350813347";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:05:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:25:"Please pray for my sister";s:11:"description";s:248:"In your charity, please pray for my sister, who is very ill.

and it tells the story&nbsp;</i><br /><i>of a boy who grows up in a neighborhood&nbsp;</i><br /><i>where there?s a gangster who seems really glamorous,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and the boy is drawn into the mobster?s orbit.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>His father wants nothing to do with crime,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>even though there?s easy money in it for him.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And one time he pulls his son away from hanging out with the crooks.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>His boy is upset, and parrots what the mob boss says:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that working people are ?suckers.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>And the father tells his young son,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>"He's wrong, it don't take much strength&nbsp;</i><br /><i>to pull the trigger but try and get up every morning day after day&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and work for a living, let's see him try that.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Then we'll see who's the real tough guy.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>The working man is the tough guy."</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>This year, Pope Francis has started a new tradition;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>he has designated this day the ?World Day for the Poor.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>This is as good a time as any to remember&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that whatever challenges any of us have&nbsp;</i><br /><i>with paying our bills or making ends meet,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>how blessed you and I are in comparison to&nbsp;</i><br /><i>the full reality of poverty and privation.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Even the poverty we see in this country is far different&nbsp;</i><br /><i>from what people face in so many other places.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>When we think about it, we may be tempted to say,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>it?s all so overwhelming, what can I do?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>That risks making the same mistake as the third servant in the Gospel,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>who said the very same thing.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And he buried what resources he did have,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and made absolutely no use of them.</i><br /><br /><i>As you know, there is a second collection today&nbsp;</i><br /><i>for the Campaign for Human Development.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>The bishops, who created this fund,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>have the purpose of helping people escape poverty.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>I will be very candid with you:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>I know that many people have serious questions&nbsp;</i><br /><i>about how these funds are spent,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>because over the years there have, indeed, been misjudgments&nbsp;</i><br /><i>in where the money was sent.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>I was as unhappy about that as you have been.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>All I can do is to repeat to you what the Archbishop has said:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that he and the other bishops&nbsp;</i><br /><i>are making every effort to avoid having this money&nbsp;</i><br /><i>go to any organizations promoting abortion or same-sex marriage&nbsp;</i><br /><i>or other things in conflict with Catholic teaching.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But if you have qualms, and do not wish to contribute,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that is entirely your decision.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>That said, may I then make this suggestion?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Look for another way to help people rise from poverty.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Don?t just put your resources in a hole and do nothing.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Just to wrap this up.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>It?s pretty common for us to compare ourselves to others.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>There is always someone who has more money, more good looks,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>more ability, more opportunity, than it seems you or I have.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But what really are the best gifts Jesus has given us?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Is it money? Is it good looks or a great job or a fancy car?</i><br /><i>No, of course not!</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Here are the best gifts Jesus gives us.</i><br /><i>He gives us forgiveness of our sins.</i><br /><i>He gives us the Holy Spirit to guide us.</i><br /><i>He gives us grace, that will ? if we cooperate ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>make us saints and take us to heaven.</i><br /><i>And he gave you your life, which you may doubt is worth much,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>but Jesus considers priceless, because he died for you.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Is it really true that you don?t have much?</i><br /><i>Is not rather true that you and I have everything?</i><br /><i>Rich in Christ!

Aren?t you a Christian??&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And they will say, I was, but I am not any longer.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And it might be a disappointment or hurt;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and many will admit they just drifted away;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>but again, there will be those who will say forthrightly,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?I am not prepared to be a Catholic because?? and then explain why.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>There is something to respect in people&nbsp;</i><br /><i>at least realizing that following Jesus Christ is not a trivial matter,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>but the most serious decision.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Then we have the guest who gets thrown out.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>He takes it all very lightly.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>This is the person who says, sure, I?ll be a godparent for a baptism,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>even though he or she doesn?t make living the Faith a priority.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>How can someone agree to be a sponsor for baptism or confirmation ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>which means, you will model the Faith by your life ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>when you know you?re not doing that?&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>And I know how painful it is not to be able to invite family or friends&nbsp;</i><br /><i>to be godparents, but it?s a very solemn responsibility.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And if you can?t find suitable godparents, come and talk to me.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>This guest without the wedding garment&nbsp;</i><br /><i>is someone who fundamentally misunderstands what Jesus asks.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Our Faith is not like sales tax.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>You go to the store, you pay the tax,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and that satisfies the state. You go on as you like.</i><br /><i>Some people imagine being Catholic is like that.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>I check off the boxes, I?ve done my duty,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and then I do as I please.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But that is not Christianity. That is not our Catholic Faith.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>You know what that is? It is a warmed-over paganism.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>In the time of the Apostles,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>this is precisely how the pagans approached religion.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Zeus or Aphrodite or Mithras or whatever gods you worshipped,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>were almost never the center of life.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>You made your periodic sacrifices,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>you showed up for a religious holiday, and then you lived as you like.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But what does Jesus say?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?I am the way, the truth and the life,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>no one comes to the Father except through me.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And, ?If you are not with me, you are against me.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And, he said, ?If you would be my disciple, take up your?Cross&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and follow me.? To follow Jesus is to be all in. He is the King.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>What Jesus offers us is costly, but it is also a super-abundance of life.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Nothing is more demanding, and yet it is to drink Life from the Source.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>What could be better?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Notice what was that guest invited to? To a wedding, to a feast.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And remember, he wasn?t one of the rich swells who was used to this; he was poor and hungry.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The future that Jesus opens up for us? There is no upper scale.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>There is no upper limit to how much abundance&nbsp;</i><br /><i>of life and joy and peace and fulfillment will be ours&nbsp;</i><br /><i>on that mountain where death is destroyed forever!</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>You and I are bidden to that wedding;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and all Jesus asks is, ?give me your heart. Say yes to me, as your King.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>The marriage is between the Son of God&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and the People he has called to himself.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Our destiny is something breathtaking and shocking to say:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>we will be united with God!&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>In three weeks our parish will have a mission,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>with Father Nathan Cromly.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>The title of the mission is, ?Discovering Joyful Catholicism.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Our Faith is demanding, and yet it is a Feast.</i><br /><i>There?s a funny old movie called ?Auntie Mame,? and she says,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death.?&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>That banquet is our Catholic Faith:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>an abundance of truth about who God is and who we are.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Tables groaning with mercy for all who want it,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and we can go back, again and again.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>A flood of grace that gives us strength to be people&nbsp;</i><br /><i>we could never be otherwise.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>And a life ? in this world and the world to come ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>that is worth everything we give, to have.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Because that life is Jesus Christ himself.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>So, first, if you need your batteries recharged ? and who doesn?t? ?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>then come to this mission. The dates are November 6-8,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>and Fr. Cromly will give a talk in church&nbsp;</i><br /><i>on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>There are other events planned for our children and teens to meet him.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Each night will include time for prayer and priests to hear confessions.</i><br /><i>And if you need a reason to go, the theme is your answer: do you want, do you need,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>to discover more joy in your Catholic Faith?&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Who doesn?t?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Second, this is what Jesus sends us out to bring others to share.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>If you wonder what it costs to follow Jesus, how about this:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Right now, it ?costs? each of us looking around for people to invite.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>There are flyers at the doors, feel free to take one.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>We?ll have more next week.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Pray for the people who you might want to invite, starting today.&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Pray for you to have the courage to say the words,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>to family, friends and neighbors,&nbsp;</i><br /><i>?would you like to come with me to St. Remy?s Parish Mission??&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>And how about this?
