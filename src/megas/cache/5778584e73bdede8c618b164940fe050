<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The recent surge of attention given to sexual harassment has laid bare a long silence about the reality of women?s working lives. As a practitioner and now researcher in sexual harassment law reform, it is a conversation I never imagined taking place on this scale. Yet there are still important gaps in it.</p>
<p>Our thinking around sexual harassment in the workplace is both too much about sex, and not enough. By concentrating on sexual behaviours alone, we overlook women?s non-sexual experiences of being denigrated or undermined at work.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-is-not-enough-it-has-yet-to-shift-the-power-imbalances-that-would-bring-about-gender-equality-92108">#MeToo is not enough: it has yet to shift the power imbalances that would bring about gender equality</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>At the same time, discussions of sexual harassment are also not enough about sex. They ignore one of the most damaging consequences of harassment: the chilling effect on women?s sexual expression and behaviour.</p>
<h2>When sexual harassment is too much about sex</h2>
<p>When we think of sexual harassment, we typically think of a young woman subjected to the unwanted sexual attention of a (usually older) man. This focus on sex suggests that women are disadvantaged by individual acts of sexual aggression, rather than more systemic inequalities. The remedy for sexual harassment then becomes dealing with those individual men, with a select few publicly targeted and losing current positions or contracts.</p>
<p>This approach diminishes the many non-sexual acts that make workplaces hostile to women. These can often be subtle and cumulative.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/business/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/348371/Women-and-the-Future-of-Work-Report_Final_060318.pdf">recent Australian study</a>, women reported ? alongside sexual harassment ? men being preferentially promoted because they were seen as more confident. Women felt they had to to dress differently, or take off a wedding ring to avoid assumptions about child-bearing. They also reported being ?treated like a moron?, and not taken seriously compared to men. These undermining acts are arguably <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-03471-006">even more damaging</a> than sexual harassment.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211508/original/file-20180322-165587-19iplv1.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">In a recent study, women reported forms of discrimination such as men being preferentially promoted because they were perceived as more confident.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/download/confirm/370034096?src=a_7nXoR-eLm--rpI3WWyyw-1-82&amp;size=huge_jpg">Shutterstock</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When women are treated unequally at work because of their sex, this may still be protected as a form of sex discrimination, but non-sexual behaviours have not received the same level of public attention that sexual harassment has. The separation of sexual and non-sexual mistreatment has <a href="http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2002/22.html">artificially created two seemingly distinct categories of gender inequality</a> and channelled attention to the sexual. Non-sexual acts that contribute to women?s inequality are overshadowed by the racier stories of harassment, and since less visible, are even harder to pinpoint and prove.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-exposes-legal-failures-but-trial-by-twitter-isnt-one-of-them-92683">#MeToo exposes legal failures, but ?trial by Twitter' isn?t one of them</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>In law, courts have struggled to characterise certain behaviours as ?sexual? enough to fit within sexual harassment. In 1996, the Supreme Court of Victoria awkwardly held that <a href="https://victorianreports.com.au/judgment/view/1997-2-VR-127">repeated and invasive declarations of love</a> by an employer were ?sexual?, bringing them within the law. In <a href="http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HREOCA/1997/52.html">another case</a>, a discrimination complaint was undermined by treating sexual acts (cutting women?s bra straps in a workplace ritual) as separate from non-sexual acts (calling a senior woman a ?mother hen? and her team the ?nursery?), rather than as evidence of a whole environment hostile to women.</p>
<p><a href="http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2011/35.html">More recently</a>, a case failed when a woman could not show that the series of non-sexual acts she complained of (male colleagues turning off equipment taps so tightly that she could not use them, ignoring her, and being treated as less authoritative than junior male colleagues) were because of her gender. Sexual behaviours by men, in contrast, are presumed to be directed at and harmful to women.</p>
<h2>Sexual harassment is not enough about sex</h2>
<p>The impact of sexual harassment is typically thought of as temporary distress, with a potentially wider professional impact when women lose work opportunities by refusing sexual advances. What has still been overlooked is the impact of sexual harassment on women?s sexual development and agency.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment reverberates far beyond an individual perpetrator or act. The chilling effect of constant low-level policing of sexual boundaries takes a wider toll on women?s sexuality. This is because they are forced to modify themselves ? their appearance, their speech, their interactions with men ? in response to anticipated as well as actual male behaviour.</p>
<p>Young women are particularly subject to sexual harassment, and their sexuality often develops in that context. While around <a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/chapter-1-working-without-fear-results-sexual-harassment-national-telephone-survey-2012-0">a third of Australian women</a> have been sexually harassed, a <a href="http://www.unitedvoicevic.org.au/hospo_sexual_harassment_survey">recent survey of hospitality workers</a>, disproportionately female and young, found 89% had experienced harassment. Actor Natalie Portman <a href="http://time.com/5111739/natalie-portman-times-up-womens-march-speech/">said recently</a> that receiving rape fantasy fan mail and being sexualised in the media as a teenager forced her to adopt a ?prudish? persona to feel safe and respected.</p>
<p>Recent discussions about sexual harassment have largely ignored these significant sexual harms, for which there is little recognition and no legal remedy, while unnecessarily sexualising broader gender inequality.</p>
<p>How can we address these subtle, but serious, harms? Sexual harassment laws have existed in Australia for decades, but addressing inequality takes more than law. We can only fix the damage we can see.</p>
<p>We need to look beyond individual sexual misbehaviour to the wider meaning of sex in sexual harassment, and reform our current laws based on a broader understanding of women?s sexual and non-sexual experiences of inequality.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Many of the workplace conditions we enjoy today ? such as maternity and carer?s leave ? came about through the activism of women in the union movement, but the history of these hard-fought battles is in danger of being lost.</p>
<p>UTS Business School Associate Professor Sarah Kaine and RMIT Professor Cathy Brigden have launched a <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/save-womens-stories">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money for an oral history project that will record these stories for posterity and inspire future generations.</p>
<p>?We realised there was an imbalance in the stories of people who battled to make things better in the workplace. The current recorded history focuses on men ? there is a lack of stories about women who fought for their rights and the rights of those around them,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to seek out 50 women who were activists between 1968 and the present, from a wide range of backgrounds, and record them in their own words via face-to-face interviews. The interviews will then be made available to the public via a web archive.</p>
<p>?There is something really powerful and inspiring about hearing people speak in their own words about their experiences ? hearing them tell stories of everyday bravery that has often come at a personal cost in terms of pressure on them and their families,? says Associate Professor Kaine. </p>
<p>The project will include interviews with senior union figures involved in major campaigns, people like former ACTU president Jennie George, but it will also include lesser-known women, ?everyday heroes? who have inspiring stories of challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>As well as asking for public support to fund the project, the researchers are looking for help in uncovering the women activists who helped shape their workplaces, whether in capital cities or regional areas, and from all cultures and backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of the women already interviewed is cleaner Chris Wagland, a union leader and activist for the rights of workers in the cleaning industry. Wagland has worked as a cleaner for more than 30 years, and became involved in activism when her workplace refused to pay long-service leave and other worker entitlements.</p>
<p>?The biggest barrier is always to get people to take that big leap into the unknown, to put their hands up? that?s the power that people don?t realise they have. No matter how much your voice wavers, or you get upset or your knees shake,? says Wagland.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/235320342">Wagland?s story</a> about how she stepped up and held her ground, despite threats and bullying, is the kind of story the researchers are looking for ? one that will help others realise that change is possible. </p>
<p>The stories will include issues from the late 60s to current times ? from harassment or underpayment, to the gender pay gap, maternity leave, issues with contract work, or continually being a casual or contingent worker.</p>
<p>?We chose 1968 because it was a pivotal time in terms of politics and the women?s movement, and it will enable us to investigate both broader social change, and change across the union movement. This is a living history project, so we will also include current stories,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>In 1968 workplace conditions for women were very different from today. Many workplaces only employed women if they were single and forced women to resign when they got married. Paying women less than men for the same role was normal and there was no maternity leave, paid or unpaid.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment was also not illegal until 1984 and even then, only if it led to disadvantage in the workplace. It was only included in the Sex Discrimination Bill because of pressure from activists.</p>
<p>?The website will be a place where personal memories can become collective memories, where they can be shared, and preserved for history,? says Associate Professor Kaine,</p>
<p>The Australian Services Union, National Tertiary Education Union and United Voice have provided Initial seed funding to develop the website. The project is supported by the UTS Centre for Business and Social Innovation, which aims to examine issues around social access, equity and fairness at work.</p>

<p>With Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples representing 3 per cent of the population, the number should be closer to 500. But Indigenous architects make up just 0.2 per cent of the roughly 12,000 architects in Australia today.</p>
<p>This gap is the target of a new scholarship fund to support Indigenous architecture students like Marni Reti, now in her fourth year of architecture at UTS and the only Indigenous student in her class.</p>
<p>The Droga Indigenous Architecture Scholarship has been made possible with a $1 million donation from cultural philanthropists the Droga Family Foundation. With additional support from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the aim is to eventually support up to 10 Indigenous students a year in their studies with UTS?s <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-design-architecture-and-building/what-we-do/architecture">School of Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>The scholarship follows on from the Droga <a href="http://foundation.architecture.com.au/">Architect in Residence</a> program Daniel and Lyndell Droga launched in 2014 in partnership with the Australian Institute of Architecture, which has the aim of providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism and design.</p>
<p>?We wanted to build on the success of the residency and, in particular, understand Indigenous participation in architecture in Australia ? and these hard facts [on Indigenous representation] were revealed in our research,? says Daniel Droga.</p>
<p>?It?s clear there?s enormous scope for improvement,? Lyndell Droga says. ?We decided to team up with UTS, working in collaboration with their Jumbunna [Indigenous Education and Research] program to develop a comprehensive scholarship that supports students not only with tuition and accommodation expenses but with meaningful career development opportunities such as mentoring and internships.?</p>

<p>?We workshopped the concept with my brother David and his wife, Marisa, who were eager to become involved,? says Daniel Droga.</p>

[Droga5 is a New York-based, independent advertising network.]  </p>
<p>?We?re all thrilled to be involved in working towards meaningful change for Indigenous participation in Australian architecture,? Daniel Droga says.</p>
<p>The Drogas? donation is the largest single donation to the education of Indigenous architects in Australia.</p>
<p>The goal is to support up to six undergraduate and up to four postgraduate architecture scholarships each year. The awardees will also be mentored by the industry, with the Government Architect NSW and the NSW Architects Registration Board supporting the initiative as the first industry partners,</p>
<p>Professor Michael McDaniel, UTS?s Pro Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Leadership and Engagement, and Director of the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, says Indigenous architects have the potential to make a valuable contribution ?not only to their communities but to society as a whole, by bringing architectural skills and knowledge together with an understanding of culture, community and environment?.</p>
<p>UTS will support the Droga scholarships through Jumbunna, which includes the Galuwa Experience program introducing Indigenous high school students to a broad range of higher education opportunities, such as architecture.</p>
<p>UTS Professor of Architecture Anthony Burke says the perspective and knowledge of Indigenous architects is needed not just in Indigenous or remote communities but in urban spaces too.</p>
<p>?There?s an enormous, untapped wealth of Indigenous knowledge that has never made it across the threshold into architectural practice or environmental design,? he says. ?An Indigenous perspective on architecture is a real source of inspiration and a resource for us as a discipline.?</p>
<p>He hopes that by starting to build Indigenous representation in Australian architecture, yet more Indigenous people will be inspired to join the profession.</p>
<p>Student Marni Reti, who grew up on ?The Block? in Sydney?s Redfern, hopes to use her skills in her local community ? an urban environment where she wants to bring an Indigenous perspective and give local communities a voice.</p>
<p>Indigenous architects have a wealth of knowledge about country and land, and how to create a space that is specific to Australia, she says.</p>
<p>The Droga program aims to award the first two scholarships to commence in 2019.</p>

<p>Professor Michael McDaniel, UTS?s Pro Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Leadership and Engagement, and Director of the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, says Indigenous architects have the potential to make a valuable contribution ?not only to their communities but to society as a whole, by bringing architectural skills and knowledge together with an understanding of culture, community and environment?.</p>
<p>UTS will support the Droga scholarships through Jumbunna, which includes the Galuwa Experience program introducing Indigenous high school students to a broad range of higher education opportunities, such as architecture.</p>
<p>UTS Professor of Architecture Anthony Burke says the perspective and knowledge of Indigenous architects is needed not just in Indigenous or remote communities but in urban spaces too.</p>
<p>?There?s an enormous, untapped wealth of Indigenous knowledge that has never made it across the threshold into architectural practice or environmental design,? he says. ?An Indigenous perspective on architecture is a real source of inspiration and a resource for us as a discipline.?</p>
<p>He hopes that by starting to build Indigenous representation in Australian architecture, yet more Indigenous people will be inspired to join the profession.</p>
<p>Student Marni Reti, who grew up on ?The Block? in Sydney?s Redfern, hopes to use her skills in her local community ? an urban environment where she wants to bring an Indigenous perspective and give local communities a voice.</p>
<p>Indigenous architects have a wealth of knowledge about country and land, and how to create a space that is specific to Australia, she says.</p>
<p>The Droga program aims to award the first two scholarships to commence in 2019.</p>

Over 95 per cent of TB cases and deaths occur in developing countries.</p>
<p>Chancellors Postdoctoral Research Fellow (CPDRF) Dr Nilesh Bokil is no stranger to the damaging effects of TB. </p>
<p>Nilesh remembers the lingering effects TB had on his grandmother: "She wasn't able to fly, she wasn't able to go anywhere. Towards the end of her life, she was bed-ridden, and as winter rolled around, her condition would get worse."  </p>
<p>As a 2018 CPDRF, Nilesh is now embarking on a four-year research project to develop new microRNA-based therapeutic treatments against the inflammation caused by TB. </p>

<p>So, <a href="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2018/03/dna-rna-and-microrna">what are microRNA</a>? You'll be forgiven for missing the memo: "MicroRNA were only discovered in the 90s," explains Nilesh. ?When cells need to get something done, RNA ? which is a copy of the cell?s DNA ? is produced. This RNA is then translated to proteins for things to work.</p>
<p>?MicroRNA are small RNA molecules that don?t actually code for proteins but are involved in regulating the conversion of other RNA into protein. By doing so, they can regulate important cell functions including inflammation.</p>
<p>Because they were so recently discovered, the specific details of how they work, what they do, and what areas they target are up in the air. But, says Nilesh, ?We know they're important physiologically because when you get rid of some of them, it affects multiple body functions including the immune system." </p>
<p>Nilesh is focussing on the effects of these infinitesimally small molecules to help control the effects of TB, which can include extensive scarring of the lungs. He hopes to deliver real changes to those affected by TB. </p>
<p>He says, "The problem with TB and treatment in general, is that you have to take a minimum of six months? of antibiotics to get better.? But before and during treatment your lungs are inflamed and healthy tissue is being damaged.</p>
<p>"So you may be cured at the end of six months, and have no bacteria in the lungs, but you'll never get that damaged tissue back.</p>
<p>"I've dealt with people who have been cured but who are left with just 40 per cent lung capacity. And, in developing countries the majority of people who get TB are of working age ? imagine going back to work as a manual labourer, for example, with 40 per cent lung capacity. You can?t breathe, you have little energy, it?s debilitating." </p>
<div class="uts-bq">
<blockquote><p>If we are successful, it is going to have an effect on the social structure of communities, not just the medical sector</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>It?s situations like this, says Nilesh, that fostered his special interest in inflammatory and infectious diseases, and made him realise the urgent need for new therapies to treat them. Though his first stage of research is underway, Nilesh says he has at least four years in front of him trying to identify which microRNA will be most relevant and then develop potential therapeutics.</p>
<p>"We have samples of patients who are either healthy or who are suffering from the disease," explains Nilesh, "If we can identify which microRNA are altered, not only can we use that information for developing therapeutics, but we can also use that for the early diagnosis of TB.</p>
<p>"If we are successful, it is going to have an effect on the social structure of communities, not just the medical sector," says Nilesh.</p>
<p>"Most of the countries affected are in the developing world: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Nigeria. And a bigger problem associated with this is that HIV is also prevalent in these countries and people living with HIV are 20 to 30 times more susceptible to TB than people without HIV."  </p>
<p>Nilesh hopes to use his research as the starting point for identifying therapeutic applications of microRNA modulation for other inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and cirrhosis. </p>
<p>"This fellowship gives me the chance to not have to worry about publishing quotas and producing results on a yearly basis," he says. "I think that's important for getting early- and mid-career scientists to start thinking about long-term projects. Sometimes the most impactful publications or developments can be a culmination of four to five years' work, so this freedom is very valuable." </p>
<p>As a 2018 CPDRF, Nilesh will also be teaching and mentoring UTS students. He's is in a unique position to share his real-world perspective on the science they're learning. "I'm keen to teach into and develop courses at UTS that will give students an understanding of the translational effects of research that is done not only at UTS, but across Australia and around the world.?</p>

<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The #MeToo movement has generated much needed discussion about inappropriate sexual behaviour and what constitutes consent to any sexual encounter. Despite some backlash, there is a sense women have reached a new level of agitation that won?t settle. The groundswell of anger might be sufficient to sustain a deep dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</p>
<p>But such cultural revolutions require change at many levels, from the interpersonal to the institutional. Young people are important in this revolution ? many are leaders of the movement. Others need the knowledge and skills to recognise and interpret signals, and assert their own positions within the complex, often confusing situations that require sexual negotiation and consent.</p>

<hr /><p>These are learned informally from parents, carers, peers and the media. Formal school education is <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/148060/Sexual-Education-in-Australia-2011.pdf">widely accepted</a> as one of the appropriate institutions for teaching children and adolescents about relationships, sexual and reproductive health, and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Post-#MeToo, teachers who are already engaged in skills-building in the area of consent might explore its nuances. They might delve deeper into sexual harassment and what it looks and feels like. And help shift young people?s understanding that consent is not just about (mainly) girls saying ?no?, but also (mainly) boys understanding ?yes?.</p>
<h2>The importance of sexuality education</h2>
<p>This year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) published a <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf">revised version</a> of their 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education.</p>
<p>This report summarises decades of evidence of the positive impact comprehensive sexuality education has on measurable aspects of sexual behaviour. These include delaying commencement of sexual intercourse, reducing the number of partners and increasing use of contraception and condom use.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/good-sex-ed-doesnt-lead-to-teen-pregnancy-it-prevents-it-60036">Good sex ed doesn't lead to teen pregnancy, it prevents it</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Other desirable outcomes, such as less gender discrimination and gender-based violence, and healthy relationships, have been less rigorously studied. But these are also likely to be positively impacted by comprehensive sexuality education.</p>
<h2>Teaching consent</h2>
<p>In Australia, the principles of sexuality education are covered by the national <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/health-and-physical-education/?year=12993&amp;year=12994&amp;year=12995&amp;year=12996&amp;year=12997&amp;year=12998&amp;strand=Personal%2C+Social+and+Community+Health&amp;strand=Movement+and+Physical+Activity&amp;capability=ignore&amp;capability=Literacy&amp;capability=Numeracy&amp;capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&amp;capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&amp;capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&amp;capability=Ethical+Understanding&amp;capability=Intercultural+Understanding&amp;priority=ignore&amp;priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&amp;priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&amp;priority=Sustainability&amp;elaborations=true&amp;elaborations=false&amp;scotterms=false&amp;isFirstPageLoad=false">Health and Physical Education</a> curriculum. This includes a range of topics broadly classified as aspects of consent.</p>
<p>As early as kindergarten, the curriculum areas include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Understanding in what situations parts of the body should be kept private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognising one?s own emotions and learning how to express them, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able to name people you trust and places you feel safe.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As the curriculum progresses through primary and secondary school, these themes continue. Attention is paid to understanding the body as it develops, recognising emotion, exploring empathy and respectful relationships, particularly between peers.</p>
<p>During the mid-adolescent years, risk-taking behaviours and peer influences are a <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2014/201/10/health-emerging-adults-australia-freedom-risk-and-rites-passage">natural feature of development</a>. At this point, the curriculum articulates the need for students to learn ?practising skills to deal with challenging or unsafe situations? and ?asserting their stance on a situation, dilemma or decision ??</p>
<p><figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a> <figcaption><span class="caption">Young people are playing an important role in dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKw4eamvjKA">Photo by Nicole Adams on Unsplash</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>All states and territories will adopt or use the national curriculum as a basis to develop their own health and physical education syllabuses, where additional detail can be found. For example, in New South Wales, the <a href="http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/pdhpe/pdhpe-7-10">current syllabus for years seven to ten</a> (circa 2003) explicitly discusses teaching the role gender can play in a range of attitudes, behaviours and health outcomes.</p>
<p>Power in relationships is also specifically mentioned. So too is a detailed list of learning outcomes about communication, assertiveness and negotiation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/4ba7e0bb-b518-4868-976c-bd49fb802fd8/PDHPE+K-10+Draft+Syllabus+2017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=">new draft NSW syllabus</a> mentions the word consent in three places in years seven and eight, and years nine and ten. But this is done in the broad context of ethical relationships, not specifically sexual.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/introduction/rationale-and-aims">Victorian curriculum</a> (circa 2016) also articulates principles of respect and ethics in relationships and discusses power and gender. A search through the health curricula of other states and territories finds similar themes.</p>
<p>The average age of first intercourse among <a href="https://members.youthcoalition.net/sites/default/files/articles-external/National%20Survey%20of%20Australian%20Secondary%20Students%20and%20Sexual%20Health.pdf">Australian secondary students is 16 years</a>. But by this time, the majority have experienced some form of (non-penetrative) sexual activity. It?s reassuring that notions of consent appear in the early secondary years alongside learning about personal boundaries, recognising one?s own emotions, and communication skills.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/bringing-pleasure-into-the-discussion-about-sexting-among-teens-92425">Bringing pleasure into the discussion about sexting among teens</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Despite most sexually active secondary students reporting that they have had pleasurable sexual experiences (an important indicator of sexual health), a high proportion consistently report having had unwanted intercourse, with significant gender differences.

<p>Intoxication was a common reason (around 50%) for all students, but for females, pressure from a partner was the most common, at 61%. Being frightened was cited by 34%.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Six months after the explosive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">allegations of sexual harassment</a> against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light, giving impetus to the #MeToo movement, this series looks at the aftermath of the movement, and if it has brought about lasting change to sexual harassment and gender equality.</em></p>
<hr /><p class="uts-lead">The #MeToo movement has generated much needed discussion about inappropriate sexual behaviour and what constitutes consent to any sexual encounter. Despite some backlash, there is a sense women have reached a new level of agitation that won?t settle. The groundswell of anger might be sufficient to sustain a deep dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</p>
<p>But such cultural revolutions require change at many levels, from the interpersonal to the institutional. Young people are important in this revolution ? many are leaders of the movement. Others need the knowledge and skills to recognise and interpret signals, and assert their own positions within the complex, often confusing situations that require sexual negotiation and consent.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-is-not-enough-it-has-yet-to-shift-the-power-imbalances-that-would-bring-about-gender-equality-92108">#MeToo is not enough: it has yet to shift the power imbalances that would bring about gender equality</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>These are learned informally from parents, carers, peers and the media. Formal school education is <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/148060/Sexual-Education-in-Australia-2011.pdf">widely accepted</a> as one of the appropriate institutions for teaching children and adolescents about relationships, sexual and reproductive health, and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Post-#MeToo, teachers who are already engaged in skills-building in the area of consent might explore its nuances. They might delve deeper into sexual harassment and what it looks and feels like. And help shift young people?s understanding that consent is not just about (mainly) girls saying ?no?, but also (mainly) boys understanding ?yes?.</p>
<h2>The importance of sexuality education</h2>
<p>This year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) published a <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf">revised version</a> of their 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education.</p>
<p>This report summarises decades of evidence of the positive impact comprehensive sexuality education has on measurable aspects of sexual behaviour. These include delaying commencement of sexual intercourse, reducing the number of partners and increasing use of contraception and condom use.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/good-sex-ed-doesnt-lead-to-teen-pregnancy-it-prevents-it-60036">Good sex ed doesn't lead to teen pregnancy, it prevents it</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>Other desirable outcomes, such as less gender discrimination and gender-based violence, and healthy relationships, have been less rigorously studied. But these are also likely to be positively impacted by comprehensive sexuality education.</p>
<h2>Teaching consent</h2>
<p>In Australia, the principles of sexuality education are covered by the national <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/health-and-physical-education/?year=12993&amp;year=12994&amp;year=12995&amp;year=12996&amp;year=12997&amp;year=12998&amp;strand=Personal%2C+Social+and+Community+Health&amp;strand=Movement+and+Physical+Activity&amp;capability=ignore&amp;capability=Literacy&amp;capability=Numeracy&amp;capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&amp;capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&amp;capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&amp;capability=Ethical+Understanding&amp;capability=Intercultural+Understanding&amp;priority=ignore&amp;priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&amp;priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&amp;priority=Sustainability&amp;elaborations=true&amp;elaborations=false&amp;scotterms=false&amp;isFirstPageLoad=false">Health and Physical Education</a> curriculum. This includes a range of topics broadly classified as aspects of consent.</p>
<p>As early as kindergarten, the curriculum areas include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Understanding in what situations parts of the body should be kept private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognising one?s own emotions and learning how to express them, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able to name people you trust and places you feel safe.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As the curriculum progresses through primary and secondary school, these themes continue. Attention is paid to understanding the body as it develops, recognising emotion, exploring empathy and respectful relationships, particularly between peers.</p>
<p>During the mid-adolescent years, risk-taking behaviours and peer influences are a <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2014/201/10/health-emerging-adults-australia-freedom-risk-and-rites-passage">natural feature of development</a>. At this point, the curriculum articulates the need for students to learn ?practising skills to deal with challenging or unsafe situations? and ?asserting their stance on a situation, dilemma or decision ??</p>
<p><figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/211102/original/file-20180320-31614-1d5ik0x.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a> <figcaption><span class="caption">Young people are playing an important role in dismantling of systems of sexual discrimination against women.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKw4eamvjKA">Photo by Nicole Adams on Unsplash</a></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>All states and territories will adopt or use the national curriculum as a basis to develop their own health and physical education syllabuses, where additional detail can be found. For example, in New South Wales, the <a href="http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/pdhpe/pdhpe-7-10">current syllabus for years seven to ten</a> (circa 2003) explicitly discusses teaching the role gender can play in a range of attitudes, behaviours and health outcomes.</p>
<p>Power in relationships is also specifically mentioned. So too is a detailed list of learning outcomes about communication, assertiveness and negotiation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/4ba7e0bb-b518-4868-976c-bd49fb802fd8/PDHPE+K-10+Draft+Syllabus+2017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=">new draft NSW syllabus</a> mentions the word consent in three places in years seven and eight, and years nine and ten. But this is done in the broad context of ethical relationships, not specifically sexual.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/introduction/rationale-and-aims">Victorian curriculum</a> (circa 2016) also articulates principles of respect and ethics in relationships and discusses power and gender. A search through the health curricula of other states and territories finds similar themes.</p>
<p>The average age of first intercourse among <a href="https://members.youthcoalition.net/sites/default/files/articles-external/National%20Survey%20of%20Australian%20Secondary%20Students%20and%20Sexual%20Health.pdf">Australian secondary students is 16 years</a>. But by this time, the majority have experienced some form of (non-penetrative) sexual activity. It?s reassuring that notions of consent appear in the early secondary years alongside learning about personal boundaries, recognising one?s own emotions, and communication skills.</p>

It will test the government?s capacity to redress the ?systemic and shocking failures? the commission identified.</p>
<p>The detail of the government?s reforms remains elusive four months after the commission?s <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/Report.aspx#_Findings">final report</a> was handed down. However, the challenges to implementation and justice are clear.</p>
<p>In March, the government <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24304">affirmed its commitment</a> to ?generational change?, and announced <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">it will implement</a> all 227 recommendations. Its actions range from spending A$70 million to build new detention centres, diversion strategies (such as bail support and non-custodial sentencing programs), and the establishment of family service hubs.</p>
<p>The government reiterated the <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">promises it made</a> last November to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>close the Don Dale and Alice Springs youth detention centres;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide bail accommodation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have greater Aboriginal Community Controlled Sector involvement in family support.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>But will this approach create deep-seated change in youth justice?</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/don-dale-royal-commission-demands-sweeping-change-is-there-political-will-to-make-it-happen-86223">Don Dale royal commission demands sweeping change ? is there political will to make it happen?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><h2>Recommendations that fall short</h2>
<p>A key demand of advocates for youth justice reform has been to <a href="https://shutyouthprisonsmparntwe.wordpress.com/">shut down detention centres</a>. Their view is detention has failed children and damaged lives.</p>
<p>The commission identified this failure, but it fell short of recommending their closure. Instead, it proposed purpose-built detention centres. The government <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">has announced</a> it will build two new detention centres.</p>
<p>The recommendation to establish 20 family support centres is likely to reproduce old ways of managing Indigenous families without a clear imperative to reduce the removal of children from families.</p>
<p>Without increased resources being given to Indigenous families, communities and organisations to maintain the wellbeing of their children based on Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing, these centres will only replicate established institutional practices of managing children.</p>
<p>That there are only 20 centres means they will not provide place-based care across the hundreds of Indigenous communities and homelands in the NT.</p>
<p>The recommendation to consult and partner with Aboriginal Peak Organisations in developing an Aboriginal Out-of-Home Care Strategy may not give Indigenous communities a voice.</p>
<p>The commission heard that since <a href="https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/politics/northern-territory-emergency-response-intervention">the Intervention</a> in 2007, government consultation has become a dirty word in Indigenous communities. They <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2016/Transcript-12-October-2016.pdf">feel betrayed</a> by the Commonwealth government, which consults only after policies are decided.</p>
<p>Where Indigenous organisations spoke out against government policy, their organisations <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2017/Transcript-21-June-2017.pdf">were defunded</a>. The commitment that is needed therefore is not simply one of consultation, but empowerment.</p>
<p>The commission noted two officers displayed particularly egregious conduct, but did not recommend charges be laid against them or detention managers be held to account. This continues the lack of justice for the young people tortured in detention.</p>
<p>Matters that have gone before the courts paint a bleak picture.</p>
<p>In 2014, Alice Springs detention supervisor Derek Tasker was prosecuted in the NT Supreme Court for choking Dylan Voller and bashing his head against a cell wall. The footage of this incident showed 14-year-old Voller quietly sitting in his cell when Tasker grabbed him. The court found Tasker?s actions were reasonable and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-08/guard-involved-in-stripping-voller-to-front-royal-commission/8336788">he was acquitted</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, a civil case was brought by four of the six Indigenous boys who were gassed in Don Dale?s isolation unit in 2014. Despite all bar one having been sitting in their cell passively, the court found the gassing was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-21/don-dale-teenagers-gassed-win-civil-lawsuit-against-nt-govt/8373768">?reasonable and necessary?</a> and did not award compensation for this aspect of the claim.</p>
<h2>The NT government?s reticence</h2>
<p>Ninety-one of the commission?s recommendations have received <a href="http://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/nt-govt-to-accept-all-227-royal-commission-findings/news-story/426a74f396e98142527c9ddd9879d8c2">mere in-principle support</a>. This includes the controversial measure to increase criminal liability from ten to 12 years of age, and to keep kids under 14 out of detention centres.</p>
<p>This would make the NT the first Australian jurisdiction to lift the age of criminal responsibility from ten. While not substantially reducing the youth detention population, it would prevent the brutalisation of the youngest and most-vulnerable children.</p>
<p>The NT government has continuously referred to the need for the federal government to step up to its responsibility to care for children, especially <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">by matching</a> its initial $50 million funding commitment.</p>
<p>But youth justice and child protection are squarely in the domain of the states and territories. The federal government?s failure to act would be a weak basis for the NT government to disavow its responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Ideology gets in the way</h2>
<p>Policing of young people alongside a government mantra of ?tough on crime? have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-indigenous-kids-in-detention-in-the-nt-in-the-first-place-63257">major push factors</a> for Indigenous children becoming increasingly detained in the NT over the past decade.</p>
<p>This approach has continued unabated: the government unleashed the Territory Response Group police unit to monitor young people immediately after the royal commission concluded.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-indigenous-kids-in-detention-in-the-nt-in-the-first-place-63257">Why are so many Indigenous kids in detention in the NT in the first place?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>The NT government continues to refer to children in detention as <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24304">?problem youth?</a>, and its goal as creating <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">?safer communities?</a>. Such a persistent focus on children as a criminal risk subordinates a focus on children?s human rights.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">The worth of the <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx">royal commission</a> into the Northern Territory?s child detention system will be known only when the territory government goes about the task of implementing <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Documents/Royal-Commission-NT-Findings-and-Recomendations.pdf">its recommendations</a>. It will test the government?s capacity to redress the ?systemic and shocking failures? the commission identified.</p>
<p>The detail of the government?s reforms remains elusive four months after the commission?s <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/Report.aspx#_Findings">final report</a> was handed down. However, the challenges to implementation and justice are clear.</p>
<p>In March, the government <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24304">affirmed its commitment</a> to ?generational change?, and announced <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">it will implement</a> all 227 recommendations. Its actions range from spending A$70 million to build new detention centres, diversion strategies (such as bail support and non-custodial sentencing programs), and the establishment of family service hubs.</p>
<p>The government reiterated the <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">promises it made</a> last November to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>close the Don Dale and Alice Springs youth detention centres;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide bail accommodation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have greater Aboriginal Community Controlled Sector involvement in family support.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>But will this approach create deep-seated change in youth justice?</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/don-dale-royal-commission-demands-sweeping-change-is-there-political-will-to-make-it-happen-86223">Don Dale royal commission demands sweeping change ? is there political will to make it happen?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><h2>Recommendations that fall short</h2>
<p>A key demand of advocates for youth justice reform has been to <a href="https://shutyouthprisonsmparntwe.wordpress.com/">shut down detention centres</a>. Their view is detention has failed children and damaged lives.</p>
<p>The commission identified this failure, but it fell short of recommending their closure. Instead, it proposed purpose-built detention centres. The government <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">has announced</a> it will build two new detention centres.</p>
<p>The recommendation to establish 20 family support centres is likely to reproduce old ways of managing Indigenous families without a clear imperative to reduce the removal of children from families.</p>
<p>Without increased resources being given to Indigenous families, communities and organisations to maintain the wellbeing of their children based on Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing, these centres will only replicate established institutional practices of managing children.</p>
<p>That there are only 20 centres means they will not provide place-based care across the hundreds of Indigenous communities and homelands in the NT.</p>
<p>The recommendation to consult and partner with Aboriginal Peak Organisations in developing an Aboriginal Out-of-Home Care Strategy may not give Indigenous communities a voice.</p>
<p>The commission heard that since <a href="https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/politics/northern-territory-emergency-response-intervention">the Intervention</a> in 2007, government consultation has become a dirty word in Indigenous communities. They <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2016/Transcript-12-October-2016.pdf">feel betrayed</a> by the Commonwealth government, which consults only after policies are decided.</p>
<p>Where Indigenous organisations spoke out against government policy, their organisations <a href="https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/NT-public-hearings/Documents/transcripts-2017/Transcript-21-June-2017.pdf">were defunded</a>. The commitment that is needed therefore is not simply one of consultation, but empowerment.</p>
<p>The commission noted two officers displayed particularly egregious conduct, but did not recommend charges be laid against them or detention managers be held to account. This continues the lack of justice for the young people tortured in detention.</p>
<p>Matters that have gone before the courts paint a bleak picture.</p>
<p>In 2014, Alice Springs detention supervisor Derek Tasker was prosecuted in the NT Supreme Court for choking Dylan Voller and bashing his head against a cell wall. The footage of this incident showed 14-year-old Voller quietly sitting in his cell when Tasker grabbed him. The court found Tasker?s actions were reasonable and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-08/guard-involved-in-stripping-voller-to-front-royal-commission/8336788">he was acquitted</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, a civil case was brought by four of the six Indigenous boys who were gassed in Don Dale?s isolation unit in 2014. Despite all bar one having been sitting in their cell passively, the court found the gassing was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-21/don-dale-teenagers-gassed-win-civil-lawsuit-against-nt-govt/8373768">?reasonable and necessary?</a> and did not award compensation for this aspect of the claim.</p>
<h2>The NT government?s reticence</h2>
<p>Ninety-one of the commission?s recommendations have received <a href="http://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/nt-govt-to-accept-all-227-royal-commission-findings/news-story/426a74f396e98142527c9ddd9879d8c2">mere in-principle support</a>. This includes the controversial measure to increase criminal liability from ten to 12 years of age, and to keep kids under 14 out of detention centres.</p>
<p>This would make the NT the first Australian jurisdiction to lift the age of criminal responsibility from ten. While not substantially reducing the youth detention population, it would prevent the brutalisation of the youngest and most-vulnerable children.</p>
<p>The NT government has continuously referred to the need for the federal government to step up to its responsibility to care for children, especially <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/23952">by matching</a> its initial $50 million funding commitment.</p>
<p>But youth justice and child protection are squarely in the domain of the states and territories. The federal government?s failure to act would be a weak basis for the NT government to disavow its responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Ideology gets in the way</h2>
<p>Policing of young people alongside a government mantra of ?tough on crime? have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-indigenous-kids-in-detention-in-the-nt-in-the-first-place-63257">major push factors</a> for Indigenous children becoming increasingly detained in the NT over the past decade.</p>
<p>This approach has continued unabated: the government unleashed the Territory Response Group police unit to monitor young people immediately after the royal commission concluded.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-indigenous-kids-in-detention-in-the-nt-in-the-first-place-63257">Why are so many Indigenous kids in detention in the NT in the first place?</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>The NT government continues to refer to children in detention as <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24304">?problem youth?</a>, and its goal as creating <a href="http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24289">?safer communities?</a>. Such a persistent focus on children as a criminal risk subordinates a focus on children?s human rights.</p>
<p>Indigenous witnesses from remote communities who came before the commission spoke about the devastating effect the Intervention had on their capacity to care for their children.</p>
<p>These witnesses referred to the bureaucratisation of Indigenous services that had previously been community-run and its regime of discriminatory controls. They described the torture in Don Dale as an extension of the Intervention and requiring immediate repeal.</p>

<hr /><p class="uts-lead">When news of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?article-sidebar">allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein</a> broke last October, it unleashed a torrent of emotion, especially on social media, offering permission to disclose current and past experiences of sexual harassment and assault. In an unprecedented quantum of use, it offered many angry and upset women accessible ways of venting often long-repressed feelings. It also gave rise to <a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/metoo-45316">the #MeToo movement</a>.</p>
<p>The volume and breadth of the responses raise many serious questions about the presumed ?equality? gains of women. Over the past 70 years, after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Gray-t.html?pagewanted=all">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, <a href="https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ows/seminars/tcentury/FeminineMystique.pdf">Betty Friedan</a> and <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780007205011/">Germaine Greer</a> started debates that drove the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/second-wave-feminism/4983136">second-wave feminist movement</a>, we have achieved serious changes to our legal status, paid employment, and roles in public life.</p>
<p>However, the torrents of anger and complaints from #MeToo raise issues of whether gender powers have really been redefined, both locally and in most Western countries. Have we really made the essential cultural shifts that ensure women are no longer the ?second sex?, living in worlds devised, defined and controlled by men?</p>
<p>The intentions of the second wave covered more than making women equal to men (in their terms, as were then defined). We intended to create the changes that allowed women and men to redefine what matters, to ensure we were no longer seen as primarily sexual or reproductive objects.</p>
<p>The current debate is just further evidence we failed to make the necessary power shifts. And macho male resistance to women?s power may also be increasing.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/metoo-and-timesup-move-off-the-red-carpet-and-towards-activism-at-2018-oscars-92723">#MeToo and #TimesUp move off the red carpet and towards activism at 2018 Oscars</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>The evidence online and increasingly <a href="https://theconversation.com/hazing-and-sexual-violence-in-australian-universities-we-need-to-address-mens-cultures-92685">in reports and complaints</a>, plus the intransigent <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-rates-of-domestic-violence-in-australia-still-so-high-87187">domestic violence numbers</a>, suggest current gender power imbalances are creating far too many damaging and unequal male-female relationships. Too many men, including those in power, express their ego, insecurities, problems and frustrations by dominating, bullying, controlling, undermining and embarrassing women.</p>
<p>The public appetite for equitable social changes seems to be receding, replaced with deteriorating social and political trust alongside growing nostalgia and tribalism. So, there appears to be little hope for more progressive power shifts to create more gender fairness.</p>
<p>There has been some optimism that the volume of protests and outpourings would generate public movements for change. But, like most forms of protest, they offer evidence of problems but fail to tackle the broader causes and how to fix them.</p>
<p>Part of the ongoing problem is the lack of serious cultural change programs that shift structures. The emphasis is still on using the law to handle individual complaints via either conciliation or charges.</p>
<p>Conciliation, when it works, does not allocate blame and is usually confidential, so is not a change agent. If charges are laid, the process often damages the complainant, as they are questioned and often shamed, even if they win. Many lose, and the process really becomes a social change deterrent.</p>
<p>There are multiple recorded problems with the individualised complaints model, as those accused seek to crush or shame accusers. A prime recent example of this is the Barnaby Joyce case and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-26/barnaby-joyce-complaint-alleges-sexual-misconduct-lawyer-says/9483252">allegations of sexual harassment</a>. When this accusation came to light, the personal details of the female complainant were published, and her desire for confidentiality was ignored.</p>
<p>There are many other stories of how those who seek individual complaints are punished: lost jobs, character assassination, being labelled as ?difficult?, and so on.</p>
<p>While many of the reports are of serious crimes that need to be reported to police, others range from offensive and annoying to bad, crass, stupid behaviour. What they share are macho power assumptions and powerless feminised responses, all of which ensures they are inadequately tackled.</p>
<p><figure></figure></p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fN5HV79_8B8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="440"></iframe><p></p>
<p>Accusations of crimes create often expensive court cases that cause damage to a complainant even if she wins. So, formal justice may offer little relief.</p>
<p>Yes, the system does punish those convicted as perpetrators, but it deters few, as individualised measures do not affect most of the wider societal groups that misuse their macho power.</p>
<p>Legal processes, even if based on rights, do not really effect the serious social change to attitudes or power that real gender equity will require. We need to address the social mores and related power structures that reinforce male power and support toxic masculinity.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/hazing-and-sexual-violence-in-australian-universities-we-need-to-address-mens-cultures-92685">Hazing and sexual violence in Australian universities: we need to address men's cultures</a> </strong> </em></p>
<hr /><p>How can we use the current explosion of evidence and outrage to trigger the needed changes?</p>
<p>We are still in early days of the ?new? media as social change agents. Some positives: celebratory protests at award ceremonies and the wearing of supportive signs and colours have increased media coverage and the visibility of public support. There are discussions of increased resources for legal actions against perpetrators, and for more funding support to care for victims.</p>
<p>But these ?solutions? are similar to those being pursued in the many campaigns against domestic violence, helping survivors. While these responses are needed in the short term, we must realise that they will not drive the cultural and gendered power changes we need. If ?clicktivism? replaces wider political action and campaigns for change, we go backwards.</p>
<p>If we are serious about the abuse of gender-based power, we must look at its causes and make structural and cultural changes. We must overcome the serious, widespread gender-biased socialisation of boys and girls, in most cases long before they reach puberty.</p>
<p>Basic assumptions about gender roles still create beliefs about being an acceptable boy (stand up for yourself) or girl (be nice and read people?s feelings). These offer surefire paths to toxic masculinity and passive femininity.</p>
<p>These emerged in a recent BBC documentary, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/no-more-boys-and-girls-can-our-kids-go-gender-free/">broadcast on the ABC</a>. It showed seven-year-olds displaying very stereotypical views of preferring male over female when it came to confidence in skills and leadership. It also showed how removing school and home items that reinforced gender roles could reduce the different socialisations ? in other words, it?s not genetic.</p>
<p>Given all of that, my concern is that #MeToo and related expressions of anger are failing to fix causes that increase macho-driven gender power imbalances. This means we need real, practical solutions to bridge the gender divide and stop supporting toxic masculinity.</p>

<hr /><p class="uts-lead">When news of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?article-sidebar">allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein</a> broke last October, it unleashed a torrent of emotion, especially on social media, offering permission to disclose current and past experiences of sexual harassment and assault. In an unprecedented quantum of use, it offered many angry and upset women accessible ways of venting often long-repressed feelings. It also gave rise to <a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/metoo-45316">the #MeToo movement</a>.</p>
<p>The volume and breadth of the responses raise many serious questions about the presumed ?equality? gains of women. Over the past 70 years, after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Gray-t.html?pagewanted=all">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, <a href="https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ows/seminars/tcentury/FeminineMystique.pdf">Betty Friedan</a> and <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780007205011/">Germaine Greer</a> started debates that drove the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/second-wave-feminism/4983136">second-wave feminist movement</a>, we have achieved serious changes to our legal status, paid employment, and roles in public life.</p>
<p>However, the torrents of anger and complaints from #MeToo raise issues of whether gender powers have really been redefined, both locally and in most Western countries. Have we really made the essential cultural shifts that ensure women are no longer the ?second sex?, living in worlds devised, defined and controlled by men?</p>
<p>The intentions of the second wave covered more than making women equal to men (in their terms, as were then defined). We intended to create the changes that allowed women and men to redefine what matters, to ensure we were no longer seen as primarily sexual or reproductive objects.</p>
<p>The current debate is just further evidence we failed to make the necessary power shifts. And macho male resistance to women?s power may also be increasing.</p>

<hr /><p>The evidence online and increasingly <a href="https://theconversation.com/hazing-and-sexual-violence-in-australian-universities-we-need-to-address-mens-cultures-92685">in reports and complaints</a>, plus the intransigent <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-rates-of-domestic-violence-in-australia-still-so-high-87187">domestic violence numbers</a>, suggest current gender power imbalances are creating far too many damaging and unequal male-female relationships. Too many men, including those in power, express their ego, insecurities, problems and frustrations by dominating, bullying, controlling, undermining and embarrassing women.</p>
<p>The public appetite for equitable social changes seems to be receding, replaced with deteriorating social and political trust alongside growing nostalgia and tribalism. So, there appears to be little hope for more progressive power shifts to create more gender fairness.</p>
<p>There has been some optimism that the volume of protests and outpourings would generate public movements for change. But, like most forms of protest, they offer evidence of problems but fail to tackle the broader causes and how to fix them.</p>
<p>Part of the ongoing problem is the lack of serious cultural change programs that shift structures. The emphasis is still on using the law to handle individual complaints via either conciliation or charges.</p>
<p>Conciliation, when it works, does not allocate blame and is usually confidential, so is not a change agent. If charges are laid, the process often damages the complainant, as they are questioned and often shamed, even if they win. Many lose, and the process really becomes a social change deterrent.</p>
<p>There are multiple recorded problems with the individualised complaints model, as those accused seek to crush or shame accusers. A prime recent example of this is the Barnaby Joyce case and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-26/barnaby-joyce-complaint-alleges-sexual-misconduct-lawyer-says/9483252">allegations of sexual harassment</a>. When this accusation came to light, the personal details of the female complainant were published, and her desire for confidentiality was ignored.</p>
<p>There are many other stories of how those who seek individual complaints are punished: lost jobs, character assassination, being labelled as ?difficult?, and so on.</p>
<p>While many of the reports are of serious crimes that need to be reported to police, others range from offensive and annoying to bad, crass, stupid behaviour. What they share are macho power assumptions and powerless feminised responses, all of which ensures they are inadequately tackled.</p>
<p><figure></figure></p>

<p>Accusations of crimes create often expensive court cases that cause damage to a complainant even if she wins. So, formal justice may offer little relief.</p>
<p>Yes, the system does punish those convicted as perpetrators, but it deters few, as individualised measures do not affect most of the wider societal groups that misuse their macho power.</p>
<p>Legal processes, even if based on rights, do not really effect the serious social change to attitudes or power that real gender equity will require. We need to address the social mores and related power structures that reinforce male power and support toxic masculinity.</p>

<hr /><p>How can we use the current explosion of evidence and outrage to trigger the needed changes?</p>
<p>We are still in early days of the ?new? media as social change agents. Some positives: celebratory protests at award ceremonies and the wearing of supportive signs and colours have increased media coverage and the visibility of public support. There are discussions of increased resources for legal actions against perpetrators, and for more funding support to care for victims.</p>
<p>But these ?solutions? are similar to those being pursued in the many campaigns against domestic violence, helping survivors. While these responses are needed in the short term, we must realise that they will not drive the cultural and gendered power changes we need. If ?clicktivism? replaces wider political action and campaigns for change, we go backwards.</p>
<p>If we are serious about the abuse of gender-based power, we must look at its causes and make structural and cultural changes. We must overcome the serious, widespread gender-biased socialisation of boys and girls, in most cases long before they reach puberty.</p>
<p>Basic assumptions about gender roles still create beliefs about being an acceptable boy (stand up for yourself) or girl (be nice and read people?s feelings). These offer surefire paths to toxic masculinity and passive femininity.</p>
<p>These emerged in a recent BBC documentary, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/no-more-boys-and-girls-can-our-kids-go-gender-free/">broadcast on the ABC</a>. It showed seven-year-olds displaying very stereotypical views of preferring male over female when it came to confidence in skills and leadership. It also showed how removing school and home items that reinforced gender roles could reduce the different socialisations ? in other words, it?s not genetic.</p>
<p>Given all of that, my concern is that #MeToo and related expressions of anger are failing to fix causes that increase macho-driven gender power imbalances. This means we need real, practical solutions to bridge the gender divide and stop supporting toxic masculinity.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">To improve cities, governments are increasingly promoting the use of technology and data-driven decision-making. They decide how technologies and Big Data are being used or deployed in creating smart cities, with the help of academics who collect and interpret data, design new city ideas and newer technologies for cities.</p>
<p>Data harnessed from networked objects that citizens wear or use daily can ease our lives. But it?s possible that the uses of Big Data jeopardise citizens, such as in the scenarios we present below.</p>
<h2>1. Longer commute for low-class workers</h2>
<p>Imagine this: A traffic system manages a city?s rush hour, handling thousands of traffic lights, public transport commutes and pedestrian signals. Meanwhile, an AI system uses real-time data drawn from hundreds of thousands of sensors on vehicles and buses. With help from infrastructure like light poles, the optimal flow of traffic is calculated based on the number of vehicles and people in the system.</p>
<p>Reducing commute times and improving productivity is the stated end goal of city governments. Who could argue with that?</p>
<p>But linking traffic data, geographic data and economic performance creates another scenario. If the system increases economic performance, is it any wonder it prioritises higher-paying jobs linked to more expensive suburbs neighbouring the city?</p>
<p>Low-paid commuters contribute less financially to a city?s economy, so a highly paid executive getting a quicker ride to work makes brutal sense. But the system introduces a bias: public transport suddenly takes a little longer for a clerical worker.</p>
<h2>2. Park bench meter?</h2>
<p>The humble park bench presents another ethical dilemma for city planners. We?ve been paying for car parking in cities for decades. Now that we can live-track people in fine detail, the possibility of micro-charging for public amenities creates an opportunity for new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Think about paying a few cents for time spent resting on a park bench ? a parking meter for people. This obviously discourages the positive attributes of city living for avid park users.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/210705/original/file-20180316-104645-skvrol.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">In the future, will we have to pay to sit on a park bench?</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source"><a href="http://www.shutterstock.com">www.shutterstock.com</a></span></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yet, as an example of ?data-driven? governance, it plausibly shines a light on the already feasible potential for economic disparity.</p>
<h2>3. Health and the consent of citizens</h2>
<p>Big Data can also be used to inform city design and planning to reduce health disparities. Public surveillance systems can connect geo-data with health services data to attend to populations that need urgent help.</p>
<p>But there are major ethical challenges that centre on fears about the privacy of information that is provided. The perception that data will be paternally used in targeted community interventions is also an issue.</p>
<p>At the Indonesian-Australian Digital Forum in Jakarta in January, participants analysed the sustainability of using citizen reports to collect data on malaria. This information sharing can potentially benefit communities by targeting public health services in areas of need.</p>
<p>But it also creates stigma and privacy concerns when individuals are known within their community as disease carriers. Is there any opportunity to consider a person?s consent?</p>
<p>Big Data certainly creates opportunities to reduce health disparities. But how many benevolent government interventions engage targeted citizens in the development process?</p>
<h2>Focusing on the citizen</h2>
<p>The examples we use above are very near-term realities. The possibilities and problems of Big Data mean designers require a new type of intelligence that exists between technology and the humanities.</p>
<p>As technologies become more sophisticated the designer holds a key role in customising such concepts for mass use. Additionally, as the pendulum swings from technological solutions towards the citizen?s experiences, the variations in different countries? political and cultural systems will become more pronounced. The old adage that ?all politics is local? will be reinforced.</p>
<p>But in a Big Data environment, the tendency to average out all those local specificities is magnified by generic technology approaches to complex cultural and contextual problems.</p>
<p>Governments should think about and resolve ethical questions in the design of smart cities. City planners should ensure that the technologies deployed do not take away citizens? privacy and that personal data are not used against them.</p>

<p>Research from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) shows that plant communities in gullies are much more flammable than plant communities on ridge-tops.</p>
<p>Ecologist, and lead investigator of the study, <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/brad.murray">Dr Brad Murray</a> says that the results of the research into plant flammability are of serious concern, because ?all sorts of animals have normally used gullies as refuges during bushfires.?</p>
<p>How environmentally selected variation in leaf traits, such as leaf area (LA) and leaf mass per area (LMA), drives variation in leaf flammability at landscape scales has remained largely unknown until now. The study compares leaf traits and flammability characteristics between species of sheltered forest vegetation (low light, moist habitat) and plant species of exposed woodland vegetation (high light, dry habitat) in a fire-prone landscape of south-eastern Australia.<br />
 <br />
The researchers found that leaves of sheltered forest species were significantly more flammable due to both higher ignitibility and combustibility compared with exposed woodland species.</p>
<p>?These significant differences [in leaf ignitibility and combustibility] are reinforced by sheltered forest species having leaves with significantly larger LA and lower LMA compared with exposed woodland species,? says Daniel Krix, UTS School of Life Sciences PhD student and lead author of the study published in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2093/pdf">Ecosphere</a>.</p>
<p>Sheltered forest habitat tends to burn less frequently and less intensely than exposed woodland, however, projected changes to climate will allow wildfires to overcome the once protective nature of gully topography, the researchers say.</p>
<p>?Wildfire frequency and intensity is projected to increase which means that higher leaf flammability in sheltered forest species has the potential to exacerbate the effects of changing weather conditions to place sheltered forest habitat, their plants and their animals, at even higher risk of catastrophic wildfire,? Dr Murray says.</p>
<p>?If the gullies are becoming more at risk of going up in huge fires, then where will the animals go?? he says.</p>
