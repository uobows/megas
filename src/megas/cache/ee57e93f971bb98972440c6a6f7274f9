<p>UTS Business School Associate Professor Sarah Kaine and RMIT Professor Cathy Brigden have launched a <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/save-womens-stories">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money for an oral history project that will record these stories for posterity and inspire future generations.</p>
<p>?We realised there was an imbalance in the stories of people who battled to make things better in the workplace. The current recorded history focuses on men ? there is a lack of stories about women who fought for their rights and the rights of those around them,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to seek out 50 women who were activists between 1968 and the present, from a wide range of backgrounds, and record them in their own words via face-to-face interviews. The interviews will then be made available to the public via a web archive.</p>
<p>?There is something really powerful and inspiring about hearing people speak in their own words about their experiences ? hearing them tell stories of everyday bravery that has often come at a personal cost in terms of pressure on them and their families,? says Associate Professor Kaine. </p>
<p>The project will include interviews with senior union figures involved in major campaigns, people like former ACTU president Jennie George, but it will also include lesser-known women, ?everyday heroes? who have inspiring stories of challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>As well as asking for public support to fund the project, the researchers are looking for help in uncovering the women activists who helped shape their workplaces, whether in capital cities or regional areas, and from all cultures and backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of the women already interviewed is cleaner Chris Wagland, a union leader and activist for the rights of workers in the cleaning industry. Wagland has worked as a cleaner for more than 30 years, and became involved in activism when her workplace refused to pay long-service leave and other worker entitlements.</p>
<p>?The biggest barrier is always to get people to take that big leap into the unknown, to put their hands up? that?s the power that people don?t realise they have. No matter how much your voice wavers, or you get upset or your knees shake,? says Wagland.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/235320342">Wagland?s story</a> about how she stepped up and held her ground, despite threats and bullying, is the kind of story the researchers are looking for ? one that will help others realise that change is possible. </p>
<p>The stories will include issues from the late 60s to current times ? from harassment or underpayment, to the gender pay gap, maternity leave, issues with contract work, or continually being a casual or contingent worker.</p>
<p>?We chose 1968 because it was a pivotal time in terms of politics and the women?s movement, and it will enable us to investigate both broader social change, and change across the union movement. This is a living history project, so we will also include current stories,? says Associate Professor Kaine.</p>
<p>In 1968 workplace conditions for women were very different from today. Many workplaces only employed women if they were single and forced women to resign when they got married. Paying women less than men for the same role was normal and there was no maternity leave, paid or unpaid.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment was also not illegal until 1984 and even then, only if it led to disadvantage in the workplace. It was only included in the Sex Discrimination Bill because of pressure from activists.</p>
<p>?The website will be a place where personal memories can become collective memories, where they can be shared, and preserved for history,? says Associate Professor Kaine,</p>
<p>The Australian Services Union, National Tertiary Education Union and United Voice have provided Initial seed funding to develop the website. The project is supported by the UTS Centre for Business and Social Innovation, which aims to examine issues around social access, equity and fairness at work.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">As the 2018 NRL season kicks off, few of the game?s supporters will be aware it is enjoying a run of competitive balance unequalled anywhere in major world sport.</p>
<p>By the time of the Grand Final at the end of September, it will be more than 25 years since a team last retained the NRL crown (or that of its NSWRL/ARL predecessors).</p>
<p>You have to cast your mind back to the heady days of the Brisbane Broncos in 1993, and <a href="https://youtu.be/TagzL11fWoc?t=1h51m22s">their Tina Turner-fuelled celebrations</a>, to find the last back-to-back premiers. The subsequent run of 24 seasons without a repeat champion is not just unprecedented for top-level rugby league in Australia ? it?s unparalleled in any major sporting competition anywhere in the world.</p>
<h2>The cap fits</h2>
<p>Since its introduction in 1990, the NRL?s salary cap has not been without its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Bulldogs_RLFC_season">controversy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Storm_salary_cap_breach">scandal</a> or <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/titans-henry-says-salary-cap-not-working">criticism</a>. Many detractors argue it isn?t working and is failing to <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/roosters-roster-proves-the-nrl-salary-cap-isnt-working-and-its-time-to-consider-how-it-can-change/news-story/08a1f2ccb469acdc63208f3acdef71ba">distribute the league?s talent evenly</a>.</p>
<p>Some cite the seeming inevitability of seeing Melbourne Storm captain Cameron Smith?s face <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-02/nrl-title-caps-off-superb-era-of-melbourne-storm-success:-boland/9008176">on Grand Final day</a>. Others will quote the common joke that some teams seem to be operating more under a <a href="http://thecumberlandthrow.com/2017/10/31/hola-amigos-roosters-salary-sombrero-saves-nrl/">salary sombrero than a cap</a>, such is the amount they are able to squeeze under it.</p>
<p>However, the simple fact is the numbers show that no major sporting competition in the world has enjoyed such a long run of diverse champions.</p>
<p>It wasn?t always this way. In the last years before the salary cap?s introduction, between 1980 and 1990, Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown won four premierships each and Canberra secured a couple. Just one other side got a look-in during those 11 years.</p>
<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>
<p>Imagine a competition with <em>N</em> teams that compete each year, with one side declared premiers. If, each year, all teams were equally likely to win the title, then ? on average ? you?d expect to wait about <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricDistribution.html"><em>N minus one</em> years</a> to see back-to-back premierships.</p>
<p>Repeat successes would be less common in larger competitions.</p>
<p>In reality, for a more realistic competition, you?d expect repeat champions to come around more frequently than under this assumption.</p>
<p>Common sense suggests a team good enough to be premiers one year will have a better-than-average chance of repeating their success. This is the pattern seen in all sporting leagues across the world.</p>
<h2>A global anomaly</h2>
<p>Examining results from 26 elite competitions across 12 different sports, involving teams from five continents, the NRL?s run of competitive balance stands out as an exception to the global trend.</p>
<p>I calculated the current run without a back-to-back champion for each competition. Different competitions have different numbers of teams, so this needs to be taken into account for any like-for-like comparison.</p>
<p>Under the very conservative assumption of equal strength teams, the odds of such a repeat title drought occurring can be calculated according to the equation below, where <em>d</em> is the number of years since the last repeat champion in a league with <em>N</em> teams.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/208783/original/file-20180304-65507-1y4rp9o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Equation to calculate a repeat title drought.</span> </figcaption></figure></p>

<h2>A historic run</h2>
<p>It isn?t simply that the NRL?s current run stands out among trends from other contemporary leagues. Dusting off the history books, none of these other competitions has ever seen a drought of back-to-back titles quite like the modern NRL.</p>
<p>Of the leagues included here, the NRL is one of only three that has ever had a drought of back-to-back premiers stretching for more years than there are teams in the competition.</p>
<p>The other two ? the Women?s National Basketball Association (WNBA) in the US and the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship ? are both much younger competitions. The Rugby Championship has only been a three- or four-team competition, and the WNBA is riddled with instability and many defunct teams. Of the well-established leagues, the NRL stands alone.</p>
<p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="EEgkl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EEgkl/4/" style="border: none" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<h2>An apology to Broncos fans</h2>
<p>There are probably some keen Queenslanders disputing that the NRL?s drought is quite as long as claimed here. In 1997, the Broncos were one of the clubs that broke away from the NRL and played in the rival Super League competition.</p>
<p>After winning that competition during its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Super_League_(Australia)_season">one and only season</a>, Brisbane then rejoined and claimed the 1998 NRL crown.</p>
<p>Even if you include the triumph in a rival competition followed by NRL success as a back-to-back title, the run of 19 years and counting still stands as statistically anomalous.</p>
<h2>True to its roots</h2>
<p>Statistically speaking, there is no major sporting competition in the world that has enjoyed such a run without crowning back-to-back champions.</p>
<p>For all its critics, it is difficult to believe the salary cap hasn?t worked better than in many other leagues at promoting competitive balance and parity.</p>
<p>In many ways, this seems fitting for the game?s history. Rugby league is, after all, a game born <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/08/why-rugby-league-still-patronised-mud-splattered-parochial-throwback">out of a staunch egalitarian</a> rebellion more than a century ago.</p>

Many detractors argue it isn?t working and is failing to <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/roosters-roster-proves-the-nrl-salary-cap-isnt-working-and-its-time-to-consider-how-it-can-change/news-story/08a1f2ccb469acdc63208f3acdef71ba">distribute the league?s talent evenly</a>.</p>
<p>Some cite the seeming inevitability of seeing Melbourne Storm captain Cameron Smith?s face <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-02/nrl-title-caps-off-superb-era-of-melbourne-storm-success:-boland/9008176">on Grand Final day</a>. Others will quote the common joke that some teams seem to be operating more under a <a href="http://thecumberlandthrow.com/2017/10/31/hola-amigos-roosters-salary-sombrero-saves-nrl/">salary sombrero than a cap</a>, such is the amount they are able to squeeze under it.</p>
<p>However, the simple fact is the numbers show that no major sporting competition in the world has enjoyed such a long run of diverse champions.</p>
<p>It wasn?t always this way. In the last years before the salary cap?s introduction, between 1980 and 1990, Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown won four premierships each and Canberra secured a couple. Just one other side got a look-in during those 11 years.</p>
<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>
<p>Imagine a competition with <em>N</em> teams that compete each year, with one side declared premiers. If, each year, all teams were equally likely to win the title, then ? on average ? you?d expect to wait about <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricDistribution.html"><em>N minus one</em> years</a> to see back-to-back premierships.</p>
<p>Repeat successes would be less common in larger competitions.</p>
<p>In reality, for a more realistic competition, you?d expect repeat champions to come around more frequently than under this assumption.</p>
<p>Common sense suggests a team good enough to be premiers one year will have a better-than-average chance of repeating their success. This is the pattern seen in all sporting leagues across the world.</p>
<h2>A global anomaly</h2>
<p>Examining results from 26 elite competitions across 12 different sports, involving teams from five continents, the NRL?s run of competitive balance stands out as an exception to the global trend.</p>
<p>I calculated the current run without a back-to-back champion for each competition. Different competitions have different numbers of teams, so this needs to be taken into account for any like-for-like comparison.</p>
<p>Under the very conservative assumption of equal strength teams, the odds of such a repeat title drought occurring can be calculated according to the equation below, where <em>d</em> is the number of years since the last repeat champion in a league with <em>N</em> teams.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/208783/original/file-20180304-65507-1y4rp9o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Equation to calculate a repeat title drought.</span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="qukI4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qukI4/4/" style="border: none" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<h2>A historic run</h2>
<p>It isn?t simply that the NRL?s current run stands out among trends from other contemporary leagues. Dusting off the history books, none of these other competitions has ever seen a drought of back-to-back titles quite like the modern NRL.</p>
<p>Of the leagues included here, the NRL is one of only three that has ever had a drought of back-to-back premiers stretching for more years than there are teams in the competition.</p>
<p>The other two ? the Women?s National Basketball Association (WNBA) in the US and the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship ? are both much younger competitions. The Rugby Championship has only been a three- or four-team competition, and the WNBA is riddled with instability and many defunct teams. Of the well-established leagues, the NRL stands alone.</p>
<p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="EEgkl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EEgkl/4/" style="border: none" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<h2>An apology to Broncos fans</h2>
<p>There are probably some keen Queenslanders disputing that the NRL?s drought is quite as long as claimed here. In 1997, the Broncos were one of the clubs that broke away from the NRL and played in the rival Super League competition.</p>
<p>After winning that competition during its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Super_League_(Australia)_season">one and only season</a>, Brisbane then rejoined and claimed the 1998 NRL crown.</p>
<p>Even if you include the triumph in a rival competition followed by NRL success as a back-to-back title, the run of 19 years and counting still stands as statistically anomalous.</p>
<h2>True to its roots</h2>
<p>Statistically speaking, there is no major sporting competition in the world that has enjoyed such a run without crowning back-to-back champions.</p>
<p>For all its critics, it is difficult to believe the salary cap hasn?t worked better than in many other leagues at promoting competitive balance and parity.</p>
<p>In many ways, this seems fitting for the game?s history. Rugby league is, after all, a game born <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/08/why-rugby-league-still-patronised-mud-splattered-parochial-throwback">out of a staunch egalitarian</a> rebellion more than a century ago.</p>

<p class="uts-lead">International Women?s Day is our chance to celebrate the achievements of women. The 2018 theme Press for Progress encourages us to discuss ways we can continue to push for gender equity. We spoke with some inspiring staff and students from across UTS ? including senior leaders, academics, students and start-up founders ? for their career insights and advice.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1BSSjJEoQQ" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Best thing you've ever done for your career? </strong></p>
<p>"A continued investment in my education. I'm a firm believer in lifelong education."<br /><em>Lan Snell, Director, Education Services for UTS Business School </em></p>
<p>"Taking calculated risks. Whenever I feel like I'm getting too comfortable in a job, let's say, I know how to do it, then it seems like it's time to move on."<br /><em>Margaret Petty, Executive Director, Innovation and Entrepreneurship - </em>Check out Margaret's latest <a href="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2018/03/empowering-women-through-entrepreneurship">Opinion</a> piece from U magazine about empowering women through entrepreneurship</p>
<p>"Learn the value of being involved in networks and collaborating. To have a wide group of people helping me and advising me of where I should go, and to make sure there were lots of ideas coming in."<br /><em>Professor Elizabeth Sullivan, Deputy DVC (Research), Director of the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/">Athena Swan</a> project </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Define a great leader.</strong></p>
<p>"A great leader has intellectual curiosity, and is willing to listen to, and learn from other people. If you're too much of an autocrat - it's my way or the highway - you're not a great leader."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>
<p>"Someone who puts their team first, that celebrates victories collectively, and that, when it falls apart, they take accountability and credit for that failure."<br /><em>Margaret Petty, Executive Director, Innovation and Entrepreneurship </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Best advice you've been given by a mentor that?s helped shape your career?</strong></p>
<p>"One of the best pieces of advice I got when I first became an academic was, "Everyone here, Lan, is smart - the difference is how kind you are."<br /><em>Lan Snell, Director, Education Services for UTS Business School </em></p>
<p>"Surround yourself with really good people, and then get out of their way!"<br /><em>Liz Brett, Chief Executive Officer, ActivateUTS</em></p>
<p>"Rather than just focusing on climbing the ladder, actually think about what are you doing to help people, or what are you doing that's still giving you intellectual curiosity."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to be remembered for? </strong></p>
<p>"Making a positive difference, and hopefully leaving the world in better shape than how I found it."<br /><em>Danielle McCartney, Manager, Sustainability, UTS Project Management Office</em></p>
<p>"For enabling and inspiring others to reach their full potential."<br /><em>Margaret Petty, Executive Director, Innovation and Entrepreneurship </em></p>
<p>"As someone who, in a little way, contributed to improving disadvantaged women?s lives."<br /><em>Professor Elizabeth Sullivan, Deputy DVC (Research), Director of the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/">Athena Swan</a> project </em></p>
<p>"Being part of the team that really transformed learning at UTS."<br /><em>Professor Shirley Alexander,  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education &amp; Students)   </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does resilience mean to you? </strong></p>
<p>"Resilience means Indigenous women, it means culturally diverse women, it means working class women, it means women who keep doing what they're doing without fanfare and without fuss. It means women who just keep the world going round."<br /><em>Professor Nareen Young, Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education &amp; Research </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What have you learnt from failure?</strong></p>
<p>"I work in start-up land, and failure is a part of every single day, and not in the sense that you're failing, but in the sense that every time you try something new, there's a chance it won't work. If you embrace that, and go out there and take that risk, you can learn from the times that things don't work, how you continue to do things better."<br /><em>Nicola Hazell, Director, <a href="https://www.shestarts.com/">SheStarts</a> </em></p>
<p>"There?s a saying that if you want to increase your success rate you have to be prepared to double your failure rate. And that?s what I?ve learned from failure."<br /><em>Professor Shirley Alexander,  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education &amp; Students)   </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Have you encountered the glass ceiling?  If so, how did you overcome it? </strong></p>
<p>"Yes, absolutely. It took me a long time to work out that there isn?t just one glass ceiling. There are multiple glass ceilings, and some are easier to shatter than others."<br /><em>Professor Elizabeth Sullivan, Deputy DVC (Research), Director of the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/">Athena Swan</a> project </em></p>
<p>"I think all women at some point in their career encounter the glass ceiling. I think the way to overcome it is to have good friendships with other women."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>
<p>"In the start-up space, I look at the coded ceiling, this idea that if you don't code, you can't be a tech start-up founder. At SheStarts we're challenging that very premise, to show that amazing women with great ideas can smash through that ceiling and build companies that are going to change the world."<br /><em>Nicola Hazell, Director, <a href="https://www.shestarts.com/">SheStarts</a> </em></p>
<p>"I have. Just keep tapping away, use a sledgehammer if you need to. Be persistent, and if we all keep doing it, it will shatter."<br /><em>Danielle McCartney, Manager, Sustainability, UTS Project Management Office</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we as a UTS community 'press for progress' around gender equity? </strong></p>
<p>"I really love Women @ UTS. I've been to a few of their events and I've made connections there. I think when we work collectively as women together, we can make change."<br /><em>Jenna Price, Senior Lecturer, UTS Journalism    </em></p>
<p>"We're inspiring female entrepreneurship by providing tools to women and allowing them to create their own jobs and create the jobs of the future. In our Hatchery Accelerate program, we have approximately 57% female founders."<br /><em>Margaret Petty, Executive Director, Innovation and Entrepreneurship </em></p>
<p>"We need to be thinking about gender and equality in every decision we make and every appointment we make."<br /><em>Professor Shirley Alexander,  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education &amp; Students)   </em></p>
<p>"There are really easy things that faculties can do, such as regular audits in the kinds of people employed and at what level. So that we can have full information about whether things like the glass ceiling are still affecting us"<br /><em>Christina Ho, Senior Lecturer, Social and Political Sciences</em></p>
<p>"Support and promote more safe spaces for women and femme-identifying students"<br /><em>Bernice Datu, Women's Convenor, UTS Women's Collective</em></p>
<p>"Continue to support difference among women. Constantly recognising intersectionality and cultural diversity and Indigeneity among women...and keep doing what we're doing."<br /><em>Professor Nareen Young, Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education &amp; Research </em></p>
<p>"Knowing your place in the communities you?re trying to help. And knowing when to lead the charge and when to stand back and help other people raise their voices. The <a href="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2016/05/respect-now-always">Respect.Now.Always</a> campaign is already pressing for progress - it's open to not just women but also to gender-diverse backgrounds."<br /><em>Aadarsh Prasad, student</em></p>
<p>"It is inconceivable that in a just and ethical society, women have any less opportunity in employment or in life. For real progress, it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to continue and consistently strive for positive change. The Athena SWAN, our unconscious bias training, our recruitment commitments - these are all parts of a bigger program aimed at driving concrete change here at UTS."<br /><em>Professor Attila Brungs, Vice-Chancellor and President</em></p>
<p>"Get involved. Find people of a like mind and get involved. You have the agency to change the world, and you have the people who want to help you do it, so get involved."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The stats</strong></p>
<ul><li>Women make up 46.9% of the employed Australian workforce </li>
<li>They hold 13.7% of chair positions, 24.9% of directorships, and comprise 16.5% of CEOs </li>
<li>Compared to their male counterparts, women make 15.3% less full-time income ? equating to an average of $253.70 less in their pocket each week </li>
</ul><p>For the 16th year in a row, UTS has been awarded the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/news/uts-recognised-gender-equality-workplace/">Employer of Choice</a> citation for Gender Equality by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). One of only 16 universities and 120 organisations to make the list, the citation is a leading practice program that aims to encourage, recognise and promote active commitment to achieving gender equality in Australian workplaces. </p>

<p>"There?s a saying that if you want to increase your success rate you have to be prepared to double your failure rate. And that?s what I?ve learned from failure."<br /><em>Professor Shirley Alexander,  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education &amp; Students)   </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Have you encountered the glass ceiling?  If so, how did you overcome it? </strong></p>
<p>"Yes, absolutely. It took me a long time to work out that there isn?t just one glass ceiling. There are multiple glass ceilings, and some are easier to shatter than others."<br /><em>Professor Elizabeth Sullivan, Deputy DVC (Research), Director of the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/">Athena Swan</a> project </em></p>
<p>"I think all women at some point in their career encounter the glass ceiling. I think the way to overcome it is to have good friendships with other women."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>
<p>"In the start-up space, I look at the coded ceiling, this idea that if you don't code, you can't be a tech start-up founder. At SheStarts we're challenging that very premise, to show that amazing women with great ideas can smash through that ceiling and build companies that are going to change the world."<br /><em>Nicola Hazell, Director, <a href="https://www.shestarts.com/">SheStarts</a> </em></p>
<p>"I have. Just keep tapping away, use a sledgehammer if you need to. Be persistent, and if we all keep doing it, it will shatter."<br /><em>Danielle McCartney, Manager, Sustainability, UTS Project Management Office</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we as a UTS community 'press for progress' around gender equity? </strong></p>
<p>"I really love Women @ UTS. I've been to a few of their events and I've made connections there. I think when we work collectively as women together, we can make change."<br /><em>Jenna Price, Senior Lecturer, UTS Journalism    </em></p>
<p>"We're inspiring female entrepreneurship by providing tools to women and allowing them to create their own jobs and create the jobs of the future. In our Hatchery Accelerate program, we have approximately 57% female founders."<br /><em>Margaret Petty, Executive Director, Innovation and Entrepreneurship </em></p>
<p>"We need to be thinking about gender and equality in every decision we make and every appointment we make."<br /><em>Professor Shirley Alexander,  Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education &amp; Students)   </em></p>
<p>"There are really easy things that faculties can do, such as regular audits in the kinds of people employed and at what level. So that we can have full information about whether things like the glass ceiling are still affecting us"<br /><em>Christina Ho, Senior Lecturer, Social and Political Sciences</em></p>
<p>"Support and promote more safe spaces for women and femme-identifying students"<br /><em>Bernice Datu, Women's Convenor, UTS Women's Collective</em></p>
<p>"Continue to support difference among women. Constantly recognising intersectionality and cultural diversity and Indigeneity among women...and keep doing what we're doing."<br /><em>Professor Nareen Young, Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education &amp; Research </em></p>
<p>"Knowing your place in the communities you?re trying to help. And knowing when to lead the charge and when to stand back and help other people raise their voices. The <a href="http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2016/05/respect-now-always">Respect.Now.Always</a> campaign is already pressing for progress - it's open to not just women but also to gender-diverse backgrounds."<br /><em>Aadarsh Prasad, student</em></p>
<p>"It is inconceivable that in a just and ethical society, women have any less opportunity in employment or in life. For real progress, it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to continue and consistently strive for positive change. The Athena SWAN, our unconscious bias training, our recruitment commitments - these are all parts of a bigger program aimed at driving concrete change here at UTS."<br /><em>Professor Attila Brungs, Vice-Chancellor and President</em></p>
<p>"Get involved. Find people of a like mind and get involved. You have the agency to change the world, and you have the people who want to help you do it, so get involved."<br /><em>Verity Firth, Executive Director, Social Justice</em></p>

<p><strong>The stats</strong></p>
<ul><li>Women make up 46.9% of the employed Australian workforce </li>
<li>They hold 13.7% of chair positions, 24.9% of directorships, and comprise 16.5% of CEOs </li>
<li>Compared to their male counterparts, women make 15.3% less full-time income ? equating to an average of $253.70 less in their pocket each week </li>
</ul><p>For the 16th year in a row, UTS has been awarded the <a href="https://equalfutures.uts.edu.au/news/uts-recognised-gender-equality-workplace/">Employer of Choice</a> citation for Gender Equality by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). One of only 16 universities and 120 organisations to make the list, the citation is a leading practice program that aims to encourage, recognise and promote active commitment to achieving gender equality in Australian workplaces. </p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Movie demand provides a handy barometer for the economy, and a pointer to the types of business that do well in a downturn, according to new research examining the world?s largest film industry, Bollywood.</p>
<p>When times are tough, people seek out escapist entertainment and are more likely to flock to cinemas for action movies and rom-coms, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Dr Ping Xiao from UTS Business School and Assistant Professor Anirban Mukherjee from Singapore Management University looked at three years of movie attendance in India, and compared this with economic indicators such as consumer sentiment, stock prices and the gold price.</p>
<p>?While you might think that movie demand would go down during bad economic times because people are tightening their belts, we found the opposite happens. When people are feeling stressed or miserable, the desire to escape and immerse themselves in a movie increases,? says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>?Our research shows movie demand increases when the economy is not doing well, and that particular types of movies ? those that have escapist features such as action movies, comedies and romantic movies ? are those most in demand.?</p>
<p>The study included 348 movies across 382 multiplexes, and covered the period before and after the election of Narendra Modi, which revealed that during times of political uncertainty there was an increase in movie demand and a decrease in consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>?Why we think it is escapism and not some other motive driving movie attendance is that demand did not go up for all movies, but only movies that have escapist features such as action movies, comedies and romantic movies,? says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>The analysis supports the findings of previous research from the US showing box-office receipts rose in six of the last seven recessions.</p>
<p>The link between movie demand and the economy has implications not only for the movie business but also for other industries that offer an escape from reality through immersive ?experiential consumption?, says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>?Immersive festivals such as Coachella and Burning Man, fitness events such as The Colour Run or Tough Mudder, along with cruise ship holidays and, in Australia, attendance at football and other sporting events, are likely to experience increased demand when economic times are tough,? she says.</p>
<p>Indian film director Manmohan Desai has famously said: ?I want people to forget their misery. I want to take them into a dream world where there is no poverty, where there are no beggars, where fate is kind and god is busy looking after his flock.?</p>
<p>Tapping into this desire might just be the key to success for businesses looking to profit from the next economic downturn or negative consumer sentiment survey.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p class="uts-lead">Movie demand provides a handy barometer for the economy, and a pointer to the types of business that do well in a downturn, according to new research examining the world?s largest film industry, Bollywood.</p>
<p>When times are tough, people seek out escapist entertainment and are more likely to flock to cinemas for action movies and rom-coms, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Dr Ping Xiao from UTS Business School and Assistant Professor Anirban Mukherjee from Singapore Management University looked at three years of movie attendance in India, and compared this with economic indicators such as consumer sentiment, stock prices and the gold price.</p>
<p>?While you might think that movie demand would go down during bad economic times because people are tightening their belts, we found the opposite happens. When people are feeling stressed or miserable, the desire to escape and immerse themselves in a movie increases,? says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>?Our research shows movie demand increases when the economy is not doing well, and that particular types of movies ? those that have escapist features such as action movies, comedies and romantic movies ? are those most in demand.?</p>
<p>The study included 348 movies across 382 multiplexes, and covered the period before and after the election of Narendra Modi, which revealed that during times of political uncertainty there was an increase in movie demand and a decrease in consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>?Why we think it is escapism and not some other motive driving movie attendance is that demand did not go up for all movies, but only movies that have escapist features such as action movies, comedies and romantic movies,? says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>The analysis supports the findings of previous research from the US showing box-office receipts rose in six of the last seven recessions.</p>
<p>The link between movie demand and the economy has implications not only for the movie business but also for other industries that offer an escape from reality through immersive ?experiential consumption?, says Dr Xiao.</p>
<p>?Immersive festivals such as Coachella and Burning Man, fitness events such as The Colour Run or Tough Mudder, along with cruise ship holidays and, in Australia, attendance at football and other sporting events, are likely to experience increased demand when economic times are tough,? she says.</p>
<p>Indian film director Manmohan Desai has famously said: ?I want people to forget their misery. I want to take them into a dream world where there is no poverty, where there are no beggars, where fate is kind and god is busy looking after his flock.?</p>
<p>Tapping into this desire might just be the key to success for businesses looking to profit from the next economic downturn or negative consumer sentiment survey.</p>

<hr /><p>Kate Scardifileld?s current exhibition <a href="http://art.uts.edu.au/index.php/exhibitions/soft-topologies/">Soft Topologies</a> at the UTS Gallery is an example of an artist using the metaphor of topology to make artwork and describe her practice. Scardifield?s primary media are textiles, though the exhibition is also a series of ?adaptable sculptures? that will be transformed by the artist and a select, multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>The exhibition is a choreography of Scardifield?s attractively coloured textiles, which spray, flutter, fan, drape, hang and crumple through the space like escaped gestures. These forms are only one version of the installations, limited by the static state convenient for gallery viewing.</p>
<p>The far wall of the exhibition is covered by a grid of yellow tape against bright blue. It?s a comparatively rigid expression of space that offsets the dynamism and intricacy of the textiles scattered about the room.</p>
<h2>What is topology?</h2>
<p>The origins of topology are in the field of geometry, where it is used to understand ?<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-nobel-prize-for-physics-goes-to-topology-and-mathematicians-applaud-66532">geometric objects that don?t change when bent or stretched</a>.?</p>
<p>Combined with algebraic geometry, abstract algebra, differential equations and probabilities, topology is now used in many branches of physics to understand ?<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-nobel-prize-for-physics-goes-to-topology-and-mathematicians-applaud-66532">exotic states of matter</a>? - that is, states of matter that are not solid, liquid or gas and that have <a href="https://www.school-for-champions.com/science/matter_states_exotic.htm#.WpTm1BNuY6g">very unusual physical characteristics</a>.</p>
<p>But topology has recently made the transition from an exclusively mathematical field of study to something that is more widely used in the analysis and creation of cultural and social phenomena. Some scholars even claim that culture as a whole is ?<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276412454552">becoming topological</a>.?</p>

<p>Scardifield?s exhibition is an example of the way practitioners from different disciplines productively use ideas that originate in vastly different fields of study.</p>
<p>Metaphors forged in one discipline happily circulate through others. ?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory">The cell</a>?, for instance, is an architectural term that became common and influential in biological science, the study of social phenomena (terrorist cells) and technology (cell phone). ?Immunity? is a term that originally had <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ifAczQoHyZ0C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=1881+immune+metaphor+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjoxjJOi1X&amp;sig=6yOxSYMeeY22-Fv6Xw5rtKnN_kc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMyO7-q8fZAhVEvrwKHbXOC9oQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1881%20immune%20metaphor%20law&amp;f=false">legal applications</a> meaning ?exception from liability?, which is now more commonly associated with medicine.</p>

<h2>Explaining relationships</h2>
<p>Topology enables a different understanding of the relationships between things.</p>
<p>Philosopher <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/390243">Ian Hacking</a> suggests that the topological metaphor of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a> is an improvement on the optical metaphor of a spectrum for capturing our present awareness of autism. A spectrum ?misleadingly suggests a single dimension from severe to high-functioning? whereas manifolds, like kinds of autism, ?come in any number of dimensions?.</p>
<p>Topological metaphors are also useful for thinking differently about other relations that are conventionally conceived as spectra: left and right political, male and female gender.</p>
<p>For example, thinking topologically enables the understanding that Greens supporters and Nationals, who are usually imagined to be at opposed ends of the political spectrum, might be aligned on certain issues, such as those to do with the fights against coal mines on farm land.</p>

Accordion pleated spinnaker cloth, sail battens.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Robin Hearfield</span>, <span class="license">Author provided</span></span> </figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Topology in textiles</h2>
<p>Scardifield?s practice involves folding and distorting cloth so that it takes on a surprising variety of forms. She focuses on the relationship between change and continuity of form through operations of weaving, folding, draping, pleating and layering. These are analogous to the abstract manipulations and speculations that inform the mathematical field of topology.</p>
<p>A flat piece of cloth is a classic, simple two dimensional space. Three dimensional space of a more complicated nature is created when Scardifield deliberately folds cloth in pleats.</p>
<p>Folds of a more random variety are created in the exhibition by allowing the cloth to describe the forms of other objects (draping) or the forces of gravity and tension (hanging). The new forms created in these processes are at once distinct from and yet continuous with the original pieces of cloth.</p>
<p><figure class="align-center "><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/207989/original/file-20180227-36706-qzfdfm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /><figcaption><span class="caption">Hand pleated and heat-set polyester organza, cotton thread, black tourmaline. 185x120cm (full expansion).

<p>Author and academic <a href="http://www.stevenconnor.com/topologies/">Steven Connor suggests</a> that ?the labile, intermediary form of the textile? provides a better material metaphor for understanding ?the contemporary world of communication and information? than previous alternatives of solidity or fluidity.</p>
<p>Textiles are at once pliable and cohesive, and in this sense invite the imagining of forms that dance with subtle fluctuations over time. This is expressed in the following video of Scardifield making a chevron mould.</p>
<script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script><script>
<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--

</script><p>The expression of space and form in terms of continuity and change is central to the individual objects in Soft Topologies and the overall design of the exhibition. Scardifield has deliberately designed the exhibition as a dynamic space, involving multiple participants from different disciplines who rearrange her works for the duration of the show and express her textiles through other media, such as video and photography.</p>
<p>The traces of her work in different media are like the traces left by the folds Scardifield makes in cloth and paper to create new forms.</p>
<p>Scardifield doesn?t use topological mathematics in her exhibition. However, the show is a great example of topology can invite different possibilities for imagining and analysis.</p>

<h2>Safety risks</h2>
<p>Emergency departments across Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia saw almost 500 injures from indoor trampoline parks between 2012 and 2016. And that?s an underestimate; our research used data from the state?s injury surveillance databases, missing those treated in private hospitals or by their GP.</p>
<p>Dislocations, sprains and strains were most common, followed by fractures. Some 15% of children presenting to hospital were admitted due the serious nature of their injuries.</p>
<p>More than half of all injuries were in children aged 10 to 14 years, with girls just as likely to be injured as boys.</p>

<p>The biggest problem was when multiple users were on one trampoline, attempting to do somersaults or flips, or landing awkwardly.</p>
<p>Another key problem is when users jump into the foam landing pit, which is not mandated to ensure sufficient depth, padding and impact reduction. It would be possible to land on a concrete block on your head, for example.</p>
<p>Trampoline park operators ask entrants to sign a <a href="http://www.flipoutsa.com.au/pdf/Flipout%20Waiver%20Document%202017.pdf">risk warning and waiver</a>, accepting the ?risk of personal injury and death?, prior to entry.

<hr /><p>This trend has been also seen internationally, where a previously fit and healthy 30-year-old man attempted a flip and landed awkwardly in a foam pit. The pit was only half the recommended depth, and the injury <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/maureen-kerley-pushes-for-trampoline-park-regulations-following-2012-death-of-son-at-phoenixs-skypark-6663641">cost the man his life</a>.</p>
<h2>We need mandatory standards</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurs have cashed in on the rapid growth of trampoline park venues across Australia, with one <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/entrepreneur/trampoline-fad-launchpad-for-32m-business-20150119-12t51f.html">generating</a> A$32 million of revenue in the first two years.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is currently <a href="https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/international-trampoline-parks-conference-raises-bar-for-industry/">no Australian standard</a> for indoor trampoline parks ? voluntary or mandatory. That means anyone can set up a profitable park by importing cheap trampolines, squeezing as many as they can into a facility, and scrimping on daily safety checks and maintenance.</p>
<p>Regulators have drafted a voluntary set of safety standards ? minimum safety thresholds ? to reduce the risk of serious traumatic injuries at indoor trampoline parks. These are currently under review, pending publication later this year. But these are voluntary; park operators can choose to follow them or not.</p>
<p>Australian standards for indoor trampoline parks would ensure operators are consistently setting up and running safe and well-maintained venues. Recommendations to <a href="https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/trampoline-association-to-undertake-facilities-safety-check">make these venues safer</a> include:</p>
<ul><li>ensuring that surrounding landing surfaces have adequate, appropriately placed protective padding in good condition</li>
<li>ensuing that damaged or worn equipment is replaced</li>
<li>improving the safety of those who jump into foam pits, by specifying a minimum pit depth and using thick foam blocks on concrete floors to absorb the shock or, preferably, a second trampoline</li>
<li>including a ?failsafe? mechanism such as nets beneath trampoline mats, or second trampolines</li>
<li>daily pre-opening maintenance and safety checks with appropriate governance.</li>
</ul><p>Until park operators are mandated to adhere to safety standards, patrons have limited legal recourse in cases where trampoline parks do not comply.</p>

<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>Well, you can use your own or a friend?s outdoor trampoline. While there are, of course, risks for children jumping on backyard trampolines, <a href="https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/PreviewDoc.aspx?saleItemID=2825165">Australian standards</a> apply to the import, enclosure systems, structural integrity, and entrapment risks to protect children falling off or being injured on elevated trampolines. The ACCC provides a <a href="http://www.productsafety.gov.au/trampolinesafety">good safety checklist</a> for choosing a backyard trampoline.</p>
<p>If you are going to send your kids to an indoor trampoline park, opt for one with <a href="http://www.atpa.org.au/accredited-members/">Australian Trampoline Park Association accreditation</a>. This is a <a href="http://www.atpa.org.au/new-member-info">code of practice</a> to which ATPA members must adhere, and which covers around one-third of parks. While we wait for mandatory regulation, indoor trampoline park users can vote with their feet and choose to jump at centres that take safety seriously.</p>

<p>The biggest problem was when multiple users were on one trampoline, attempting to do somersaults or flips, or landing awkwardly.</p>
<p>Another key problem is when users jump into the foam landing pit, which is not mandated to ensure sufficient depth, padding and impact reduction. It would be possible to land on a concrete block on your head, for example.</p>
<p>Trampoline park operators ask entrants to sign a <a href="http://www.flipoutsa.com.au/pdf/Flipout%20Waiver%20Document%202017.pdf">risk warning and waiver</a>, accepting the ?risk of personal injury and death?, prior to entry. While this risk might be low, in rare cases users have sustained permanent and <a href="http://www.kidspot.com.au/parenting/real-life/in-the-news/customers-sue-trampoline-franchise-flip-out-after-devastating-injuries/news-story/a55485b521e051177b7bfed97a4a5ad0">lifelong disability</a>.

<hr /><p>This trend has been also seen internationally, where a previously fit and healthy 30-year-old man attempted a flip and landed awkwardly in a foam pit. The pit was only half the recommended depth, and the injury <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/maureen-kerley-pushes-for-trampoline-park-regulations-following-2012-death-of-son-at-phoenixs-skypark-6663641">cost the man his life</a>.</p>
<h2>We need mandatory standards</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurs have cashed in on the rapid growth of trampoline park venues across Australia, with one <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/entrepreneur/trampoline-fad-launchpad-for-32m-business-20150119-12t51f.html">generating</a> A$32 million of revenue in the first two years.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is currently <a href="https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/international-trampoline-parks-conference-raises-bar-for-industry/">no Australian standard</a> for indoor trampoline parks ? voluntary or mandatory. That means anyone can set up a profitable park by importing cheap trampolines, squeezing as many as they can into a facility, and scrimping on daily safety checks and maintenance.</p>
<p>Regulators have drafted a voluntary set of safety standards ? minimum safety thresholds ? to reduce the risk of serious traumatic injuries at indoor trampoline parks. These are currently under review, pending publication later this year. But these are voluntary; park operators can choose to follow them or not.</p>
<p>Australian standards for indoor trampoline parks would ensure operators are consistently setting up and running safe and well-maintained venues. Recommendations to <a href="https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/trampoline-association-to-undertake-facilities-safety-check">make these venues safer</a> include:</p>
<ul><li>ensuring that surrounding landing surfaces have adequate, appropriately placed protective padding in good condition</li>
<li>ensuing that damaged or worn equipment is replaced</li>
<li>improving the safety of those who jump into foam pits, by specifying a minimum pit depth and using thick foam blocks on concrete floors to absorb the shock or, preferably, a second trampoline</li>
<li>including a ?failsafe? mechanism such as nets beneath trampoline mats, or second trampolines</li>
<li>daily pre-opening maintenance and safety checks with appropriate governance.</li>
</ul><p>Until park operators are mandated to adhere to safety standards, patrons have limited legal recourse in cases where trampoline parks do not comply.</p>

<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>Well, you can use your own or a friend?s outdoor trampoline. While there are, of course, risks for children jumping on backyard trampolines, <a href="https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/PreviewDoc.aspx?saleItemID=2825165">Australian standards</a> apply to the import, enclosure systems, structural integrity, and entrapment risks to protect children falling off or being injured on elevated trampolines. The ACCC provides a <a href="http://www.productsafety.gov.au/trampolinesafety">good safety checklist</a> for choosing a backyard trampoline.</p>
<p>If you are going to send your kids to an indoor trampoline park, opt for one with <a href="http://www.atpa.org.au/accredited-members/">Australian Trampoline Park Association accreditation</a>. This is a <a href="http://www.atpa.org.au/new-member-info">code of practice</a> to which ATPA members must adhere, and which covers around one-third of parks. While we wait for mandatory regulation, indoor trampoline park users can vote with their feet and choose to jump at centres that take safety seriously.</p>
