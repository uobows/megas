As you walk through the other part of Mai Kai there's an indoor waterfall with statues and rocks lining the sidewalk.

The room has a lot of great ways to set it up and you can even have uplights surrounding the room to illuminate the walls.

It's very convenient from the Palm Beaches as well as Ft Lauderdale and Miami. The best part is there's no actual gate to the main clubhouse so you can drive right up to the building.

It's a gorgeous ocean view on Ocean Blvd and Atlantic Ave. You can't get any closer to the beach than this. As you pull into the hotel there's Valet available with an overhang covering so you won't encounter any weather problems while dropping off your guests.

It has a modern and classy feel to it, great for impressing your guests. It's great for both parties and weddings. As you head to the back of the lobby to the very right the banquet rooms are on the north end. The main ballroom can hold hundreds of guests, so no matter the size of your event it can easily have 250-300 guests comfortably. We performed a corporate event with a stage at the back of the room and a double buffet on both sides of the room. There's a large wooden dance floor in the very center of the room and can accommodate a nice size group. We managed to have the entire dance floor full for quite a bit with about 75-100 people out there at a time.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwJG05WUY3Y/Ur_QVTqdokI/AAAAAAAACac/RYJT4w-rZAs/s1600/CAM00368.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwJG05WUY3Y/Ur_QVTqdokI/AAAAAAAACac/RYJT4w-rZAs/s320/CAM00368.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The staff at the Delray Beach Marriott were friendly and easy to work with.

It's a gorgeous ocean view on Ocean Blvd and Atlantic Ave. You can't get any closer to the beach than this.

The setting was River Cottages in Jensen Beach Florida. We were helping run the audio for the ceremony and perform the MC and DJ duties for the reception. Our ceremony system was setup over on the lawn area facing the inter-coastal waterway. We had a small bridal party with 3 groomsman and 3 bridesmaids. The cute little flower girls set the entrance of the bride as they came down the aisle.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After about a 10 minutes ceremony the guests headed over to the reception area underneath the large canopy for cocktails and drinks. The bridal party and family stayed over by the lawn for group photos. We had background music playing with a nice mixture of tropical beachy style music to accommodate the guests and set the mood. We were setup with a fantastic view behind us of the inter-coastal waterway and a long dock right out to the water. Definitely a great place for some pictures. The long open bar to the left side of the DJ booth and the guest tables setup to the right of us. We had a large open dance floor right in front for our guests to dance, bride &amp; groom to do their first dance and much more.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Our bride gave us some selections of music to play for the DJ along with some of our own ideas so we incorporated many of those songs for dinner and the up tempo music for the dancing crowd. The groomsman came out to say a few words to the bride and groom along with some of the other guests who came up to toast to the married couple as well. We then followed the toasts with the cake cutting right on the dance floor.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Later on in the evening as the sun went down we lowered the lights and turned on the DJ lights with moving colors to get the guests in the mood for some fun dance music. We played everything from the 70s,80s and 90s to some current music from the 2000s. We had guests dancing to some of the classic hip hop hits from the 90s and some 70s and 80s rock and roll.

Now that everyone is getting back to school and the fall is near, we are gearing up for new places to have events and new experiences with venues all around south Florida. As we expand our services north and south we are trying to go into more places in Miami, west coast of Florida such as Ft Myers &amp; Cape Coral plus Vero Beach and even Central Florida.

It's right near the PBIA Palm Beach International airport. The Knights of Columbus 7025 caters to a number of different event types. We had the pleasure of providing music for a Quinceanera. It has very easy access to the building for guests and party vendors. You can go right in the main entrance with equipment and party props or come in the back way as well. The knights of Columbus 7025 features 2 rooms, one room with a bar area and one large open room for a wedding reception, party, sweet 16, sweet 15 and more. You can easily fit over 100 people in the main room and have spare space for a photo booth or other cool vendor.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1cBtr5SOHVc/UhLoI0k4otI/AAAAAAAAA6A/mUYf7ga037I/s1600/CAM00197.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1cBtr5SOHVc/UhLoI0k4otI/AAAAAAAAA6A/mUYf7ga037I/s320/CAM00197.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a nice size dance floor right in the center of the room and you could have your head table and guest tables surrounding the dance floor.

If you're looking for that destination wedding feel and relaxing beach setting, this place is definitely worth looking into. You can't get any closer to some of the nicest beaches around. Right across the street is a full view of the ocean and then on the west side of the hotel is a great view of the inter-coastal waterway (the best of both worlds). As you drive up to the main entrance of the hotel there is valet parking to assist you in parking your vehicle.

The Westin has numerous rooms to cater to all your guests needs from wedding receptions to birthdays to corporate events they have the space and versatility to work with any event type.&nbsp; </span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--Itf-dw0Aao/Ub9ru4YugNI/AAAAAAAAAqg/-3tBfk7WzdY/s1600/CAM00578.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--Itf-dw0Aao/Ub9ru4YugNI/AAAAAAAAAqg/-3tBfk7WzdY/s320/CAM00578.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> We had the opportunity to perform in one of the smaller Las Olas rooms. It has a fantastic view overlooking the ocean side. This room is on the 2nd floor and is an L shaped setup allowing for a buffet style dinner or lunch on one end of the room and the dance floor with guest tables on the other. The setup of the room was great to accommodate a good 75 guests with room to roam. The main doors for the bridal party to walk in through were right next to the DJ booth making it very convenient to run everything smoothly. You can also have your cocktail hour on the sky-view 4th floor, which is a great open area overlooking almost the entire area. Our company always appreciates working with super friendly, easy-going staff at hotels and country clubs. The catering service there was exceptional in helping us coordinate everything and make sure the reception flowed nicely. They were very accommodating and helpful throughout the entire event. So we would definitely recommend if you're looking for a venue in this area to look into the Westin Ft Lauderdale Beach Florida. For those of you performing music whether you're a DJ or musician there's easy access to the rooms by elevator. You will probably need an assistant or additional person to help in carrying the equipment to the room.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's our overall evaluation on the Westin hotel Ft Lauderdale Beach Florida. We give it a 9.8 out of 10! That is an excellent score and we really enjoyed working at this venue. The staff there was wonderful, the views were amazing and the rooms were gorgeous with the modern style tropical feel. The only thing that we found a little difficult as a performer is the all Valet service. But guests may find that to be very convenient. And the walk to the room is a little of a trek so make sure you get there early and bring extra help.

If you're looking for that destination wedding feel and relaxing beach setting, this place is definitely worth looking into. You can't get any closer to some of the nicest beaches around. Right across the street is a full view of the ocean and then on the west side of the hotel is a great view of the inter-coastal waterway (the best of both worlds). As you drive up to the main entrance of the hotel there is valet parking to assist you in parking your vehicle.

This is a fairly formal venue and is nice for much larger events.</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://poloniaopen.com/admin/Files/Images/fcc_g2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="112" src="http://poloniaopen.com/admin/Files/Images/fcc_g2.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Fountains Country Club has a nice open layout with large entry way and hallway. The facility has valet parking for your convenience and a large overhang drive up area so you can drop off your guests. The Fountains has automatic doors that open at the front which is super convenient for anyone with a wheelchair or anyone bringing equipment or party props in. As you walk into the building to the right of the hall are the restrooms. These are some of the nicest restrooms I've seen in my career. Plenty of space for getting dressed and the layout is really nice for those of you having a ceremony and reception in one place. We had a chance to perform in their large ballroom to the east side of the building. There is a smaller room attached to the large banquet room for ceremonies and down the steps is the banquet room. There was a photo booth setup in the smaller room.&nbsp;</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The large banquet room is capable of holding 100-150 guests very comfortably, possibly even more. A dance floor can be setup right in the center of the room and a buffet can be setup to the far end and a large back wall area with windows can have just about anything you would like. They have a full staff for serving food either sit down dinner or buffet, depending on your preference. The staff seemed very friendly and accommodating and accessing the rooms is fairly easy as well. The only catch with setting up in the large banquet room was the steps down into the room. We didn't see a ramp to take stuff down but there maybe one and we missed it. The performer or DJ can setup right on the back wall facing the crowd and dance floor. There's plenty of room for a cocktail hour in the main hallway foyer, ceremony in the smaller room and reception the large. You won't feel cramped in this facility as it's nice and open.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the overall review of the Fountains Country Club in Lake Worth Florida. We give it a 9 out of 10 which is a great score! It's just in between the turnpike and I-95 for those who are traveling and need an easy right off the exit event. The facility is extremely elegant and can accommodate a large number of people. The staff was pleasant and easy to work with. We didn't get to try the food but from what our client told us it was good. You can find out if you go to an event or have one there. The only thing that was a little bit of a task was getting into the room down the steps. Other than that the Fountains country club is definitely worth looking into. For anyone in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, Wellington, Boynton Delray and Boca area.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you know anymore information or have anything you want to comment on feel free to add it here.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Billman </span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.discjockeyflorida.com/">DJ Lake Worth Florida</a>";s:4:"link";s:80:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-fountains-country-club-lake-worth.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:4665:"<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a nice venue that we finally had a chance to write about.

The Royal Palm Beach Cultural Center is a catering hall and special event facility out west of the Palm Beach area in the Royal Palm Wellington area. It's conveniently located on the main road and close to the airport for those of you having guests fly in from other places. The building is simple enough for a small birthday but large enough for a large corporate event or school dance.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Royal Palm Beach Cultural Center has a nice roundabout driveway that takes you right to the main door. It's so easy to bring in food, party props, equipment and anything else you need. The main door takes you into the full size extra large party room that has a stage for performances and lots of room for seating, tables and a dance area. This is quite a large room capable of holding 150-200 people fairly comfortably. Your entertainment, band or DJ can setup right on the main stage. There is a nice area on a higher up level in the Auditorium where you can setup a bar and buffet area. We have seen&nbsp; numerous types of events in this room, Sweet 16s, weddings, school events, Quinces, birthdays and many other events. They've also had Mariachi bands, DJs, karaoke &amp; more.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now the room we had a pleasure of playing in this time is the smaller party room down the hall of the facility. As you walk in the main doors you turn to the right and walk down around the hallway to the other party room. This room has 2 doors on each side of the room for easy access bringing equipment in. It also has a side ramp with doors on the side of the building with a driveway. It's so easy to bring your equipment and party props in. The smaller room can hold about 50-60 people comfortably with some space for an open dance floor, bar and buffet. We've performed at many birthdays, sweet 16s and parties in this room. It's super affordable too. It's a long rectangle shaped room and has lighting controls to set the room lights lower or higher. We would like to suggest that this room is nice with a set of uplighting effects. For uplighting see our blog on uplighting or visit djbillman.com and it tells you what they are. They're nice to give your room the color of your choice.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w0WlXvLmApM/UYcQX3KXMjI/AAAAAAAAAeg/MOV-QMF1ng0/s1600/CAM00109.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w0WlXvLmApM/UYcQX3KXMjI/AAAAAAAAAeg/MOV-QMF1ng0/s320/CAM00109.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the final thoughts and info on Royal Palm Beach Cultural Center &amp; Civic Center. The staff was very nice and has an office right next to the party rooms If you are a resident of the area you receive a discount. The cost is about $400 for the smaller room and about 500-700 for the larger room. We will give this facility a 9 out of 10. It's a great place for most size events and any type events. It's affordable to rent for the evening. The entire building has easy access and it has parking around the building. You have options for the size event. The staff was courteous and friendly when we arrived there. The only thing you will have to do is hire out your catering and bartender service. The larger room has a kitchen area to prepare food and store it. And finally it's about 15-20 minutes west of I95 on Okeechobee which is in a great area.

They're nice to give your room the color of your choice.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w0WlXvLmApM/UYcQX3KXMjI/AAAAAAAAAeg/MOV-QMF1ng0/s1600/CAM00109.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w0WlXvLmApM/UYcQX3KXMjI/AAAAAAAAAeg/MOV-QMF1ng0/s320/CAM00109.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the final thoughts and info on Royal Palm Beach Cultural Center &amp; Civic Center. The staff was very nice and has an office right next to the party rooms If you are a resident of the area you receive a discount. The cost is about $400 for the smaller room and about 500-700 for the larger room. We will give this facility a 9 out of 10. It's a great place for most size events and any type events. It's affordable to rent for the evening. The entire building has easy access and it has parking around the building. You have options for the size event. The staff was courteous and friendly when we arrived there. The only thing you will have to do is hire out your catering and bartender service. The larger room has a kitchen area to prepare food and store it. And finally it's about 15-20 minutes west of I95 on Okeechobee which is in a great area. Happy Venue hunting.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.fladiscjockeys.com/">Wedding DJ Delray Beach</a>&nbsp;</span>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1367805960;}i:14;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8503570578338910358.post-2209458252246917829";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 06:29:00 +0000";s:5:"title";s:71:"Elks Lodge 2166 Boca Raton Florida Wedding and Party Venue Banquet Hall";s:11:"description";s:4421:"<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On to our next venue and we've had the opportunity to work at various new facilities.

This is a simpler venue for those of you looking for a medium size place to have your party or wedding and want something affordable and easy to access. The Elks Lodge 2166 in Boca Raton Florida is a block north of Glades Road right on Federal Highway. It's a small building with 2 parking lots, one on the front and one on the back. The lounge &amp; bar of the facility is up front at the main entrance and through the back of the facility is the banquet hall.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dXdf1m3mF24/UXy9xajxvJI/AAAAAAAAAbg/JtWiv1T1uaE/s1600/13+-+1" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dXdf1m3mF24/UXy9xajxvJI/AAAAAAAAAbg/JtWiv1T1uaE/s320/13+-+1" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you first walk in to your left it goes straight in to the dance floor area. Pictured is a head table for a bridal party and to the right are the additional guest tables. Comfortably this banquet hall holds about 50-60 people and may be able to accommodate more if needed. The dance floor is pretty decent size and can handle your entire guest count. There's a small stage where the musician or DJ can setup directly behind the stage. Right next to the stage are doors to the back parking lot and a small loading ramp to bring in equipment, party favors, caterers, etc.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There's a full size kitchen on the left of the picture for the caterers and a bar area with counter farther down on the left. Talk about super convenient, this room has everything setup well. The stage area is capable of having a pretty good size setup too. I believe they have someone who can prepare the food but you may also be able to bring in your own caterer. There's 2 doors to come in and out on the right side of the picture above. For the entertainment getting in and out is super convenient. Loading and unloading is within 10 feet so setup is a breeze.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; And (Drum Roll please............) my review of the Elks Lodge 2166 in Boca Raton. I give this wedding &amp; party venue a 9.5 out of 10. That's a great review! As I came into the facility the staff was very friendly and greeted me as I came in. Getting in and out of the place was excellent. The dance floor is a great size for your guests and you could easily have some colored uplighting to enhance the room ambiance. The only minor thing about this facility is the size of the room. If you have a party of over 75 people it might be more difficult to fit everyone in the room. There's a kitchen and a bar setup right in the room. You really can't beat the convenience of this venue. So checkout the Elks Lodge 2166 in Boca Raton Florida for your next party, wedding or special event!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Leave your questions comments or anything else here and I'll be happy to respond.&nbsp; </span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">- Billman</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.billmanphoto.com/">South Florida Photographer</a></div>";s:4:"link";s:77:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/04/elks-lodge-2166-boca-raton-florida.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:4421:"<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On to our next venue and we've had the opportunity to work at various new facilities.

The Mara-largo club in Palm Beach is Donald Trumps very own Florida home and country club on the island of Palm Beach.

It's centrally based across a bridge on the east side of West Palm Beach just miles from I-95. This can help with your travelers by car and it's within 10 minutes of the PBI airport.

For those of you brides and grooms or anniversary party goers that are looking for amazing service and a king &amp; queen atmosphere this is definitely an idea to check into. There is a valet at the very front as you pull into the main building to help escort you and park you vehicle. It has a nice size overhang so that your guests can stay covered from any weather. We were setup in the ballroom to the back of the second building. You have to pull around the parking lot to the very back where the long driveway and circle turnaround are. The room we were setup in was the White Ballroom. It has large crystal chandeliers, marble and wooden floors, gold and white borders and a small stage for a musician or DJ. One side of the room looks out to the pool outdoors and the other side goes out to the courtyard. The event we did was an anniversary party and the table was setup in a U shape. All the guests had name tags around the tables with gorgeous plates and silverware setup just so. It was a like a fairy tale for you brides. The anniversary couple was setup in the very center of the table and the dance floor right in front of the main table.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd1FnB7-L54/UXYeJcgxD-I/AAAAAAAAAak/UTbEGu3umwI/s1600/CAM00098.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd1FnB7-L54/UXYeJcgxD-I/AAAAAAAAAak/UTbEGu3umwI/s320/CAM00098.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Comfortably the white ballroom can fit about 65-75 people and have an area to dance. The stage area is great to have entertainment setup and out of the way of the dance floor. This room would also look fantastic with some uplighting (see my uplighting blog) in numerous color types. Also for your guests there are a lot of great areas to have a cocktail hour and setup music or entertainment. You can use the patio area by the pool for the cocktail hour or the upstairs balcony as well. Pulling up a limo service or cars are super easy with the circle drive area right next to the white ballroom. For you photographers the pictures are great all around the facility. There's water fountains and gardens, ocean views and classical 18th century style.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the critique that everyone like's to read. Overall I'd give Maralargo in Palm Beach a 9.0 out of 10. This facility is a very formal atmosphere so suits and tuxes are something that many parties will want to indicate on their invitations. I'm not sure on the overall cost of Maralargo to rent but it's worth checking out if you're having an extravagant affair. Weddings, anniversary parties, corporate affairs and formal birthdays are some popular events customers have had there. There is an in house catering service but I don't see why you couldn't bring in your own catering as well. Caterers seemed like they were very good with working with the guests. We didn't get to much interaction with them but the valet and security at the front were very friendly. It's a great venue for a 5 star amazing formal experience so check it out.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.billmanphoto.com/">South Florida Photographer</a>&nbsp;</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>";s:4:"link";s:80:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-maralargo-club-palm-beach-florida.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:5810:"<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a venue that is one for the record books.

The Royal Poinciana Chapel in Palm Beach Florida right on the island, is a very upscale and elegant place to have your wedding reception. For those of you looking for a venue in the west palm beach area this is a great idea for a location for everything; Wedding ceremony, cocktail hour, reception.</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GvWXR_CjzUI/UWxj7DwjAdI/AAAAAAAAAYA/iYzQNj9K52k/s1600/CAM00091.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GvWXR_CjzUI/UWxj7DwjAdI/AAAAAAAAAYA/iYzQNj9K52k/s320/CAM00091.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Royal Poinciana Chapel is located on the island of Palm Beach right next to the Flagler Museum. It's fairly easy to get into and parking is available throughout the facility. You have a couple of options, you can get married in the chapel area or outside on the gorgeous lawn area under the large trees. They also have a very nice patio area with overhang where your cocktail hour could be held. They have house music built into the facility or you can have a DJ play some music outside as they had us do. The outside can comfortably fit about 80 people. Your caterer can setup tables an beverage station outside for the guests. For you photographers or anyone hiring a photographer the view is great! It's right by the intracoastal waterway in West Palm Beach.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vGu5bxdC2KI/UWxkz4KKEVI/AAAAAAAAAYI/OOVIWlPNz78/s1600/CAM00092.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vGu5bxdC2KI/UWxkz4KKEVI/AAAAAAAAAYI/OOVIWlPNz78/s320/CAM00092.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As we make our way indoors from the patio we have the reception ballroom. It features a nice open room with chandeliers lining the ceilings. As I said the room is pretty upscale. It is carpeted throughout most of the room and on the north end of the room where the musicians setup or DJ it has a wood floor. You will have to look into a catering service as the has a kitchen area but most clients bring in their own caterers. You may also have to rent tables and chairs for the room. The bride &amp; groom for this wedding hired a company who set everything up. The actual reception hall can accommodate about 100-115 people comfortably. The food was setup as a buffet style on the east and west sides of the room and the beverage station was located on the south end of the room. This room doesn't need a lot of decorating as it's nice and open and can be mostly setup on the tables.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's my review on Royal Poinciana Chapel. The building is super easy to get your equipment into. The building has side doors and parking spots right up front to take your party props, equipment, tables &amp; chairs etc, into the reception. The facility has lots of parking both at the Flagler museum next door and in the chapel parking lot. You have 2 option for getting married, either out on the lush lawn or inside the chapel. The room accommodates a good number of people and has a nice patio area for cocktail hours. The caterers we worked with were very friendly and courteous. We didn't get a chance to talk with anyone running Royal Poinciana but it wasn't hard getting in and out with no hassle. Overall I will give this venue a 9 out of 10. The only thing that you will have to find out is having a caterer. The patio area is not covered completely and there was a little rain. This is a great facility for weddings and worth checking into for anyone in the palm beach county area.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.djbillman.com/">DJ Stuart FL</a>&nbsp;</span>";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/04/royal-poinciana-chapel-palm-beach.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:5238:"<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next posting we got to perform at a new facility and as always got to take in the setting of this venue we've had the pleasure of working at. The Royal Poinciana Chapel in Palm Beach Florida right on the island, is a very upscale and elegant place to have your wedding reception. For those of you looking for a venue in the west palm beach area this is a great idea for a location for everything; Wedding ceremony, cocktail hour, reception.</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GvWXR_CjzUI/UWxj7DwjAdI/AAAAAAAAAYA/iYzQNj9K52k/s1600/CAM00091.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GvWXR_CjzUI/UWxj7DwjAdI/AAAAAAAAAYA/iYzQNj9K52k/s320/CAM00091.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Royal Poinciana Chapel is located on the island of Palm Beach right next to the Flagler Museum. It's fairly easy to get into and parking is available throughout the facility. You have a couple of options, you can get married in the chapel area or outside on the gorgeous lawn area under the large trees. They also have a very nice patio area with overhang where your cocktail hour could be held. They have house music built into the facility or you can have a DJ play some music outside as they had us do. The outside can comfortably fit about 80 people.

The venue Pietros on the River is located up in the Jensen Beach area on Hutchinson island. It's great for anyone living in the Stuart, Jensen Beach, Port St Lucie and even Ft Pierce areas.

For medium size weddings and events this is a great place to look into. The building also features a drive up overhang for dropping off guests and of course staying dry in the ever changing Florida weather. As you first walk in the door the restrooms are on the left side and have nice areas for changing clothes, (for you musicians and guests) and on the right side is another smaller party room and the main office. In the main hall it has a gorgeous piano setup and restaurant area. Make your way to the right of the restaurant area and around the corner to the main party room. There are 2 small steps up to this level but it does have a ramp outside going to the door for anyone in a wheel chair or bringing in heavy equipment. The dance floor is at the very front of the room and DJ booth or musician can setup right next to the dance floor. There are power outlets extremely close to the setup area.The guest tables are arranged around the dance floor.

Right by the beach waterway area is a gazebo for ceremonies. It can comfortably seat about 60-75 people. You can also capture some photos near the golf course and around the venue. Cocktail hours can be inside or outside on the small patio area. But on a hot day you may want to have it inside or around the pool area.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes my ratings part. Usually the bride, grooms, vendors and viewers look forward to hearing the pros and cons. It makes their lives easier when working at a venue. The main room shown in this picture can hold about 70 people comfortably, so I would say small to medium size weddings are the best. If your guest list is over 100 it might be a little more tricky. The staff was accommodating and friendly, which is a plus in my book. They coordinated the timeline very well and had everything ready, food, champagne poured and cake utensils. The food was very good as well, I had a chance to have dinner there. Another thing about the room is it's right next to the main dining room and it's mostly open with no partition. So you may have to watch the noise level of your music. We tried to regulate the volume as best as possible but usually with a crowd on the dance floor it's a task.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So overall I would give Pietro's on the River Jensen Beach an 8.5 out of 10. It has just about everything you could want for a medium size wedding. Brides and grooms in the Treasure coast, it's worth looking into. If you're looking for an elegant beach style venue this is a great pick.

The Mansion at Tuckahoe which is the former Coca Cola owners home in the early 1900s is a extremely large home on a hill overlooking the intracoastal waterway of Jensen Beach. This building was remodeled in the 2000s and turned into a popular banquet facility for many brides and grooms, party planners and corporate events.&nbsp; </span></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ahac44njIo/UVI9CmelEaI/AAAAAAAAAOo/xgrxy3G6bUI/s1600/CAM00065.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ahac44njIo/UVI9CmelEaI/AAAAAAAAAOo/xgrxy3G6bUI/s320/CAM00065.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building features 2 stories with dressing rooms for weddings, a split bottom floor in the center with a larger room for dancing and dinner and the other side of the wall for a bar and gift area. The building has a full room setup for a buffet and on the other side of the building is room for lots of guest tables. There is a drive up area for dropping off guests or parking at the bottom of the hill. Staff has been on hand to bring guests up on golf carts to the facility for the events. The main room on the south side of the building has been a place where music and dancing usually happens. There's not a lot of space for dancing or a band, DJ or musician. It's best for a small to medium size setup. There's also nice decor such as a fireplace, staircase and pillar style separators.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Tuckahoe Mansion in Jensen Beach doesn't have in house catering so you will have to look around for your preferred catering service and bar service. There is staff that runs the Mansion at Tuckahoe and can set everything up for you. I believe Martin County parks and recreation is in charge of the facility. For those of you having a ceremony, cocktail hour and reception for your wedding, there's a lot of space for the entire thing. There's a nice area down the hill with a small stage area for ceremonies. For you musicians there's power right on the stage. You can put your archway right on the stage and line the guests chairs in front facing the stage. It's a little bit of a walk from the ceremony to the mansion building. The Mansion at Tuckahoe also has a super large patio area on the north end great for cocktail hours and even the reception. But keep in mind about weather, you may need a tent if you're going to be outside at certain times of the year.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For your photographer or videographer the Mansion at Tuckahoe offers some nice scenery and backgrounds for those great photos. The waterway is on the east side of the building along with the park area and nice stairway shots. The layout of this building is pretty creative and offers a place for every part of your event. We've worked both indoors and outdoors at the facility. During the spring and summer it's pretty warm so you may want to consider having your event inside. This facility is great for a number of events from weddings to Sweet 16s and corporate affairs to company picnics.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is my critique section of the post. Overall it's a great building for most events. The layout inside can be a little difficult for your entertainment needs as it's a long room with a limited space once you have tables in it. It's capable of holding about 80-100 guests indoors and up to 150 guests outdoors comfortably. I give the Tuckahoe Mansion an 8 out of 10. You will have to look into your own catering and bar. Plus setting up the rooms how you want can take a little thought. The site is a beautiful building and fun, relaxing venue for that ocean beachy atmosphere. Having the upstairs rooms are really nice for changing attire during a wedding. We didn't get to speak to the staff while there as they were extremely busy and only a few were on site. This is definitely an option for anyone looking for a unique venue in Jensen Beach or in the treasure coast for that matter.</span><br /><br /><i><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you're planning on having an event here or already did leave your comments and questions.</span></i><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.djbillman.com/">DJ Port St Lucie</a>&nbsp;</span>";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-mansion-at-tuckahoe-jensen-beach.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:5916:"<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our next post is all about a hidden venue that more and more people are discovering as a popular wedding place and even company party facility. The Mansion at Tuckahoe which is the former Coca Cola owners home in the early 1900s is a extremely large home on a hill overlooking the intracoastal waterway of Jensen Beach. This building was remodeled in the 2000s and turned into a popular banquet facility for many brides and grooms, party planners and corporate events.&nbsp; </span></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ahac44njIo/UVI9CmelEaI/AAAAAAAAAOo/xgrxy3G6bUI/s1600/CAM00065.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ahac44njIo/UVI9CmelEaI/AAAAAAAAAOo/xgrxy3G6bUI/s320/CAM00065.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building features 2 stories with dressing rooms for weddings, a split bottom floor in the center with a larger room for dancing and dinner and the other side of the wall for a bar and gift area. The building has a full room setup for a buffet and on the other side of the building is room for lots of guest tables. There is a drive up area for dropping off guests or parking at the bottom of the hill. Staff has been on hand to bring guests up on golf carts to the facility for the events. The main room on the south side of the building has been a place where music and dancing usually happens. There's not a lot of space for dancing or a band, DJ or musician. It's best for a small to medium size setup. There's also nice decor such as a fireplace, staircase and pillar style separators.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Tuckahoe Mansion in Jensen Beach doesn't have in house catering so you will have to look around for your preferred catering service and bar service. There is staff that runs the Mansion at Tuckahoe and can set everything up for you. I believe Martin County parks and recreation is in charge of the facility. For those of you having a ceremony, cocktail hour and reception for your wedding, there's a lot of space for the entire thing. There's a nice area down the hill with a small stage area for ceremonies. For you musicians there's power right on the stage. You can put your archway right on the stage and line the guests chairs in front facing the stage. It's a little bit of a walk from the ceremony to the mansion building. The Mansion at Tuckahoe also has a super large patio area on the north end great for cocktail hours and even the reception. But keep in mind about weather, you may need a tent if you're going to be outside at certain times of the year.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For your photographer or videographer the Mansion at Tuckahoe offers some nice scenery and backgrounds for those great photos. The waterway is on the east side of the building along with the park area and nice stairway shots. The layout of this building is pretty creative and offers a place for every part of your event. We've worked both indoors and outdoors at the facility. During the spring and summer it's pretty warm so you may want to consider having your event inside. This facility is great for a number of events from weddings to Sweet 16s and corporate affairs to company picnics.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is my critique section of the post. Overall it's a great building for most events. The layout inside can be a little difficult for your entertainment needs as it's a long room with a limited space once you have tables in it. It's capable of holding about 80-100 guests indoors and up to 150 guests outdoors comfortably. I give the Tuckahoe Mansion an 8 out of 10. You will have to look into your own catering and bar. Plus setting up the rooms how you want can take a little thought. The site is a beautiful building and fun, relaxing venue for that ocean beachy atmosphere.

I have worked here hundreds of times over the years and my experience with every event is always a little different. Benvenuto's Catering and banquet hall of Boynton Beach Florida. Originally Benvenuto's was a restaurant that people could have dinner at and they also catered to parties and weddings. Now Benvenutos Boynton Beach is completely all weddings and special events.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bcadfla.org/benvenuto.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="273" src="http://www.bcadfla.org/benvenuto.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benvenuto's Caters to 4 specific types of events; Weddings, Sweet 16s, Bar &amp; Bat Mitzvahs and Birthday Parties. I've had the opportunity to perform for all these kinds of events at this facility. If you're looking for a traditional party venue that is extremely close to I-95 and the main roadways, this is a good place to look into. The main entrance has a large parking lot out front for plenty of guest parking with a drive up area and overhang cover incase of rain. The lobby leads into a square shaped facility with a large event room on the east side of the building and several smaller event rooms including a bar and lounge area on the west side. There's a total of 5 rooms to have your event in plus an outdoor courtyard which is nice for ceremonies and even cocktail hours.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The courtyard has a small alter area with open space for a comfortable 80-100 guests. The large main room on the east side of the facility can hold about 100-130 guests and is great for much larger crowds. It has a large dance floor and wide open room to surround your dance floor with tables. For your vendors to bring in their equipment theirs a back paring lot on the south side of the building available and has a door leading right into their main room. It's extremely easy access to that room. There's 3 other party rooms on the west side of Benvenutos. The Fireplace room is much smaller for guests of 25-30 people and has a cozy fireplace on the back wall in the room with a small dance floor as you first walk in. Smaller events and cocktail hour type events are just fine for this room. Across the way is the Coral room that houses about 40-50 guests comfortably and can be used for a birthday party. This room is facing the courtyard which is a nice view for your party. The Garden Room is right next door and has a nice open dance floor with pillars in the middle. You can comfortably hold about 50-60 people and the DJ can be right on the dance floor facing the guests. Last but not least the bar lounge area. It's in the west corner of the facility. I've performed cocktail hours with a powered speaker and music for the guests.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So as far as room options at Benvenutos Boynton Beach, you have numerous options for your guests. The catering is all in house and servers &amp; staff are available to help with food and beverage service. Here's the part that many of my customers and readers wait to find out about the venues. I always keep track of how many times I work at a facility and pay attention to all the details of a venue. I have been to Benvenutos Catering over 250 times in my career. I never like to speak negatively about any facility, what I do is critique it mostly. Benvenuto's in my book is a 7 out of 10. The facility is a nice place to have your event but it is a much older venue. So keep in mind that it's not a real modern place. The building also is a tad bit tight to bring in equipment. So if you're bringing in a large setup or lots of party props make sure you have them compact. Here's the kicker.......DJs, bands, musicians, if you're playing music in any of the smaller rooms you have to walk directly through the kitchen around long narrow hallways and through doors to get to your destination. It's not hard to do if you have a small setup but keep in mind, extra time for setup! I'm not fond of the layout but you have to work with what's there. A plus for the facility is their are 2 sets of restrooms in the building so that is great for your guests, plus a bridal getting ready room.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the staff are friendly but getting in there as a top priority vendor is not easy. You have to be one of their regulars and a favorite to be remembered as a recommendation. If you're in good with the management, then your on the list. That's a note to any vendors. One last thing is a good tip to keep in mind for you brides and grooms or party planning people. This facility is a super fast paced venue. They always have several events going on at once and they have lots of staff to cover the events. But the high paced one event comes in and next one comes out can be difficult if you want a more laid back setting. They seem to be fairly popular though. Benvenutos in Boynton Beach Florida on US1 Federal Highway just south of Gateway Blvd is a nice venue overall and has many things to offer.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>&nbsp;If you want to know anything else about this venue feel free to post your questions &amp; comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i> </i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><a href="http://www.djbillman.com/">DJ Stuart FL</a>&nbsp;</i></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><a href="http://radio.djbillman.com/">Billman Internet Radio Florida</a>&nbsp;</i></span>";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/03/benvenutos-catering-and-banquet.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:7219:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Here is the post that I've been waiting to write and many of my customers have wanted to hear about.

I personally have not had the pleasure of performing at the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida until this past weekend. My other DJs performed their in years past and enjoyed the great scenery. The Sundy house has some history based upon the venue and this is a great little getaway for those who want a small south Florida paradise with a taste of rivers, trees and cute gazebos.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7qJBPGd5sw8/UUQqcCf8biI/AAAAAAAAAK8/WcpF4r3AblU/s1600/CAM00058.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7qJBPGd5sw8/UUQqcCf8biI/AAAAAAAAAK8/WcpF4r3AblU/s320/CAM00058.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I was told that originally the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida was the home of the first Mayor of Delray Beach, Florida. This home was remodeled more recently and turned into a hotel cottage type of venue with a restaurant, bar and lounge in the separate buildings and lush green natural areas throughout the facility. If you're a bride and groom looking for great photos to remember by, this is definitely worth checking out. The venue has all it's own catering and reception area with dining room on the outside portion of the main building. The walk ways feature a stone side walk and trees lining every part of the area with streams and rivers flowing underneath bridges. The cottages are in the very back of the facility for privacy.&nbsp;</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xiCmSz5nKs/UUQqcJOU5OI/AAAAAAAAAK8/-VCVMcoc8Zc/s1600/CAM00056.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xiCmSz5nKs/UUQqcJOU5OI/AAAAAAAAAK8/-VCVMcoc8Zc/s320/CAM00056.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I setup outside on the back patio which is covered in-case of any rain or weather conditions. The dining room is to the left of where the DJ booth was setup and the have the dance area directly in front of the DJ booth. There's a separate kitchen where they prepare the food and then set it up as a buffet out in the bar area. From what I could tell it was very easy access to the food and a very casual atmosphere. The dance space is not real big but comfortably fits about 20-30 people at a time on the floor and you can have a guest count of up to 100 people if needed. There are tables in and around by the gazebos for extra guests.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_vWx0-wfb0s/UUQqcL5hK1I/AAAAAAAAAK8/IrX-27qp6no/s1600/CAM00057.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_vWx0-wfb0s/UUQqcL5hK1I/AAAAAAAAAK8/IrX-27qp6no/s320/CAM00057.jpg" width="320" /></a> </span></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now if you read my other blogs I try to share my thoughts on the staff, overall ease of access and other features, well here it is. For you performers, musicians and DJs / Disc Jockeys bringing your gear in you can park in the side parking lot (valet lot) and bring your gear in through a small gate in the corner. That was super convenient! But at 11pm the gate was locked so I had to drive around and bring everything through the front entrance. It wasn't the end of the world and I managed to get everything packed up. But it is a little of a walk, so for those of you who have lots of party favors, party props, gear, etc, schedule extra loading time. The food was very good and I actually got to try it. It was a buffet with an array of foods. (Italian food mostly) The staff was friendly and helpful which is always a plus when working anywhere new. They worked with me on the timeline and order of events. There's a great place by a small pond area that is for ceremonies and cocktail hours. This is great for separating the reception from the ceremony. There are power outlets throughout the facility for those of you who need it, and its many of us. The valet seemed very efficient and was helpful and friendly right when I pulled up.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Overall I'd give the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida a 9 out of 10. Everything was excellent, except the packing up and getting your equipment can be a tad bit tricky but just have good planning on how to move your equipment and props.

I personally have not had the pleasure of performing at the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida until this past weekend. My other DJs performed their in years past and enjoyed the great scenery. The Sundy house has some history based upon the venue and this is a great little getaway for those who want a small south Florida paradise with a taste of rivers, trees and cute gazebos.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7qJBPGd5sw8/UUQqcCf8biI/AAAAAAAAAK8/WcpF4r3AblU/s1600/CAM00058.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7qJBPGd5sw8/UUQqcCf8biI/AAAAAAAAAK8/WcpF4r3AblU/s320/CAM00058.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I was told that originally the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida was the home of the first Mayor of Delray Beach, Florida. This home was remodeled more recently and turned into a hotel cottage type of venue with a restaurant, bar and lounge in the separate buildings and lush green natural areas throughout the facility. If you're a bride and groom looking for great photos to remember by, this is definitely worth checking out. The venue has all it's own catering and reception area with dining room on the outside portion of the main building. The walk ways feature a stone side walk and trees lining every part of the area with streams and rivers flowing underneath bridges. The cottages are in the very back of the facility for privacy.&nbsp;</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xiCmSz5nKs/UUQqcJOU5OI/AAAAAAAAAK8/-VCVMcoc8Zc/s1600/CAM00056.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xiCmSz5nKs/UUQqcJOU5OI/AAAAAAAAAK8/-VCVMcoc8Zc/s320/CAM00056.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I setup outside on the back patio which is covered in-case of any rain or weather conditions. The dining room is to the left of where the DJ booth was setup and the have the dance area directly in front of the DJ booth. There's a separate kitchen where they prepare the food and then set it up as a buffet out in the bar area. From what I could tell it was very easy access to the food and a very casual atmosphere. The dance space is not real big but comfortably fits about 20-30 people at a time on the floor and you can have a guest count of up to 100 people if needed. There are tables in and around by the gazebos for extra guests.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_vWx0-wfb0s/UUQqcL5hK1I/AAAAAAAAAK8/IrX-27qp6no/s1600/CAM00057.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_vWx0-wfb0s/UUQqcL5hK1I/AAAAAAAAAK8/IrX-27qp6no/s320/CAM00057.jpg" width="320" /></a> </span></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now if you read my other blogs I try to share my thoughts on the staff, overall ease of access and other features, well here it is. For you performers, musicians and DJs / Disc Jockeys bringing your gear in you can park in the side parking lot (valet lot) and bring your gear in through a small gate in the corner. That was super convenient! But at 11pm the gate was locked so I had to drive around and bring everything through the front entrance. It wasn't the end of the world and I managed to get everything packed up. But it is a little of a walk, so for those of you who have lots of party favors, party props, gear, etc, schedule extra loading time. The food was very good and I actually got to try it. It was a buffet with an array of foods. (Italian food mostly) The staff was friendly and helpful which is always a plus when working anywhere new. They worked with me on the timeline and order of events. There's a great place by a small pond area that is for ceremonies and cocktail hours. This is great for separating the reception from the ceremony. There are power outlets throughout the facility for those of you who need it, and its many of us. The valet seemed very efficient and was helpful and friendly right when I pulled up.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Overall I'd give the Sundy House in Delray Beach Florida a 9 out of 10. Everything was excellent, except the packing up and getting your equipment can be a tad bit tricky but just have good planning on how to move your equipment and props. It's also by downtown Delray Beach which is a lot of fun with bars and lounges, shops and restaurants on the main strip (Atlantic Avenue).

I know quite a bit about this venue as I've played events over 30 times here and also got married myself here. The facility is situated right on the intracoastal waterway in a wide open park area on basically an island. This building is a 2 story building which holds the main reception party room on the second floor. Indian Riverside Park is great for that tropical ocean beach wedding you want on a small to medium budget. Let's take a close look into Indian Riverside Park's reception facility.&nbsp;</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.kirchmanconstruction.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Indian-River-Side-Park.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://www.kirchmanconstruction.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Indian-River-Side-Park.jpg" width="320" />&nbsp;</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From what I recall you have to rent the facility from the parks and recreation center of Martin County. The cost is roughly a little over a thousand to rent out. I believe you can rent the facility for 4-6 hour periods. The building features both a stairway to get to the second floor and an elevator for the DJs, musicians, caterers, and vendors to bring their equipment up. The room is quite large, open and airy. The best part is it's air conditioned or you can open all the large glass doors to let the ocean breeze in on those gorgeous cool days. The second floor over looks a long dock area great for ceremonies or photos of the guest of honors. The room holds a nice amount of guests about 125-140 comfortably and tables can be spread around a dance floor in the center. I don't believe there is a permanent dance floor in the room so you may have to look into the martin county parks and rec about having the dance floor. Another great feature is a small kitchen area in the corner of the room for serving food and beverages. There's plenty of room to setup buffet stations and beverage areas, plus a gifts table, cake table, etc.&nbsp; </span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; A couple of details you may want to work out between the entertainment and customer or vice-versa is where they will setup. Sometimes I've been setup on the wall closest to the waterway and sometimes I'm setup across the room on the opposite side of the room near the dance floor. Running extension cords can be a little ways over so make sure you have the taped down neatly for you entertainers or party planners. This has plenty of space for a nice open dance floor. Another small issue I find is parking on certain days. Saturdays in the spring and summer are extremely busy days and numerous cars are parked throughout Indian Riverside Park. So you may want to plan to find the spaces to park. The drive area is not covered but offers a nice circle turnaround to load and unload party props, gear, etc. The distance can be a little far also getting to Indian Riverside Park as it's over a bridge and a ways into the Hutchinson Island / Jensen Beach area. Allow plenty of time getting to this location from I-95 or the Turnpike.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I would give this venue an 8 out 10 which is a very good rating. The size of the venue is great! You have to cater your own food and parking can sometimes be difficult. But overall it's a great place to have your wedding, sweet 16, birthday, anniversary, even a corporate event.

Yes, you're probably thinking, "wow it must have been freezing." Of course south Florida is the only area that stays mostly warm year round. But it was just a little chilly outside for the wedding reception we performed at this past evening. Make sure that whenever you perform or have an event outside to check the weather that day, have heaters or fans, etc. You just never know about weather conditions, they can change in an instant.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.riverpalmcottages.com/images/wedding/wedding_dance.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://www.riverpalmcottages.com/images/wedding/wedding_dance.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not our DJ setup in this photo and I don't take credit for this picture, this is directly off River Palm Cottages Jensen Beach Website. This is the main tiki hut above with the open dance floor in the very center. As you first drive into the River Cottages main road it takes you around to the tiki hut and main reception area. Parking is around the small cottages and an additional parking area is available on the north end of the facility. For party planners, caterers, DJs and musicians setup is super easy. You can actually drive your vehicle right up to the building and load and unload equipment, party props and food. There is a full bar on the south side of the hut and a gorgeous dock area on the east side leading right out to the intro-coastal waterway. DJs and musicians can setup right by the bar area. From where your vehicle is parked to load and unload equipment and/or party props is maybe 25 feet. The night we performed, there was a buffet table setup directly behind the bar area. The tables and chairs were setup under a tent attached to the tiki hut area. I am not sure if that is part of the building or something you can add onto the hut. It made a difference for wind and weather. I would check out that when you go to see the place.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will probably have to hire your own catering to provide the food for your event or I'm sure the facility has some recommendations. For the wedding we performed at the ceremony was just down the way on the lawn facing the waterway. Excellent for photographers and easy access for guests. We have our own photographer who works for the our DJ company and the photos were excellent. So you can expect great pictures to look back on with great scenery. Restrooms were clean and easy to get to. Plus they have cottages for your guests if you're looking for a place to stay.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For anyone looking to have a wedding, sweet 16, birthday or other tropical beachy atmosphere party, this is a cool place available for just that. It comfortably fits 100-125 guests and the dance floor is nice and open. Having the bar right next to the dance floor keeps your guests close and part of the event. Keep in mind that this venue is mostly set outdoors, so make sure you plan to have it during a warmer part of the year. It can be chilly between January and April in south Florida.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They had heating lamps and covers to enclose the facility too. </span>The only downside is the venue is a little ways east of the highway for those flying in or driving a ways. But other than that it's a cool, relaxing place for your party or reception. Check out River Palm Cottages in Jensen Beach Florida just south of Jensen Beach Blvd.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For any questions, comments or responses feel free to post them and I'll respond.

I would check out that when you go to see the place.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will probably have to hire your own catering to provide the food for your event or I'm sure the facility has some recommendations. For the wedding we performed at the ceremony was just down the way on the lawn facing the waterway. Excellent for photographers and easy access for guests. We have our own photographer who works for the our DJ company and the photos were excellent. So you can expect great pictures to look back on with great scenery. Restrooms were clean and easy to get to. Plus they have cottages for your guests if you're looking for a place to stay.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For anyone looking to have a wedding, sweet 16, birthday or other tropical beachy atmosphere party, this is a cool place available for just that. It comfortably fits 100-125 guests and the dance floor is nice and open. Having the bar right next to the dance floor keeps your guests close and part of the event. Keep in mind that this venue is mostly set outdoors, so make sure you plan to have it during a warmer part of the year. It can be chilly between January and April in south Florida.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They had heating lamps and covers to enclose the facility too. </span>The only downside is the venue is a little ways east of the highway for those flying in or driving a ways. But other than that it's a cool, relaxing place for your party or reception. Check out River Palm Cottages in Jensen Beach Florida just south of Jensen Beach Blvd.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For any questions, comments or responses feel free to post them and I'll respond.

We had the opportunity to work at the Jupiter Beach Resort in Jupiter Florida recently and worked in one of their smaller rooms out by the pool. This venue is definitely a great place for weddings and corporate events.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Jupiter Beach Resort has gorgeous decor and long hallways with elegant layouts in each room to offer those a 5 star experience. It is definitely a great place for a corporate affair or company gathering as we were able to witness several going on during our meetings with brides and grooms. Their are a few rooms to pick from for your upcoming event. They have a smaller room for lite to medium size events and a full size ballroom available for those high end large sweet 16s, weddings, corporate events and more.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.totsandtravel.com/images/hotels/US_FL/jupiter_beach_resort_spa_florida-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://www.totsandtravel.com/images/hotels/US_FL/jupiter_beach_resort_spa_florida-main.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The one major thing we experience while at the Jupiter Beach Resort was the personality of the staff and managers at the hotel. From walking in the door to the last part of the evening it was a pleasure to work with everyone at the resort. They were courteous, friendly and worked with our timeline throughout the wedding. They did keep a tight schedule at the event we were performing at and made sure that the time that was scheduled was set moment to moment. If you believe that your guests may want to stay additional time for the party or event than you may want to discuss that with the Jupiter Beach Resort. Getting to the hotel is fairly easy and it's just 15 minutes east from I-95 off of Indiantown Road in Jupiter Florida. You can't get any closer to the beach as the hotel is directly on it. Their pool is gorgeous and they have a tiki area that is right next to the ocean. The hotel also features a restaurant as you walk in the main door to the left. Jupiter Beach also offers in-house catering which is most likely part of their packages for events.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now for you mobile DJs performing or if you're a vendor such as photo booth, photographer, etc, getting equipment to where you need it isn't the easiest around. They do have a loading dock available around the back bottom floor of the hotel. You go up a ramp around the hallway and up the elevator. Then you have to take your equipment around the hallway either through the restaurant to the party room or to the main ballroom. Allow plenty of time to setup. When we setup for our event we came in from the loading dock. You may want to come in the main doors at the front of the hotel which could save you some time. It's best to make a stop by the venue just to check it out. The parking can sometimes be limited if there is more than one event happening.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Overall the Jupiter Beach Resort in Jupiter Florida is a nice place for your wedding, corporate function, sweet 16 or any upscale special event. We would give it an 8.5 out of 10 for wonderful hospitality and professionalism. The parking can be difficult and the offloading equipment, party favors and party props can be a little tedious but with extra time and proper planning everything will work out great. So if you're looking for tropical paradise on the beach and are planning a fun elegant event check this venue out.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For questions, comments or responses add them below and I'll be happy to reply.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Billman</span><br /><br /><a href="http://Wedding Disc Jockeys Florida"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">www.weddingdiscjockeys.co&nbsp; </span></a>";s:4:"link";s:81:"http://djbillman.blogspot.com/2013/02/jupiter-beach-resort-wedding-and-party.html";s:6:"author";s:32:"noreply@blogger.com (Dj Billman)";s:7:"summary";s:5401:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I've been brainstorming on this next blog trying to keep the party planners, venue searchers and web surfers up to date on the best places to have their event.

We're of course just getting started on what's yet to come on south Florida venues. We have just scratched the surface of venues in the South Florida area. We have focused mainly on the Palm Beach area and are working our way into the Broward and Dade area as well. Our next destination of interest is The Players Club &amp; Restuarant in Wellington Florida. This facility is located in the western communities of the Palm Beaches 30 minutes west of the Palm Beach area.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Players club is a lounge type of atmosphere and caters to those looking for more of a night club lounge atmosphere. It has 2 floors to the building and a drive way area with over hang. Which of course is always convenient for those of you dropping guests off to the main door and want to stay out of the weather. As you drive up to the main entrance the normally have a valet person there to help you with your car. So that can be a plus for those of you wanting to leave it up to the valet. Once you walk in the main door there's a long hallway to the main party room. There's double doors into the main room which is a large open area, great for keeping the focus on the dance floor in the center. There are also lights built into the facility so that your entertainment doesn't have to bring their lighting. The dance floor is usually in the center of the room and tables surrounding the dance area.&nbsp;</span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uim3rC72ux0/UR3hlTa8c0I/AAAAAAAAAJI/R-vgxSNgFgQ/s1600/playersclubwellington.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uim3rC72ux0/UR3hlTa8c0I/AAAAAAAAAJI/R-vgxSNgFgQ/s320/playersclubwellington.jpg" width="320" />&nbsp;</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's where your DJ is going to be ecstatic!

For those of you who are hiring a DJ or are a mobile DJ this might be a nice feature so you don't have to have equipment. Now I will be honest, I normally bring my own table and equipment only because I like to be close to the crowd and dance floor. Depending on what you're doing or who you have working with you can have a DJ up in the booth and an MC down on the floor. Just bring your laptop or mixing setup and music and you're ready to rock the house.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This main room can comfortably fit about 80-100 people and have room to spare. We've seen many people have buffet style dinners in here and it also features a bar area to the side of the room. There's a separate room connected to the main ballroom of the Players club that is great for preparing your bridal party or guests of honor. It's a smaller lounge style room great for small groups of people or preparing your event.

That could be your after party or downtown West Palm Beach is a straight shot down Forest Hill Blvd about 25-30 minutes for those of you who like to party and then party some more. One last thing about the Players club to finish out this post. It also has a patio area outside near the polo fields. It's great for fall and winter events but having something during the summer outside can be difficult. The mosquitoes in the summer time out in the western Wellington area can be a little overwhelming.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall the Players Club in Wellington Florida is a great place for small to medium weddings, sweet 16s, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs and much more.

Parking isn't fairly easy and there's enough space for those who want to have several activities going at once, DJ, food, entertainers, etc.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Feel free to post your questions comments and more and I'd be happy to add to them.&nbsp;</span></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">- Billman</span></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.weddingdiscjockeys.co/">Wedding DJ Boynton Beach</a>&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1360914180;}}s:7:"channel";a:7:{s:13:"lastbuilddate";s:31:"Mon, 05 Mar 2018 22:19:23 +0000";s:5:"title";s:41:"South Florida Gig Log and Event DJ Venues";s:11:"description";s:453:"Gig log is a blog designed to tell you all about the DJ entertainment and event planning industry.
